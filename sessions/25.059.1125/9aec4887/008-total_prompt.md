Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a larger grid into a smaller one by representing specific colored regions.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8), yellow (4), red (2), blue (1), and green (3) within the input grid.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 6x6 output grid filled with zeros.

3.  **Place Yellow:** Place a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels across the top row of the output grid, leaving one empty cell (0) at each end.

4.  **Outline Azure:** Trace the outline of the azure (8) object in the input grid. Start from the top-leftmost pixel of the azure object. Proceed clockwise around the *outer* boundary of the azure shape, placing an 8 in the corresponding cell in the output grid. *Do not* trace internal connections within the azure shape. *Skip* any azure pixels that do not form part of the outer boundary.

5.  **Place Red:** Place a vertical line of red (2) pixels in the leftmost column of the output grid. The red line should extend from the second row to the second-to-last row.

6.  **Place Blue:** Place a vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the rightmost column of the output grid. The blue line should extend from the second row to the second-to-last row.

7.  **Place Green:** Place a horizontal line of green (3) pixels across the bottom row of the output grid, leaving one empty cell (0) at each end.

8.  **Fill Remaining:** Ensure that the corner cells and any other cells not occupied by the placed objects are filled with zeros (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against all the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs well on the first example but fails to generalize to the other examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Scaling/Mapping of Azure Outline:** The scaling logic for the azure outline is too simplistic and doesn't correctly map the outline coordinates to the 6x6 output grid across different input sizes and shapes. It seems to assume a direct proportional scaling, which is not always appropriate. It also gets the scaling wrong by using the entire input grid size, instead of the bounding box of the azure object.
2.  **Overly Specific Object Placement:** The code assumes the presence of specific colored objects (red, blue, green) and places them in fixed positions. This doesn't hold true for all examples. Some examples only contain azure.
3. **Incorrect Outline Tracing:** The current outline tracing has issues that cause infinite loops and inaccurate traces, often including inner parts of shapes.

The strategy to address these issues will be:

1.  **Improve Outline Tracing:** Refactor `trace_outline` to correctly and completely trace only the *outer* boundary of the azure object.
2.  **Adaptive Scaling:** Develop a more robust scaling mechanism for the azure outline. This will involve finding the bounding box of the azure object in the input grid and mapping it proportionally to the inner 4x4 region of the output grid.
3.  **Conditional Object Placement:**  Rely only on the azure object for transformation. Remove the fixed placement of red, blue, green, and yellow. The core logic should only focus on the outline of the azure object and the frame.
4. **Frame Abstraction:** Abstract out the frame into a separate process so it can be clearly understood, and consistent.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered via code execution:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(task_data):
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output = transform(input_grid)  # Using the provided transform function
        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output, expected_output)
        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': predicted_output.shape,
            'expected_shape': expected_output.shape,
            'correct': correct,
            'predicted_output': predicted_output.tolist(),  # For easy viewing
            'expected_output': expected_output.tolist()
        })
    return results

# Assuming 'task' variable holds the task data (from JSON)
# you may need to adapt this line
task_data = task # replace with actual data load
analysis = analyze_results(task_data)

for i, result in enumerate(analysis):
    print(f"--- Example {i+1} ---")
    print(f"Input Shape: {result['input_shape']}")
    print(f"Predicted Output Shape: {result['output_shape']}")
    print(f"Expected Output Shape: {result['expected_shape']}")
    print(f"Correct: {result['correct']}")
    print(f"Predicted Output:\n{np.array(result['predicted_output'])}")
    print(f"Expected Output:\n{np.array(result['expected_output'])}")
    print()

```

**Example Analysis Summary (from code execution):**

*   **Example 1:** Correct. The initial code was designed based on this example.
*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. The azure outline is scaled incorrectly. The predicted output includes misplaced red, blue, green, and yellow lines.
*   **Example 3:** Incorrect. The azure outline is scaled incorrectly, and the extra colors are present and incorrect.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Create a 6x6 grid representing the outline of an object."
  - input_object:
      color: azure (8)
      description: "A contiguous region of azure pixels."
      properties:
        - "Has an outer boundary (outline)."
        - "Can have varying shapes and sizes."
  - output_grid:
      size: "6x6"
      default_value: "0 (white)"
  - frame:
      colors: [yellow(4), red(2), blue(1), green(3)]
      positions:
        - color: "4", location: top, start: 1, end: 4
        - color: "2", location: left, start: 1, end: 4
        - color: "1", location: right, start: 1, end: 4
        - color: "3", location: bottom, start: 1, end: 4

  - transformation_steps:
      - "Trace the outline of the azure object in the input grid."
      - "Map the outline to the inner 4x4 cells of the output grid."
      - "Draw a frame around the 4x4 grid"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a 6x6 grid filled with 0 (white).
2.  **Draw Frame:** Draw a frame on the output grid:
    *   Yellow (4) line across the top (columns 1-4).
    *   Red (2) line down the left side (rows 1-4).
    *   Blue (1) line down the right side (rows 1-4).
    *   Green (3) line across the bottom (columns 1-4).
3.  **Find Azure Object:** Identify the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Trace Outline:** Trace the *outer* outline of the azure object, proceeding clockwise from the top-leftmost azure pixel. Consider only pixels on the external boundary.
5.  **Scale and Map Outline:**
    *   Determine the bounding box of the azure object in the input grid (min/max row and column).
    *   Map the outline coordinates to the inner 4x4 region of the output grid (rows 1-4, columns 1-4). Scale proportionally based on the bounding box dimensions.
6. **Place Azure:** set the value of the scaled and mapped outline coordinates to azure (8).

This revised natural language program addresses the identified shortcomings by focusing solely on the azure object's outline for the core transformation and abstracting out the frame. It also highlights the need for improved outline tracing and a more robust scaling method.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
