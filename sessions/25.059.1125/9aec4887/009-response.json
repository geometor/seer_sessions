The input grid contains several distinct colored objects, each composed of contiguous pixels of the same color. The output grid seems to represent a compressed or abstracted version of the input, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors and a simplified shape. The spatial relationships and relative positions of colors within the objects in the input grid is important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
