facts:
  - observation: "All output grids are 5x5."
  - observation: "The output grids always exhibit a mirrored symmetry with respect to the colored pixels."
  - observation: "There is a center white column or row separating the mirror images."
  - observation: "The input always includes a vertical line of pixels, either a single pixel or many."
  - observation: "The input lines are always of the same color."
  - observation: "The lines or single pixels get duplicated on opposite sides of a central axis."
  - observation: "The lines are scaled, if necessary, in the mirrored transformation to best fit in the 5x5 output grid."
  - observation: "The axis of mirroring may be a column or a row of white pixels."
  - observation: "The length of the axis is either 1 or 3."
  - hypothesis: "The length of the axis is related to the length of the line segment."
