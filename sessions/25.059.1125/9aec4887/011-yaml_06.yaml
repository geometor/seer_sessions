- actions:
    - identify_objects: "Find contiguous regions of the same color."
    - bounding_box_per_object: "Determine the bounding box for EACH object."
    - extract_corners: "Get the color values at each corner of each object's bounding box (although we only need to know the color value once)"
    - arrange_output: "Place each object's color value in a pre-determined pattern, starting at (1,1) and proceeding down each column, then across each row to (4,4). The color is placed at (row, col) AND (row, col + 2), until all 4 instances of the color have been placed."
