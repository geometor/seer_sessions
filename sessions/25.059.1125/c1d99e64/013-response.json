            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal that the logic is not universally applicable to all examples. The primary issue seems to be an over-specificity to the features of the first example (specifically, focusing solely on the *center* column). Other examples demonstrate that the vertical white lines can exist and be transformed anywhere in the grid, not just at the center. The replacement color logic is correct.\n\nThe strategy for improvement is to:\n\n1.  **Generalize Line Detection:** Modify the logic to detect *all* vertical white lines in the grid, not just those intersecting the center column.\n2.  **Maintain Replacement Logic:** The existing color replacement logic is valid and should be kept.\n3.  **Verify through Code Execution:** Utilize `code_execution` to generate reports about grid characteristics (size, colors, white line positions) to confirm observations.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nLet's analyze each example and gather metrics using code execution where appropriate.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef report(grid, grid_name):\n    \"\"\"Generates a report on the grid's properties.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    white_lines = []\n    for col in range(cols):\n        in_segment = False\n        start_row = -1\n        for row in range(rows):\n            if grid[row, col] == 0:\n                if not in_segment:\n                    in_segment = True\n                    start_row = row\n            elif in_segment:\n                in_segment = False\n                white_lines.append((start_row, row - 1, col))\n                start_row = -1\n        if in_segment:\n            white_lines.append((start_row, rows - 1, col))\n\n    max_white_line_length = 0\n    if white_lines:\n        max_white_line_length = max(end -
