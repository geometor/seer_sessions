Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary colors observed are green (3) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve changing some of the white (0) pixels to red (2). The overall grid structure (dimensions) remains identical between input and output. The key seems to lie in *which* white pixels are changed, and what determines this selection. It appears to be a very localized, possibly a neighbor based, replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 17x15 (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - color_map: {0: white, 2: red, 3: green}
  - transformation:
    - type: color_change
    - input_color: 0 (white)
    - output_color: 2 (red)
    - condition: "specific white pixels are selected based on proximity to green"
  - observation:
    - description: "Grid dimensions remain constant"
  - spatial_relationship:
    - description: "Transformation based on neighboring pixels."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current pixel is white (0).
3.  **If** the current pixel is white (0), **then** **check** if any of the immediate adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) is green(3).
4. **If** at least one of these neighbor is Green(3), **change** to Red (2)
5.  **Else**, leave the pixel unchanged (keep it as 0).
6. Return the modified grid.

In summary, the transformation changes white pixels to red if they are directly adjacent to a green pixel, this seems to be the most simple and complete description of the rule.
