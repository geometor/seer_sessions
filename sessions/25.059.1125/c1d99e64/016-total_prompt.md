Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary colors observed are green (3) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve changing some of the white (0) pixels to red (2). The overall grid structure (dimensions) remains identical between input and output. The key seems to lie in *which* white pixels are changed, and what determines this selection. It appears to be a very localized, possibly a neighbor based, replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 17x15 (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - color_map: {0: white, 2: red, 3: green}
  - transformation:
    - type: color_change
    - input_color: 0 (white)
    - output_color: 2 (red)
    - condition: "specific white pixels are selected based on proximity to green"
  - observation:
    - description: "Grid dimensions remain constant"
  - spatial_relationship:
    - description: "Transformation based on neighboring pixels."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current pixel is white (0).
3.  **If** the current pixel is white (0), **then** **check** if any of the immediate adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) is green(3).
4. **If** at least one of these neighbor is Green(3), **change** to Red (2)
5.  **Else**, leave the pixel unchanged (keep it as 0).
6. Return the modified grid.

In summary, the transformation changes white pixels to red if they are directly adjacent to a green pixel, this seems to be the most simple and complete description of the rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
