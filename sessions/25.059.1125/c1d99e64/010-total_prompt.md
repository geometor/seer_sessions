Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (14x12).
*   The grids contain digits representing colors (0-9).
*   The primary colors involved are azure (8), white (0), and red (2).
*   The output grid is identical to the input grid except that some white (0) pixels are replaced with red (2).
*   The locations of the replacement is a vertical line in the center that lines up to a white pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 14x12
      elements: pixels
      colors: [azure (8), white (0), red (2)]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        azure: 8
        white: 0
        red: 2
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: replace
    properties:
      source_color: white (0)
      target_color: red (2)
      condition: "white pixel is in a specific vertical line"
      location: "center of the grid"

relationships:
   - "output grid is a modified copy of input grid"
   - "vertical line of replacement lines up with white pixels"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy** the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Find White Center Line.** Locate a vertical line through the center of the grid.
3.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through each white pixel in the grid.
4.   If the pixel is on the previously calculated center vertical line, change the color of the pixel from White(0) to Red(2)

In simpler terms: Copy the input grid. Draw a vertical line from top to bottom through the center. Replace the white pixels in the center line with Red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
