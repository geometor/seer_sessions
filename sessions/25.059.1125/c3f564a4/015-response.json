The input grid appears to have a repeating sequence of numbers both horizontally and vertically, with some '0' (white) pixels interspersed. The output grid seems to be a systematically modified version of the input, specifically, a shift of non-zero values.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The shift amount appears to be one row down. The values 'wrap' around the edges of the grid.\n\n3.  **Column Cyclic Shift:** For each row, shift the sequence of non-zero numbers one step right. The values wrap from right to left.\n\n4.  **Zero Replacement:** Pixels that were originally '0' in the input are replaced with the value from the above shift, effectively filling in the gaps that open up when the existing colors shifted.\n\nIn essence, the transformation performs a cyclic permutation of the non-zero values in the grid, shifting them down by one row, and to the right by one column. The zero are not moved, but take the values from the shifted pixels.\n"
