Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the assumption of a simple, horizontally and vertically repeating "1 2 3 4 5" sequence, replacing 0s with the appropriate number in the sequence. The tests reveal that this assumption is too simplistic. The actual rule is more complex and my previous assessment does not account for situations where there are preexisting numbers on any of the sides. I need to identify and correct for the situations that break this rule, by looking at neighbours.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the discrepancies, let's examine each example. I will produce an assessment by visual inspection.

**Example 0**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Observation:** The sequence starts correctly at 1 and proceeds to 5 in each row and column, wrapping as needed. However, it does seem that the existing digits determine where the sequence will go. The first 3 rows and last 3 rows are incorrect.

**Example 1**

*   **Input:**

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
* **Actual Output:**

    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```

*   **Observation:** The central column is correctly filled, continuing the sequence. All other cells remain unchanged.

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**

    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```

*   **Observation:** The existing sequence dictates where the 0s will change. The change is not simply propagate the central pattern across the whole output grid.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-5)
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable

  - name: sequence
    type: repeating pattern
    elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    properties:
      direction: horizontal and vertical
      wrapping: true

actions:
  - name: identify_sequence
    input: grid
    description: Locate existing sequence of numbers within the grid

  - name: propagate_sequence
    input: grid, sequence
    description: >-
      Extend the identified sequence to fill '0' (white) cells
      adjacent to existing sequence elements, maintaining the correct order
      and wrapping around (5 to 1).

  - name: fill
    input: grid, sequence
    description: >
        replace 0 cell adjacent to a number in the correct sequence.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Existing Sequences:** Examine the input grid to locate existing, possibly partial, sequences of numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. These sequences can be horizontal or vertical.
2.  **Propagate Sequences:** For each identified sequence, and for each 0 cell immediately adjacent, fill in the appropriate sequence number. If a 0 cell is adjacent to multiple elements, use the element that correctly extends that sequence.
3. **Wrapping:** The sequence wraps around, meaning that after 5 comes 1.
4. **Blank Cells:** Zero value cells which are not next to a sequence element should be ignored.

The most important change is that, instead of radiating outwards to fill the entire array based on an assumed starting point, the logic should "extend" existing sequences, filling in adjacent 0s only. It is not generating the series, it is extending an existing sequence.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
