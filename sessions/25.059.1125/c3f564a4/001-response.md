Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of digits (colors). The grids appear to have repeating sequences of digits within each row, and these sequences shift from row to row. There are also regions of '0' (white) pixels.
*   **Output:** A rectangular grid of digits, very similar to the input, but with the '0' (white) regions removed. The repeating digit sequences and their shifts seem to be preserved.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be the removal of the '0's (white pixels), effectively "compressing" the remaining non-zero digits together.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      properties:
        - dimensions: rectangular
        - elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
        - patterns: repeating sequences of digits in rows
        - row_shifts: sequences shift horizontally across rows
      actions:
        - compress: remove all '0' elements
        - preserve_sequence: maintain the order of non-zero digits
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  For each row, **create a new row.**
3.  **Scan** the input row from left to right.
4. Copy **non-zero** digits from the input row into the new output.
5. **Skip zero (0) colored pixels**, not putting anything to the new output.
6.  The result is a "compressed" version of the input row, with all '0's removed.
7.  **Assemble** the compressed rows to create the output grid.

In essence, the transformation is a horizontal compression, eliminating all '0' valued pixels while preserving the relative order of all other colored pixels. The output grid retains the original height, but some sections change in width due to the compression of the 0 valued pixels.
