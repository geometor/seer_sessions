The input grids contain single, non-zero colored pixels scattered within a background of white (0) pixels. The output grids appear to be an expansion of these non-zero pixels into square blocks of the same color. The size of these blocks and the dimensions of the overall output grid seem related to the input grid size and number of colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output grid dimensions are determined by multiplying the input dimensions by the expansion factor of 3. The arrangement of the 3x3 colored blocks replicates the non-zero pixel locations from the input grid, scaled up.\n4. All other cells in the output will have color 0.\n\nEssentially the output is made by creating a 3x3 block for each non zero pixel\nof the same color, and arranging these blocks in the same layout as the input.\n\nThe size of the output grid is the number of rows/columns of non-zero pixels x 3.\n\nThe size of the blocks depends on the number of the colored pixels.\n"
