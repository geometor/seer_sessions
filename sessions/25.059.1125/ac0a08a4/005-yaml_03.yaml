observations:
  - task: 3c9b2e5b
  - general_rule: "Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid."
  - objects:
      - input_pixels: "Pixels in the input grid."
      - output_blocks: "2x2 blocks in the output grid, corresponding to each input pixel."
  - properties:
      - color: "The color value of a pixel (0-9)."
      - size: "Input grids are smaller than corresponding output grids."
      - scaling_factor: "Each dimension (height and width) of the input grid is multiplied by 2 to get the dimensions of the output grid."
  - actions:
      - expand: "Each input pixel is replicated to form a 2x2 block in the output grid."
      - preserve_color: "The color of the output block is the same as the input pixel."
