The input grid contains single-digit integers representing colors, while the output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input, with each non-zero pixel in the input replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color in the output. Zero-valued pixels in the input remain as blocks of zeros in the output, but simply expanding the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The top-left corner of this 2x2 block will be at coordinates (2 \\* row, 2 \\* column), where 'row' and 'column' are the row and column indices of the current pixel in the input grid.\n    * if the pixel value is zero:\n        * the zeros in the output grid have already been initialized.\n\nEffectively, each non zero pixel in the input grid \"expands\" into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid. Zero values expands too.\n"
