Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller input grid (3x3) into a larger output grid. The input grids contain single, non-zero colored pixels scattered within a background of white (0) pixels. The output grids appear to be an expansion of these non-zero pixels into square blocks of the same color. The size of these blocks and the dimensions of the overall output grid seem related to the input grid size and number of colored pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      pixels:
        type: integer
        values: [0-9]
        meaning: color
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0-9]
      position:
        type: coordinates
        x: [0-2] #for 3x3 input grid
        y: [0-2] #for 3x3 input grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: non-zero pixels
    properties:
      size: 3x3 (seems to be a consistent expansion)
      result: create a contiguous block of identical color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: each non-zero input pixel maps to a non-overlapping 3x3 block in the output.
  - type: dimensional
    relation: input is 3x3, and outputs are multiples of 3, i.e., multiples of the input size

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero pixels (colored pixels) in the input grid.
2.  **For each** non-zero pixel:
    *   Create a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid, all having the same color as the identified input pixel.
    *   The top-left corner of each 3x3 block is determined by its position in the original grid, multiplied out by the input dimensions.
3.  **Combine** these 3x3 blocks to form the final output grid. The output grid dimensions are determined by multiplying the input dimensions by the expansion factor of 3. The arrangement of the 3x3 colored blocks replicates the non-zero pixel locations from the input grid, scaled up.
4. All other cells in the output will have color 0.

Essentially the output is made by creating a 3x3 block for each non zero pixel
of the same color, and arranging these blocks in the same layout as the input.

The size of the output grid is the number of rows/columns of non-zero pixels x 3.

The size of the blocks depends on the number of the colored pixels.
