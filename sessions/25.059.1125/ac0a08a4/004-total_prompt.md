Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The input grid contains single-digit integers representing colors, while the output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input, with each non-zero pixel in the input replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color in the output. Zero-valued pixels in the input remain as blocks of zeros in the output, but simply expanding the grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: Output is a 6x6 grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - object: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Represented by the integer value (e.g., 2 for red, 7 for orange).
    action: Replicated as a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  - object: Zero pixels in input grid.
     properties:
        color: Represented by integer value 0 (white)
     action: Expand into regions of 0s in output.
  - relationship: The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (2x scaling).
  - relationship:  Non-zero input pixel at (i, j) maps to a 2x2 block in the output at (2i, 2j), (2i+1, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j+1).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with dimensions double that of the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid.
3.  **Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel value is non-zero:
        *   Copy the pixel's value to a 2x2 block of cells in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 2x2 block will be at coordinates (2 \* row, 2 \* column), where 'row' and 'column' are the row and column indices of the current pixel in the input grid.
    * if the pixel value is zero:
        * the zeros in the output grid have already been initialized.

Effectively, each non zero pixel in the input grid "expands" into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid. Zero values expands too.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
