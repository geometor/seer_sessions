objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      pixels:
        type: integer
        values: [0-9]
        meaning: color
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0-9]
      position:
        type: coordinates
        x: [0-2] #for 3x3 input grid
        y: [0-2] #for 3x3 input grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: non-zero pixels
    properties:
      size: 3x3 (seems to be a consistent expansion)
      result: create a contiguous block of identical color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: each non-zero input pixel maps to a non-overlapping 3x3 block in the output.
  - type: dimensional
    relation: input is 3x3, and outputs are multiples of 3, i.e., multiples of the input size
