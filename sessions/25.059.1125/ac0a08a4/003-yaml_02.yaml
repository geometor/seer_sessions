facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - observation: Output is a 6x6 grid of single-digit integers (0-9).
  - object: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Represented by the integer value (e.g., 2 for red, 7 for orange).
    action: Replicated as a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  - object: Zero pixels in input grid.
     properties:
        color: Represented by integer value 0 (white)
     action: Expand into regions of 0s in output.
  - relationship: The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (2x scaling).
  - relationship:  Non-zero input pixel at (i, j) maps to a 2x2 block in the output at (2i, 2j), (2i+1, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j+1).
