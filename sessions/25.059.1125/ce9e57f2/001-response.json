The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a change in color of some of the red pixels, specifically those at the bottom of vertical red lines. It looks like the transformation \"fills\" color azure (8) starting from the bottom of each \"column\" or vertical stack of red (2) pixels, up to a specific height, possibly where the consecutive chain of red pixels ends.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
