Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of red (2) pixels with azure (8) pixels based on their position. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      cells: pixels
      colors: [white, red, azure]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    properties:
      source_color: red (2)
      target_color: azure (8)
      condition: specific columns and rows

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
  - type: positional
    description: color replacement based on row and column index.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each red pixel, check its position (row and column index):
    *   If the red pixel is located below other red pixels in a contiguous vertical line, replace the red pixel with an azure (8) pixel.
    * if not, retain red

3.  **Output:** Generate the output grid with the replaced pixels, keeping all other pixels unchanged.
