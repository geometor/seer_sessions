Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially with values of 0 (white) and 2 (red). The transformation changes some of the 2 (red) pixels to 8 (azure). The change seems to be related to the vertical position of the red pixels. The background of 0 (white) pixels stays the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
        - azure (8)
      position:
        - row
        - column
actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    parameters:
      from_color: 2
      to_color: 8
    preconditions:
      - object.color == 2
      - object.position.row >= some_threshold # to be determined
    postconditions:
      - object.color == 8
relationships:
  - type: vertical_position
    relation: determines color change

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels with the color red (value 2).
2.  **Conditional Change**: Starting from the bottom row, examine the existing red vertical pattern. If a red pixel is on or below row 5, it will change to azure.
3.  **Transform:** Change the color of the red pixels in rows 5, 6, and 7, to azure (value 8). All other pixels retain their original color.

Essentially, the lowest three rows of red pixels will change color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
