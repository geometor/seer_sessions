objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        2: red
        4: yellow
      position: (row, column)
  - type: shape
    properties:
      name: rectangle
      corners:
          - pixel1: yellow
            position: (3,3)
          - pixel2: yellow
            position: (3,5)
          - pixel3: yellow
            position: (5,3)
          - pixel4: yellow
            position: (5,5)
actions:
    - Find the set of pixels with the value of 4
    - Define a rectangle using these pixels as opposite corners/vertices.
    - find_center:
        input: rectangle corner coordinates
        output: center coordinate
    - change_color:
        input: pixel at center coordinate, new color (2)
        output: modified grid

relationships:
  -  The red pixel in output is the geometric center of the implied rectangle whose corners are formed by the yellow pixels.
