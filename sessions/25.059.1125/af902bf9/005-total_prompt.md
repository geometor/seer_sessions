Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Corner Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '4' (yellow) in the input grid.
2.  **Form Rectangle:** Consider these yellow pixels as defining the opposite corners of an implied rectangle.
3.  **Calculate Center:** Determine the center point of this rectangle. The center's row is the average of the yellow pixels rows, and its columns are the average of the yellow pixels' columns.
4.  **Add center object:** Add a red pixel (value '2') to the output at a position determined by the calculated center point.
5.  **Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid, with the addition of the red center pixel.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
