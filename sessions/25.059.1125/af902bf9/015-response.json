The primary colors involved are yellow (4), white (0), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of white (0) pixels with red (2) pixels based on the positions of yellow (4) pixels. It seems to be about creating areas.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These act as anchor points for the transformation.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Conditional):** If a yellow pixel in first half rows and has an adjacent yellow pixel on either side (left and right), a red pixel is placed on top of the 0 in between.\n\n3.  **Vertical Expansion (Conditional):** If a yellow pixel is in the second half of rows and has and adjacent yellow pixel below, create a 2x4 red area in between the yellow pixels.\n\nIn summary the input yellow pixels create a red area below or above based on their vertical position in the grid and spatial relationship with each other.\n"
