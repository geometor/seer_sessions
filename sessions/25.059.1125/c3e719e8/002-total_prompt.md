**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements appear to be:

*   **Input Grids:** Small 3x3 grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a distinct color.
*   **Output Grids:** Larger 9x9 grids. They seem to be related to the input grids through replication and placement, with the addition of '0' (white) as a filler. There's an apparent rotational or mirroring aspect.
*    There are three distinct 3x3 regions in each of the output grids
*    The filling with '0' (white) forms a distinct "plus" shape that separates the non-zero input patterns

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_coded: true

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_coded: true
      - contains_input_grid: true

  - relation: replication
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is replicated in the output grid.
    
  - relation: filling
    subject: output_grid
    value: 0
    description: regions not occupied by replication are filled with 0

  - action: arrangement
    agent: replication
    description: copies of input arranged within a defined region to create sub regions in output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replication:** The 3x3 input grid is replicated four times.
2.  **Arrangement (Cross Pattern):**
      *   One copy of the input grid is place in the top-left 3x3 region of the output.
     *  One copy of the input grid is placed in the top-right 3 x 3 region of the output.
    *   One copy of the input grid is placed in the bottom-left 3x3 region of the output.
    *  One copy of the input grid is placed in the bottom right 3x3 region of the output.
3.  **Filling:** All remaining cells in the 9x9 output grid that are not part of a replication, are filled with the value '0'.

Essentially, the input grid is copied into a larger 9x9 grid in all four "corners", forming a 3-region layout. The output's filled '0' creates a plus-shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
