The original 3x3 input grid appears to be replicated and embedded within the larger grid, with strategic positioning and surrounding '0' (white) pixels. Specifically, there appears to be a direct copy of the input within the output, and then there is the input grid replicated to its right, and replicated below itself. There also appears to be the input replicated below and to the right of itself, creating a 3x3 matrix of the original grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
