The smaller grid appears to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern within the larger grid. The colors/values in the original 3x3 grid are preserved in the larger grid. The rest of the larger grid is filled with zeros (white color). The replication pattern seems to involve a combination of repetition and spatial arrangement.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
