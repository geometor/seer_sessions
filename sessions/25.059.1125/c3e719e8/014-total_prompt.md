Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is replicated four times in a 2x2 pattern within a larger 9x9 output grid. The remaining cells of the output grid are filled with 0s.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize a 9x9 output grid with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=int)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Copy the input grid to the top-left corner
    output_grid[:input_height, :input_width] = input_grid

    # Copy the input grid to the top-right corner
    output_grid[:input_height, 6:9] = input_grid

    # Copy the input grid to the bottom-left corner
    output_grid[6:9, :input_width] = input_grid
    
    # Copy the input grid to the bottom-right corner
    output_grid[6:9, 6:9] = input_grid

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved replicating the input grid four times in a 2x2 pattern within a 9x9 output grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this pattern doesn't hold universally. The size of the output grid and the placement of the replicated input grids vary. We need to shift from a fixed 9x9 output grid and predetermined replication positions to a more dynamic approach that accounts for the input grid's dimensions and potentially different replication patterns. The core concept of replication seems correct, but the specifics of *how* and *where* to replicate need refinement.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Dimensions:** Carefully examine the input and output grid dimensions for each example. Use this to understand how the output grid size relates to the input grid size.
2.  **Identify Replication Pattern:** Determine if the input grid is consistently replicated four times (2x2). If not, identify the actual replication pattern.
3.  **Relative Positioning:** Instead of hardcoding positions (like 6:9), determine the positioning of replicated grids *relative* to the input grid's dimensions and possibly some consistent spacing or padding.
4.  **Object Recognition**: Identify how the colors are placed relative to each other

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting dimensions, replication, and discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 9x9
    *   Replication: 2x2 (four times)
    *   Result: Pass
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 2x2
    *   Output: 6x6
    *   Replication: 2x2 (four times)
    *   Result: Fail. The current code produces a 9x9 output. should be 6x6. copies are placed incorrectly at 6, should be 4
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 1x1
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Replication: 2x2 (four times)
    *    Result: Fail. The current code produces a 9x9 output, should be 3x3

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is replicated to create a larger output grid.
  - observation: |
      The replication occurs in a 2x2 pattern, creating four copies of the input.
  - property: output_grid_size
    description: The output grid dimensions are related to the input dimensions.
    calculation: Output dimension = Input dimension * 3
  - action: replicate_input
    description: The input grid is replicated four times.
  - action: position_replicas
    description: Replicas are placed in a 2x2 grid arrangement within the output.
  - observation: |
      There are no additional objects or colors introduced; only replications of the input.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid's dimensions are three times the input grid's dimensions (both height and width).
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid filled with zeros, with the calculated dimensions.
3.  **Replicate Input:** Create four copies of the input grid.
4.  **Place Replicas:** Position the four copies of the input grid within the output grid in a 2x2 arrangement:
    *   Top-Left: Starting at (0, 0).
    *   Top-Right: Starting at (0, input\_width \* 2).
    *   Bottom-Left: Starting at (input\_height \* 2, 0).
    *   Bottom-Right: Starting at (input\_height \* 2, input\_width \* 2).

This revised natural language program addresses the dynamic output size and relative positioning of the replicated grids, generalizing the transformation rule beyond the initial 9x9 assumption.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
