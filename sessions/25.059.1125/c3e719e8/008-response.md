The input grid is replicated to form the output grid. The replication factor is 3, meaning both the width and height of the input grid are multiplied by 3 to determine the dimensions of the output grid. The original input grid is tiled across the output grid. Any remaining cells in the output grid, not filled by the replicated input, are filled with the background color, white (0).
