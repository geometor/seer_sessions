observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: derived from input_grid (2 * input_rows + row_gap)
      cols: derived from input_grid (2 * input_cols + col_gap)
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      description: Contains four replicas of the input_grid in a 2x2 arrangement.
  - object: row_gap
    type: integer
    properties:
       derivation: (output_rows - 2 * input_rows)+1
       purpose: space between rows
  - object: col_gap
       type: integer
       properties:
          derivation: (output_cols - 2 * input_cols) + 1
          purpose: space between columns
  - action: replication
    description: The input_grid is replicated four times.
  - action: arrangement
    description: The replicas are arranged in a 2x2 matrix.
  - action: spacing
    description: The spacing between the replicas is dynamically calculated using row_gap and col_gap
  - action: filling
    description: The remaining area in output_grid is filled with white (0).
