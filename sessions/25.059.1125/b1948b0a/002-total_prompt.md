**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids of single-digit integers.  Each integer represents a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.  The transformation appears to involve a color substitution, specifically changing some instances of '6' (magenta) to '2' (red), while leaving '7' (orange) unchanged. The key seems to be the *location* of the '6's.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: |
      Pixels with value '6' (magenta).
  - object: |
      Pixels with value '7' (orange).
  - action: |
      Some '6' pixels are replaced with '2' (red).
  - action: |
      '7' pixels are never changed.
  - relationship: |
      The spatial position of '6' pixels determines if they are changed to '2'.
  - context:
      Only uses number and basic geometry and topology priors
      Colors: 6 is magenta, 7 is orange and 2 is red.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the pixel's value:
    *   If the pixel's value is '7', keep the value the same in the output grid.
    *   If the pixel's value is '6', change the value of that pixel to '2' in the output grid.

Essentially the rule can be summarized as: "Replace all instances of '6' with '2'. Leave '7' unchanged."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
