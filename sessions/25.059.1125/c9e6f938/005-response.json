            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track, focusing on horizontal duplication and manipulation of orange pixels. However, the code incorrectly interpreted \"extend to the right\" instruction and the condition for extension. It seems to modify only the `i+1` row, not the adjacent pixel in the same row and incorrectly checks for white. By examining all the training examples and the results, it's clear the extension rule is more precise: orange (7) regions in the original input's *reflection* are extended to the right until a white (0) pixel or edge is encountered *in the reflection*. The implementation also attempts to access out of bounds, and is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct the \"extension\" logic**: The code needs to extend orange pixels *horizontally* to the right, within the duplicated section.\n2.  **Bounding Condition**: stop when it encounters a white or the edge, not just check for orange.\n3. **Precise Reflection Handling**: Explicitly identify that we are working on reflection area and only the reflection area.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant aspects:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Small grid with a single orange pixel.\n    *   Output: Orange pixel extended to the right in the duplicated section until edge.\n    *   Result: Pass\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Orange region bounded by white on the right.\n    *   Output: Orange extension stops at white in the duplicated section.\n    *   Result: Fail. Current code doesn't stop at the white cell, it makes wrong cells orange.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: No orange pixels.\n    *   Output: Simple horizontal duplication.\n    *   Result: Pass\n* **Example 4:**\n     * Input: Orange region present.\n     * Output: Orange region extended only in the duplicated area.\n     * Result: Fail, same error mechanism as Example 2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 08ed6ac7\nfacts:\n  objects:\n    - type: grid\n      properties:\n        - colors: [0, 7] # white, orange\n        - height: variable\n        - width: variable\n    - type: region\n      properties:\n       - color: 7 #orange\n       - contiguous: true #connected pixels of the same color\n\n  actions:\n    - name: duplicate\n      description: The input grid is duplicated horizontally.\n      agent: system\n      target: grid\n\n    - name: extend_orange\n      description: Orange regions present in the original image, are extended\n        to the right, in the reflected section only.\n      agent: system\n      target: orange region\n      condition: \"Extend until a white (0) pixel or the right edge of the\n        duplicated grid is encountered, within the duplicated half.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Duplicate:** Create a new grid by duplicating the input grid horizontally.\n2.  **Identify Orange:** In the *original* half of the grid (left side), identify contiguous regions of orange (7) pixels.\n3. **Reflect and Extend:** For each orange region identified:\n    *   In the *duplicated* half of the grid (right side), find the area that mirrors the orange region of the left side.\n    *    Extend the orange color horizontally to the right, starting from the initial mirrored position.\n    *   Stop the extension when a white (0) pixel or the right edge of the grid is encountered.\n\n"
