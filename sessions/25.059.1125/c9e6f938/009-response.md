Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0) and orange (7). The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 3x6. The transformation seems to involve expanding the orange pixels horizontally.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3, output grid is 3x6.
  - observation: Input contains two orange (7) pixels adjacent horizontally.
  - observation: Output contains four orange (7) pixels, extending the original two horizontally.
  - observation: White (0) pixels remain white (0).
  - object: orange_pixels
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      initial_count: 2
      final_count: 4
      shape: initially two adjacent squares, expands to four.
    actions:
      - expand_horizontally
  - object: white_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    actions:
      - remain_unchanged
  - relationship: Orange pixels are expanded such that original pixels exist in expanded region
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Double** the width of the input grid from 3 to 6 columns, only if the input is 3x3
3.  **For each contiguous block of orange pixels**, duplicate that horizontal block by extending it to the right one time.
4.  **All other** pixels remain unchanged (white stays white).

In simpler terms, the transformation horizontally duplicates each contiguous horizontal block of orange pixels, doubling their width, in a new grid that's double width.
