Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0) and orange (7). The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. The key change seems to be the replication of the orange pixel and an expansion of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (representing colors)
      - initial_size: 3x3
      - final_size: 3x6
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
      - value: 0
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: orange
      - value: 7
    actions:
      - name: replicate_orange
        details: "The orange pixel is duplicated at the opposite end of the row."
      - name: expand_grid
        details: "The grid's width is doubled."
  - relationships:
        - type: spatial
          description: The position of the original orange pixel and its replica.
          details: Original and replicated pixel are mirrored in the row.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the orange pixel:** Locate the pixel with a value of 7 (orange) in the input grid.
2.  **Double the grid width:** Create a new grid with the same height as the original, but twice the width.
3. **Copy the orange:** In the same row where the orange pixel was original, in the new grid, set the corresponding column in the new grid to be 7.
4.  **Mirror the orange pixel:** In the expanded grid, place another orange pixel (7) at the opposite end of the row containing the original orange pixel. Specifically, if the original orange pixel is at `(row, col)`, the new orange pixel will be at `(row, new_width - 1 - col)`.
5.  **Fill remaining cells:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (0).
