It appears the original grid has been horizontally duplicated, and certain elements are modified in the duplicate.\n*   **Colors:** The primary colors are white (0) and orange (7).  The transformation seems to primarily involve manipulating the orange (7) pixels.\n*   **Shape Modification**: It seems that a rectangular shape made of orange(7) is being stretched and mirrored in some way.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
