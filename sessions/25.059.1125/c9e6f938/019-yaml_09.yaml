facts:
  - task: "Mirror and Fill"
  - input_objects:
    - object_1: "orange pixel(s) with value 7"
    - object_2: "Pixels of any value between 0-9"
  - input_properties:
    - property_1: "input grid of variable size (height x width)"
  - output_objects:
    - object_1: "orange pixel(s), possibly mirrored"
    - object_2: "Pixels copied from input and extended"
  - output_properties:
    - property_1: "output grid wider than input, calculated based on position of orange pixel"
  - transformations:
    - transformation_1: "Locate orange pixel in the input."
    - transformation_2: "Calculate extension amount: input_width - 1 - orange_pixel_column"
    - transformation_3: "Create a new grid with width = input_width + 2*extension and a determined height"
    - transformation_4: "Copy the orange pixel to output grid"
    - transformation_5: "Place a mirrored orange pixel at calculated location"
    - transformation_6: "Copy and extend the remainder of pixels from the input to the output"
