      notes: "The code incorrectly identified many small rectangles within the larger blue rectangle and red region. It should only identify 1 rectangle with a hole."

      input_objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: blue
          bounding_box:  [[2, 2], [4, 4]]

      notes: "Similar to example 0, the code over-counts rectangles."

      output: 0
      correct: True
      predicted: 0
      notes: "Correctly identifies no hole."

      notes: "Correctly identifies no hole."

general_rule: "Count the number of rectangles that have a different colored region inside them.  A rectangle is a solid, contiguous block of pixels of the same color. A hole is a contiguous region of different color pixels completely enclosed by the rectangle."
