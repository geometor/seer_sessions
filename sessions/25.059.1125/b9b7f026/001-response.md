Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task. Here's my breakdown of the provided examples:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (input) and single digits (output). The input grids contain various colored rectangular objects, with 0 (white) representing the background. The output appears to be a single digit, possibly corresponding to one of the colored objects within the input grid. The key seems to be identifying a specific colored rectangle and then outputting its color value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_type: object_selection
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      - size: variable
      - position: variable
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: white
      - size: entire_grid

actions:
  - type: identify_largest_rectangle
  - type: select_rectangle_by_color
  - type: find_inner_rectangle
  - type: get_rectangle_color
relationships:
  - rectangles: contain_other_rectangles

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Examine the input grid and identify all distinct rectangular shapes formed by contiguous pixels of the same color.
2.  **Find "Inside" Rectangle** If a rectangle fully encloses the non-zero pixels of one and only one other rectangle, select the inside rectangle.
3.  **Output Color:** Output the color code (single digit integer) of that inside rectangle.

The core idea is focusing on a unique enclosed rectangle and reporting its color value.
