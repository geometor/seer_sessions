**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 4 0
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7F4C2318BD50>

**output:**
```
0 0 4
0 2 2
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7F4C1A58B950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a rotation operation. The colors (represented by numbers) remain the same, but their positions within the grid change. Specifically, it looks like a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The bottom row remains unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    description: Contains colored pixels represented by integers.
  - property: color
    values: [0, 2, 4, 8] # white, red, yellow, azure
    description: Represents the color of a pixel.
  - operation: rotation
    type: clockwise
    degrees: 90
    description: The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
  - observation:
      description: the last row in the input is identical to the last row in the output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  **Output:** The rotated 3x3 grid.
    The program copies the last row of the input. It rotates the remainder of the grid (first two rows, by transposing and mirroring each sub-row, from left-right to top-down), so the rotated segment is correctly situated *above* the unchanged last row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
