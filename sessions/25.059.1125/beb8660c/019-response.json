            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for refining the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved a 90-degree clockwise rotation and the addition of an azure diagonal line. However, subsequent tests revealed that this program doesn't hold for all examples. Specifically, while the rotation seems correct in some cases, the diagonal line is not always present, and its color might also change. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example, assuming a rule (the diagonal line) that isn't universally applicable.\n\nThe strategy should involve:\n\n1.  **Verifying Rotation:** Confirm if the 90-degree clockwise rotation is consistent across all examples.\n2.  **Re-evaluating the Diagonal:** Determine if the diagonal line is a consistent feature or a distraction. If it exists, we need to analyze its properties (color, position) more carefully.\n3.  **Object Identification:** Examine the examples more closely to look for consistent patterns in the transformation beyond the rotation.\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** Consider the possibility of conditional operations - actions performed only if specific conditions are met.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll use code execution and visual inspection of the provided images (from the previous turns) to derive detailed observations. I will focus on properties that are consistent across all three examples.\nSince I am a language model, I cannot inspect images. Thus, I will report metrics about rotation.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grids(input_grid, output_grid, rotated_input_grid):\n    input_array = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_array = np.array(output_grid)\n    rotated_input_array = np.array(rotated_input_grid)\n\n    results = {\n        'input_shape': input_array.shape,\n        'output_shape': output_array.shape,\n        'rotated_input_shape': rotated_input_array.shape,\n      }\n    return results\n\n# Data from the previous turn.\nexamples = [\n  {\n      \"input\": [\n          [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8],\n          [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8],\n      ],\n      \"output\": [\n          [6, 6],\n          [8, 8],\n          [6, 6],\n          [8, 8],\n          [6, 6],\n          [8, 8],\n          [6, 6],\n          [8, 8],\n      ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": [\n      [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n      [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n      [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n    ],\n      \"output\": [\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5],\n       [5, 5, 5]\n      ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"input\": [\n      [6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8],\n      [6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8],\n      [6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8],\n    ],\n    \"output\": [\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8],\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nall_results = []\nfor example in examples:\n  rotated_input = np.rot90(np.array(example['input']), k=-1).tolist()  # Rotate input\n  results = describe_grids(example['input'], example['output'], rotated_input)\n  all_results.append(results)\n\nprint(all_results)\n```"
