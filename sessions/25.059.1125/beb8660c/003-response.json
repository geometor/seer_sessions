The positions and potentially the order of these bars seem to be the key transformation. The background is white (0). The bars appear to be solid, meaning there aren't gaps of other colors within a single-colored bar.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

A horizontal bar is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (excluding 0/white, which serves as a background color), extending across one or more columns within a single row.\n\n2.  **Record Properties:** For each identified bar, record its color, length, and starting row position.\n\n3. **Determine New Row Order:**\n\n    *   Sort the list of identified bars, by their starting row position in the input grid.\n    *   Assign a new row position to each bar, starting from the bottom of the output grid.\n\n4. **Construct Output Grid:**\n\n    *   Create new empty grid with the same size, fill with background (value 0).\n    *   Iterate each bar, write on the new output rows.\n\n5.  **Transpose bars**: Rotate or flip the bars to the bottom\n\nEssentially, the transformation rearranges the horizontal bars, placing them at the bottom of the grid in the order they appeared from top to bottom in the input grid.\n"
