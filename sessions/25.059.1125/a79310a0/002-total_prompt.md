**Perception:**

The core transformation seems to involve a color change and a positional shift. Specifically, azure (8) regions in the input are replaced with red (2) regions in the output. The position of red object in output relates to position of the azure object in input. The red object appears to "lag" the azure object.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain objects of color azure (8) and white (0).
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain objects of color red (2) and white (0).
  - transformation: |
      The azure object in the input is transformed into the red object.
  - transformation: |
     The size and shape of azure object is preserved in transformation to
     red object.
  - position: |
     The row index of red colored object in the output grid seems to be related to the
     row index of the azure object + 1.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Shape and size:** For each azure object found, copy it's shape and size
    to output.
3.  **Translate Downward:** Shift red object by adding 1 to the y-coordinate (row
    index) of each pixel.
4.  **Recolor:** Change the color of copied object to red (2).
5. **Leave other pixels white.**


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
