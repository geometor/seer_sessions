Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on modifying diagonals, specifically changing every other non-zero pixel to yellow (4) along diagonals running in both directions (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left). The results across the training examples show inconsistencies. While it works for the first example, it fails on others. This suggests the rule is either incomplete or incorrect. The core issue seems to be an over-generalization from a single example. The diagonal modification might be a part of the solution but its conditional execution is what's lacking. We need to identify properties of diagonals, positions, or colors.

My strategy is:

1.  **Detailed Analysis:** Examine each input/output pair closely, noting where the code's output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the discrepancies, adjust the hypothesis about *when* the diagonal modification should occur. It's likely not *all* diagonals, but only specific ones based on certain criteria.
3.  **Object Properties:** Pay close attention to the properties of the objects (contiguous blocks of color), their positions, sizes, and surrounding pixels.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** Develop a refined natural language program that includes conditional statements (if-then) to control the diagonal modification.
5.  **YAML Documentation:** Summarize the objects, properties, and actions in a structured YAML format.
6.  **Natural Language Program:** Express the complete transformation rule in plain, concise language, easy to translate to code.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution where needed)**

I will generate observations on the supplied examples, and then refine them to the most accurate and useful form for creating a natural language program.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
