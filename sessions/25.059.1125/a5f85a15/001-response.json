The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Pixels:** Individual cells within the grids, represented by single-digit integers (0-9) corresponding to colors.\n*   **Grids:** 2D arrays of pixels. Input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   **Colors:** Specific colors are significant (red, maroon, green, yellow, white). White (0) seems to act as a background or empty space.\n*   **Diagonal Pattern**: Non-zero colored pixels in the input grids appear to form a diagonal line. There exist multiple diagonal lines in certain test cases.\n*\t**Alternating yellow**: The color yellow (4) appears in the locations of, every other colored pixel along the diagonals\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
