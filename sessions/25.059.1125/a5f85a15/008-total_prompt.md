**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the first example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains the numbers 2 and 0, representing red and white pixels, respectively. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except the center pixel, which is '0' (white) in the input and '4' (yellow) in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids are 3x3."
  - input_grid:
      size: "3x3"
      elements:
        - color: "red (2)"
          positions: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
        - color: "white (0)"
          positions: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1]]
  - output_grid:
      size: "3x3"
      elements:
        - color: "red (2)"
          positions: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]]
        - color: "white (0)"
          positions: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
        - color: "yellow (4)"
          positions: [[1,1]]
  - transformation:
      - action: "Change color of center pixel."
        from: "white (0)"
        to: "yellow (4)"
  - objects:
    - description: diagonal from top-left to bottom-right of red pixels
    - description: center pixel

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the center pixel of the input grid.
2.  If the center pixel is white (0), change it to yellow (4).
3.  Leave all other pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
