1. Identify the Grid: The input is a grid of pixels, each with a specific color.
2. Locate the Center: Determine the center pixel of the grid. The center pixel's row index is the number of rows divided by two (integer division). The Center pixel's col index is the number of cols divided by 2 (integer division).
3. Change Color: Change the color of the center pixel to yellow (4).
4. Preserve Other Pixels: All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.
