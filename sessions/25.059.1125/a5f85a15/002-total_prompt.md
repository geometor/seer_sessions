**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids into output grids. The primary elements are:

*   **Pixels:** Individual cells within the grids, represented by single-digit integers (0-9) corresponding to colors.
*   **Grids:** 2D arrays of pixels. Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   **Colors:** Specific colors are significant (red, maroon, green, yellow, white). White (0) seems to act as a background or empty space.
*   **Diagonal Pattern**: Non-zero colored pixels in the input grids appear to form a diagonal line. There exist multiple diagonal lines in certain test cases.
*	**Alternating yellow**: The color yellow (4) appears in the locations of, every other colored pixel along the diagonals

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (height, width)
      - pixels: list of pixels
  - observation:
      - description: "Non-zero pixels in input form diagonal lines."
  - observation:
      - description: "Every other non zero value in the diagonal is changed to 4 (yellow) in output"
  - observation:
      - description: Input and output grids have the same shape.
  - action:
      - description: "Replace, every other non-zero pixel with 4(yellow) along the diagonal"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Diagonals:** Locate all diagonal lines of non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Iterate through diagonals**. For each diagonal.
3.  **Alternate Colors:** Traverse each diagonal and change the color of every other non zero pixel.
4. If a colored pixel is changed, set it to 4 (yellow).
5. Preserve the rest.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
