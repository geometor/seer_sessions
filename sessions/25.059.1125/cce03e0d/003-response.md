Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing digits 0, 1, and 2. These correspond to colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 2 (red).
*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid. The original 3x3 input grid appears to be replicated and placed in the top-left corner of a larger, mostly empty (all 0/white) 9x9 grid.

**YAML Block: Facts**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1, 2]  # representing colors
    properties:
      - color_map: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red}

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: [0, 1, 2]
    properties:
      - color_map: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red}

actions:
  - name: replicate_and_embed
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The input grid is placed within a larger output grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The input grid becomes a sub-grid within the output grid, positioned at the top-left.
  - type: dimensional
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: output grid is 3x the size (both width and height) of input grid.
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Create an empty 9x9 grid:** Initialize a new 9x9 grid filled entirely with 0s (representing white).
2.  **Copy the input grid:** Take the original 3x3 input grid.
3.  **Embed the input:** Place the copied 3x3 input grid into the top-left corner of the 9x9 grid, starting at position (0, 0). The values from the input grid overwrite the 0s in the corresponding cells of the 9x9 grid.

Essentially, the transformation expands the canvas to a 9x9 grid and places the original 3x3 input at the top-left.
