facts:
  - description: "The input grid is treated as a single object."
  - property: input_size
    values: "Variable (e.g., 3x3, 1x1, 2x2)"
  - property: output_size
    values: "Variable, appears to be 3 times the input size (3x)"
  - action: replication
    description: "The input grid is replicated multiple times within the output grid."
  - action: placement
    description: "The placement of replications varies but seems related to the dimensions of input and output"
  - observation: "The output grid is always square, output_width == output_height."
  - observation: "The output dimensions appear to always be input dimensions * 3"
