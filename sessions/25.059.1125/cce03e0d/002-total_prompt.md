**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 3x3 grid (input) into a larger 9x9 grid (output). The input grids contain single-digit integers (0-2) representing different colors. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern of replication and placement of the input grid's elements. The '0' pixels in the input appear to act as a background or filler. The core transformation appears to involve repositioning and potentially replicating the non-zero elements of the input grid within a larger, mostly empty, 9x9 output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-2)
    properties:
      - color_coded: True
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-2)
    properties:
      - color_coded: True
      - mostly_empty: True # Most cells are 0

actions:
  - name: expand
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms the 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid.
  - name: replicate_and_position
    input: non-zero elements of input_grid
    description:  Places the non-zero elements of the input grid into specific locations within the output grid, potentially with replication.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: The output grid is a patterned expansion of the input grid.
  - element_placement: Non-zero elements from the input_grid maintain their values in the output_grid, but their positions change according to a specific rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with 0s.

2. **Input Grid Scan:** Iterate through each cell of the 3x3 input grid.

3. **Conditional Placement:** For each non-zero element in the input grid:
    *   Determine its row (r) and column (c) coordinates within the input grid (0-indexed).
    *  Place the same non zero element value into the 9x9 output_grid, at coordinates derived using below formula:
    * output_row = r + (0 * 3), output_col = c + (0 * 3)
    * output_row = r + (0 * 3), output_col = c + (2 * 3)
    * output_row = r + (2* 3), output_col = c + (0 * 3)
    * output_row = r + (2 * 3), output_col = c + (2 * 3)

4. **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the output. It seems the original non-zero pixels are arranged on opposite corners, with 2 repetitions for each 3x3 sub-grid.

In summary, the transformation replicates the input grid's non-zero elements, placing each original color pixel into the top-left and bottom-right 3x3 quadrants of the larger output grid. The placement in the expanded grid directly related to the original position, maintaining the initial local structure. The zero values seem to serve as a background color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
