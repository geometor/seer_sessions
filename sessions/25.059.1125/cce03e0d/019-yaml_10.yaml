task: 93b581b8
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    attributes:
      shape: variable
      content: integer values representing colors
    operations:
      replicated: |
        The input grid is replicated to create the output grid.
        The replication factor is determined by comparing the input and output grid dimensions.
        Replication can be horizontal, vertical or both (2x2).
  - object: output_grid
    attributes:
        shape: derived from input_grid shape
        content: contains replicated copies of the input_grid
