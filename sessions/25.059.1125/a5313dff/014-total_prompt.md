Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved filling a closed red shape with blue. The provided results show that this approach doesn't generalize perfectly to all cases. Some shapes have interior pixels that are not 0. There's an issue with some shapes not getting filled.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output/predicted output triplet. Identify discrepancies between the expected output and the predicted output. Determine the nature of the errors.
2.  **Refine the `is_closed` function:**. The current implementation relies on detecting connections to the border. Look for scenarios where the shape might be considered "closed" by a human but not by the current algorithm.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the error analysis, update the natural language program to correctly describe the transformation rule that applies to *all* training examples.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Reports**

I don't have the ability to directly execute code. However, I'll outline the metrics I would *want* to gather, and I will make educated guesses about the results based on the images provided, pretending I've run code. I will provide "pseudo-code" comments to show how I would *ideally* get these metrics if I were in an environment with execution capabilities.

```
# Pseudo-code - I would use numpy and image processing libraries to get these metrics if possible

# Example 1:
# input_grid_1 = ... (load the input grid)
# output_grid_1 = ... (load the output grid)
# predicted_output_1 = transform(input_grid_1)
#
# correct_1 = np.array_equal(output_grid_1, predicted_output_1)
# print(f"Example 1 Correct: {correct_1}")
# # Examine the differences visually (if possible)

# Example 2:
# input_grid_2 = ...
# output_grid_2 = ...
# predicted_output_2 = transform(input_grid_2)
# correct_2 = np.array_equal(output_grid_2, predicted_output_2)
# print(f"Example 2 Correct: {correct_2}")

# Example 3:
# input_grid_3 = ...
# output_grid_3 = ...
# predicted_output_3 = transform(input_grid_3)
# correct_3 = np.array_equal(output_grid_3, predicted_output_3)
# print(f"Example 3 Correct: {correct_3}")
```

Based on visual inspection, here's my assessment:

*   **Example 1:** Correct. (The prediction matches the output).
*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. The inner yellow pixel should have been turned to blue in the closed shape.
*   **Example 3:** Incorrect. There is a complex shape in the middle and it did not fill the entire space.

    transformations:

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Determine Closure:** For each red object, determine if it forms a closed shape. A shape is considered closed if its interior is completely surrounded by red pixels, such that there's no path from the inside of the shape to the outside (background - white pixels) without crossing a red pixel.
3. **Fill Interior:** If and only if a red object is deemed "closed", fill its entire interior with blue (1) pixels. The interior includes all non-red pixels that are completely enclosed by the red boundary.
4.  **Preserve Boundaries:** The red pixels forming the boundary of the shape should remain red.
5. **No other changes:** Pixels that are not part of the interior of a closed, red object should be unchanged.

The most important update from the previous version is the precise definition of "closed" and "interior," ensuring all internal pixels, regardless of their original color, are filled with blue. The addition of the `fill_interior` function ensures this behaviour, by setting non-red pixels enclosed by the shape as interior pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
