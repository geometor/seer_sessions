The primary colors involved are red (2), white (0), and blue (1). The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific shape formed by the red pixels and filling the interior of that shape with blue pixels while leaving the exterior unchanged. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The background is composed of white (0) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
