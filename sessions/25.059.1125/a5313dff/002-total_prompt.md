<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1920x1616 at 0x7F4C231AB350>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The transformation seems to focus on a specific shape formed by the red (2) pixels. Inside this shape, there are pixels that have their value changed.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: red_shape
    type: contiguous_region
    color: red (2)
    description: A closed shape or outline formed by red pixels.
  - object: enclosed_pixels
    type: pixels
    color: varies
    description: Pixels located inside the 'red_shape'. Their original values are not consistently the same.
  - action: color_change
    target: enclosed_pixels
    from: any
    to: blue (1)
    description: The color value of the enclosed pixels is changed to blue.
  - context: grid
    description: a 2d array
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Find the contiguous region of red (2) pixels that forms a closed outline or shape. It could resemble a square, a more complex polygon, or even a letter-like shape. It is important to know that there is a border around the edge of the grid made of zero.

2.  **Locate Enclosed Pixels:** Determine which pixels are located *inside* the closed red shape. These pixels can have different initial values, but this part of the input does not control the transformation.

3.  **Change Enclosed Pixel Colors:** Change the color value of all pixels found inside the red shape to blue (1). Pixels that compose the shape remain red.

In summary, the transformation identifies a closed shape defined by red pixels and changes the color of all pixels within that shape to blue, keeping the shape outline.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
