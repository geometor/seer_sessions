"""
1.  **Identify Contiguous Red Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.  Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify these regions.
2.  **Fill Interior:** For each identified red region, determine its interior. The interior consists of all non-red pixels that are completely enclosed by the red region.
3.  **Change Interior to Blue:** Change the color of all interior pixels within each red region to blue (value 1).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:**  All pixels outside the identified red regions, and the red pixels themselves, remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
