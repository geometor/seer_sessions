The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most frequent colors are grey (5) and white (0). There are also occurrences of blue (1), red (2), and green (3). The transformation seems to modify specific parts of the input grid based on certain patterns. The grey color (5) seems like a separator or background element with a patterned structure. Blue(1), Red(2) and Green(3) seem to be agents/inserts.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
