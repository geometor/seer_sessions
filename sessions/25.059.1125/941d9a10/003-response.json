Specifically, two solid horizontal gray lines and gray lines in columns 3 and 8 remain.\n2.  **Top Region**: The white (0) pixels in the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the input is colored blue(1).\n3. **Middle Region:** The white(0) pixels of the 3 x 3 sub-grid at input\\[5:8, 4:8] are colored red(2).\n4.  **Bottom Region**:The white (0) pixels in the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid of the input is colored green(3).\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves changing the color of certain white pixels in the corners based on location, while preserving the existing gray-colored pixels. The input seems to have been divided in 9 regions. Six of the regions remain unchanged, while three of them change.\n"
