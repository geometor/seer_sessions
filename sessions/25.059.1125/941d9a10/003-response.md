Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.
*   The number 5 (gray) appears to be a static, structural element.
*   Other colors (0/white, 1/blue, 2/red, 3/green) appear to be changing or being introduced.
*   There seems to be three groups of similar rows.
*   The central gray bars remains the same in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
        3: green
        5: gray
      location: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: change_color
    description: Some pixels change their color value based on their location and their original color.

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: The grid is divided into regions of similar color, and the central region with the gray color is maintained
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify static elements**: The gray (5) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. Specifically, two solid horizontal gray lines and gray lines in columns 3 and 8 remain.
2.  **Top Region**: The white (0) pixels in the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the input is colored blue(1).
3. **Middle Region:** The white(0) pixels of the 3 x 3 sub-grid at input\[5:8, 4:8] are colored red(2).
4.  **Bottom Region**:The white (0) pixels in the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid of the input is colored green(3).

In summary, the transformation involves changing the color of certain white pixels in the corners based on location, while preserving the existing gray-colored pixels. The input seems to have been divided in 9 regions. Six of the regions remain unchanged, while three of them change.
