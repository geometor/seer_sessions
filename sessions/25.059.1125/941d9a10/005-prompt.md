Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves changing the color of certain white pixels in the corners based on location, while preserving the existing gray-colored pixels. The input seems to have been divided in 9 regions. Six of the regions remain unchanged, while three of them change.
1.  **Identify static elements**: The gray (5) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. Specifically, two solid horizontal gray lines and gray lines in columns 3 and 8 remain.
2.  **Top Region**: The white (0) pixels in the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the input is colored blue(1).
3. **Middle Region:** The white(0) pixels of the 3 x 3 sub-grid at input[5:8, 4:8] are colored red(2).
4.  **Bottom Region**:The white (0) pixels in the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid of the input is colored green(3).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
