Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  **Initialization:** The input is an 8x8 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Identify target:** check for pixels in the 5th column that are yellow or red.
3. **Identify Changing Pixels**: Locate blue pixels to the left of the target, and change the blue pixels to the color of the pixel on the 5th column.
4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels retain their original color and position.
5. **Output Production:** The output is the modified 8x8 grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
