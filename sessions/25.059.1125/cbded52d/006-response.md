"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  **Initialization:** The input is an 8x8 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Identify Trigger Column:** The fourth column (index 3) is identified as the "trigger column".
3.  **Identify Target Column:** The fifth column (index 4) is the target column
4.  **Conditional Color Change:** *All* blue pixels (color 1) within the trigger column (index 3) are changed to match the color of the pixel directly to their right, in column 4 (index 4).
5.  **Preservation:** All other pixels retain their original color and position.
6.  **Output Production:** The output is the modified 8x8 grid.
