<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1664x1104 at 0x7F4C1B75CA50>Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The most prominent colors are blue (1), black (0), and some other colors that appear less frequently, acting as "markers". The overall structure is highly regular, with large areas of alternating blue and black pixels. The key seems to lie in how the "marker" colors change within a specific row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: 8
      - height: 8
      - cells: pixels with color values (0-9)

  - name: marker_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:  variable, not 0 or 1
      - location: (row, col)

  - name: background_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 0 or 1
      - location: (row, col)

actions:
   - name: copy
     description: duplicate sections of the grid with no changes

   - name: shift_marker
     description: "moves" marker by one cell

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: marker pixels are sparsely distributed within the grid, mostly on rows where the pattern changes.
  - type: conditional
    description: The transformation of marker pixels appears conditional on their initial position and color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Marker Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a color value other than 0 (black) or 1 (blue). These are the "marker" pixels.
2. **Copy Background:** all pixels that are value 0 (black) or 1 (blue) remain unchanged from the input to the output.
3.  **Transform Markers:** For each row containing marker pixels:
      a. examine the first non 0 or 1 pixel in the row. Note this location.
      b. output the noted value into the output grid at this same location.
      c. note the value to the left of first marker.
      d. continue to shift this value to all non 0 or 1 marker locations in the row
4.  **Copy Unchanged Rows:** All rows that *do not* contain any marker pixels are copied directly from the input to the output without modification.

In essence, the transformation involves identifying specific "marker" pixels and shifting the color value of the preceding pixel in the sequence of non blue/black to subsequent markers. Rows without markers are simply copied.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
