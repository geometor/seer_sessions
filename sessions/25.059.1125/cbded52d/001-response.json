The most prominent colors are blue (1), black (0), and some other colors that appear less frequently, acting as \"markers\". The overall structure is highly regular, with large areas of alternating blue and black pixels. The key seems to lie in how the \"marker\" colors change within a specific row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are the \"marker\" pixels.\n2. **Copy Background:** all pixels that are value 0 (black) or 1 (blue) remain unchanged from the input to the output.\n3.  **Transform Markers:** For each row containing marker pixels:\n      a. examine the first non 0 or 1 pixel in the row. Note this location.\n      b. output the noted value into the output grid at this same location.\n      c. note the value to the left of first marker.\n      d. continue to shift this value to all non 0 or 1 marker locations in the row\n4.  **Copy Unchanged Rows:** All rows that *do not* contain any marker pixels are copied directly from the input to the output without modification.\n\nIn essence, the transformation involves identifying specific \"marker\" pixels and shifting the color value of the preceding pixel in the sequence of non blue/black to subsequent markers. Rows without markers are simply copied.\n"
