**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small input grid (3x3) into a larger output grid (6x6). The input grids contain single-digit numbers, representing different colors. The output grids seem to be an expansion of the input, with a diagonal pattern formed by the non-zero elements of the input grid. The zero values in the input are treated as whitespace/background.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents the initial state.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents the transformed state.
  - property: non_zero_elements
    description: Elements in the input grid with values other than 0. These form the basis of the transformation.
  - action: diagonal_expansion
    description: The non-zero elements are expanded diagonally downwards and to the right.
  - relationship: input_output_size
    description: The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions (2n x 2n, where n=3).
  - relationship: zero_preservation
    description: Zero values seem to be preserved and fill the remaining spaces in the output grid.
  - action: input diagonal copy to output diagonal
    description: copy values from top-left to bottom right in input grid to output grid in same direction
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the size of the input grid (6x6, given the 3x3 input). Initialize all cells of the output grid to 0.

2.  **Diagonal Traversal and Expansion:** Traverse the input grid diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right.

3.  **Copy and Expansion:** For each non-zero element encountered in the input grid's diagonal, copy that element to the corresponding position in the output grid. Then copy the non-zero element to subsequent locations on the output grid on the diagonal extending to the bottom-right.
    *   The i, j index from the input grid is propogated to the output grid starting at 2\*i, 2\*j.

4.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** All remaining cells in the output grid, not filled during the diagonal expansion, remain at their initialized value of 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
