The input grids contain single-digit numbers, representing different colors. The output grids seem to be an expansion of the input, with a diagonal pattern formed by the non-zero elements of the input grid. The zero values in the input are treated as whitespace/background.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
