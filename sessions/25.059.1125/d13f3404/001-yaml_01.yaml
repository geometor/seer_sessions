facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents the initial state.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents the transformed state.
  - property: non_zero_elements
    description: Elements in the input grid with values other than 0. These form the basis of the transformation.
  - action: diagonal_expansion
    description: The non-zero elements are expanded diagonally downwards and to the right.
  - relationship: input_output_size
    description: The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions (2n x 2n, where n=3).
  - relationship: zero_preservation
    description: Zero values seem to be preserved and fill the remaining spaces in the output grid.
  - action: input diagonal copy to output diagonal
    description: copy values from top-left to bottom right in input grid to output grid in same direction
