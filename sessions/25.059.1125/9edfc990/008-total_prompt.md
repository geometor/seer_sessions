Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code implements a flood-fill algorithm, replacing '0' (white) pixels with a `fill_color` if they are adjacent to any pixel of a `seed_color`. The code includes a border exception, preventing '0' pixels on the grid's edge from being filled.

The initial hypothesis (and the generated code) was based on the first training example. By testing this hypothesis on the other examples, we will expose its flaws. By examining the results, we can better understand and improve the Natural Language Program and update the code to a general solution for all the example.

The strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each input/output pair, I will:
    *   Visually compare the input, expected output, and actual output (result of the `transform` function).
    *   Identify discrepancies.
    *   Determine *why* the current code failed to produce the correct output.
    *   Note any new patterns or rules that become apparent.
    *   Develop metrics, where relevant, by running python code to help assess the transformation
2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on step 1 for ALL examples, consolidate the individual observations into a coherent set of facts about the transformation. This involves looking for consistent rules across multiple examples, resolving contradictions, and formulating more precise descriptions.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the transformation, incorporating the new knowledge gained from all examples.
4. **Metrics:** gather specific details that will help in debugging code.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's analyze each example, noting discrepancies and gathering metrics. I'll use a code block to calculate discrepancies when necessary.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def calculate_discrepancy(expected_grid, actual_grid):
    """Calculates the number of differing pixels between two grids."""
    return np.sum(expected_grid != actual_grid)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
