The transformation seems to involve a significant change in the distribution of colors. Most notably, many pixels in the output grid are blue (represented by the number 1). There's a strong suggestion of a \"flood fill\" or similar operation, where existing colors are replaced by blue under certain conditions. The original colors are not entirely eliminated, suggesting that the filling process has specific stopping criteria, related to original input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
