- task: "Color Fill Based on First Row"
- observations:
    - "The output grid is derived from the input grid by filling regions with colors found in the first row of the input grid."
    - "An object is a contiguous block of pixels with a single color"
    - "If a contiguous block of pixels has a color not in the first row, it is filled with the color from the first row which is the background of the contiguous block"
    - "The background is defined as any pixel of a different color which is adjacent above, below, left or right"
- objects:
    - description: "Contiguous regions of the same color."
      properties:
        - color: "The color of the pixels in the object."
        - background: "colors adjacent to the object"
- actions:
    - fill: "Change the color of an object to match the background color, if the background color exists in the first row."
