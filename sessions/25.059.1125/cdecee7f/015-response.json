Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input is a 10x10 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), with a few scattered non-zero colored pixels.\n*   The output is a 3x3 grid, also of single-digit integers. It seems to contain only the non-zero digits from the input grid, but rearranged.\n*   The colors are maintained in transfer, so numbers have the same color\n    meaning.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
