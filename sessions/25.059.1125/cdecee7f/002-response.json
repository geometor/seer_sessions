Record the color value and original (x, y) coordinates of each.\n2. **Sort:** Sort the extracted colored pixels. It appears as though the sorting is first by the `y` and then by `x` coordinates, so pixels are effectively extracted in reading order (left-to-right, then top-to-bottom).\n3. **Arrange:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Place the sorted colored pixels into the 3x3 grid. The placement follows row-major order (filling the first row from left to right, then the second row, and finally the third row, skipping a cell if a row in input does not have enough pixels.).\n4. **Fill Remaining:**  Any remaining cells in the 3x3 grid that weren't filled with a colored pixel are set to 0, or kept empty.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_colored_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Extracts non-zero pixels and their coordinates.\"\"\"\n    colored_pixels = []\n    for y in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for x in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[y, x] != 0:\n                colored_pixels.append((grid[y, x], y, x))\n    return colored_pixels\n\ndef sort_pixels(pixels):\n    \"\"\"Sorts pixels by y and then x coordinate.\"\"\"\n    return sorted(pixels, key=lambda p: (p[1], p[2]))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n\n    # Extract non-zero pixels and their coordinates\n    colored_pixels = extract_colored_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # Sort pixels by their original y and x coordinates\n    sorted_pixels = sort_pixels(colored_pixels)\n\n    # Arrange pixels into the 3x3 grid\n    for i, (color, _, _) in enumerate(sorted_pixels):\n        if i < 9:  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n            row = i // 3\n            col = i % 3\n            output_grid[row, col] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
