Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains single-digit numbers (0-9), each representing a different color. The majority of the input grid cells are 0 (white). The non-zero numbers appear to be scattered throughout the grid. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, containing only the non-zero values from the input grid, re-arranged. The order of appearance in the input from top-left, row major does *not* correspond with the order in the output. There is some sort of reordering.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
input_type: grid
output_type: grid
input_dimensions: [10, 10]
output_dimensions: [3, 3]
input_values:
  - type: integer
  - range: [0, 9]
  - semantics: color_id
output_values:
  - type: integer
  - range: [0, 9]
    semantics: color_id
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [10, 10]
      - data_type: integer
  - name: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - data_type: integer
  - name: colored_pixels
    properties:
      - value: [1-9] # Non-zero values
      - location: [row_index, column_index] #in input grid
actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Extract all non-zero pixels from the input grid.
  - name: reorder
    description: Reorder the extracted pixels into a specific arrangement for the output grid.
  - name: arrange
    description: Arrange the reordered pixels to form 3 x 3 output
relationships:
   - input_grid contains colored_pixels
   - output_grid consists_of reordered colored_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Extract:** Identify and extract all non-zero pixels (colored pixels) from the input grid, noting their original values.
2. **Reorder:** Reorder the non zero numbers into a new sequence. The sequence will be bottom-left element in input is first, then moving up that column, wrapping to next column to the right when the top is reached.
3. **Arrange:** Populate the 3x3 output grid with the reordered non-zero pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
