The input grid appears to contain several single, isolated pixels of different colors, with the majority of the grid being white (represented by 0). The output grid seems to consolidate these colored pixels, maintaining their original color values, into a compact 3x3 form. The relative positions are changed. Empty rows/columns seem to separate the non-zero pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
