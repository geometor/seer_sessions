example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [7, 7]
        properties:
          - color_distribution: {0: 40, 1: 9}  # Example distribution
  output:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [3, 3]
        properties:
          - color_distribution: {1:9}
  relationship: output is a subgrid of input, located at the center.

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [5, 5]
        properties:
          - color_distribution: { 2:16, 3:9}
  output:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [3, 3]
        properties:
      - color_distribution: {3:9}
  relationship: output colors and configurations appear to derive, but NOT simply by position

example_3:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [9, 9]
        properties:
          - color_distribution: { 4:40, 7:41}
  output:
    objects:
      - type: grid
        dimensions: [3, 3]
        properties:
      - color_distribution: {7:9}
  relationship: output colors and configurations appear to derive, but NOT simply by position
