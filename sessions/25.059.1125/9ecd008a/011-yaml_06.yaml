facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids are always 9x9.
  - observation: |
      The output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is a compressed representation of the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves selecting specific colors from the input grid and placing them in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Example 1 has only color 5, and the transformation correctly produces a 3x3 grid of color 5.
  - observation: |
     Example 2 includes two areas of distinct color.
  - observation: |
     Example 3 has two distinct colored areas, one smaller than the other.
