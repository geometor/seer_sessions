The output is a much smaller, seemingly simplified grid, also composed of colored pixels. The output grid appears to represent a condensed or abstracted version of the input, focusing on a specific area or pattern. The core challenge lies in figuring out *which* area, and *how* the colors are selected/transformed. The example is suggestive of a selection of the center, with the background color removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
