facts:
  - observation: Input grids are square and large (e.g., 16x16).
  - observation: Output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids contain a prominent central cross-shaped structure made of '0' (white) pixels.
  - observation: The center of the cross is always empty.
  - observation: The output grid's colors seem to correspond to colors present in the input grid, possibly related to their relative positions.
  - observation: The output grid's cells are colored and have a black border.
  - relationship: The output is likely a summarized or sampled representation of the input, focused on specific color features.
