The output is a much smaller square grid, also filled with single-digit numbers. The output grid's dimensions (3x3) are significantly smaller than the input grid's (16x16). There appears to be some form of abstraction or summarization occurring, reducing the complex input into a simplified output. The colors present in output are all present in the input. The output grid seems like it represents a zoomed-out or lower resolution of some parts of the input grid. Specifically, the output pixels could be some kind of representation of a large block in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
