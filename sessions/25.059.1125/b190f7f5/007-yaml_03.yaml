facts:
  - object_types:
      - pixel: "A single cell in the input grid."
      - block: "A 3x3 group of pixels in the output grid."
  - input_properties:
      - grid_size: "Variable, ranging from 1x1 to 14x14 in the examples."
      - pixel_values: "Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors."
  - output_properties:
      - grid_size: "Always 3 times the dimensions of the input grid (3x scaling)."
      - block_values: "Correspond to the input pixel values, except for 0 which remains a 3x3 block of 0s."
  - transformation_rules:
      - scaling: "Each non-zero input pixel expands to a 3x3 block of the same color in the output."
      - zero_preservation: "Input pixels with a value of 0 are expanded into a 3x3 block of 0s."
      - relative_positioning: "The relative positions of pixels/blocks are maintained."
