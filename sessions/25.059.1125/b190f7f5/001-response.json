The transformation seems to involve replicating non-zero pixels in specific patterns, creating larger colored blocks, and expanding the grid size. The zero-value pixels (white) act as a background and are modified by replication. Key actions are replication and expansion. Relationships appear to be about copying/moving pixels to form the larger image.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If any parts of the 3x3 blocks overlap, the non-zero value is maintained.\n\n3. **Expand the output grid:** The output grid is significantly larger than the input grid. The precise dimensions of the output grid appear to be related to the original grid size and number of objects.\n\n4. The original shape and relationship of non-zero pixels in the original image are maintained in the larger output grid. The transformation expands and replicates.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any of these sections refined before we move on to the coding phase!\n"
