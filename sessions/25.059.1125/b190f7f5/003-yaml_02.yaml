objects:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel_block
    description: expanded representation of non-zero input pixels
    properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3
        - color: matches the corresponding input pixel

actions:
    - name: expand
      agent: non-zero pixels
      description: each non-zero pixel in input becomes 3x3 block in output
      details: expansion maintains relative positioning

    - name: fill
      agent: zero pixels
      description: zero pixels expand to zero, to a 3x3

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Relative positions of pixels in the input grid are preserved in the expanded output grid, with 3X the distance
