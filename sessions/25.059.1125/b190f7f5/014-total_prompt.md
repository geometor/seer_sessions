Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Dynamic Output Grid:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by multiplying the input grid's dimensions by 3. Create an output grid filled with white (0) pixels.
2. **Azure Removal:** Ignore azure (8) pixels in the input grid; they don't affect the output.
3. **Colored Pixel Replication:** For each yellow (4), blue (1), and red (2) pixel in the input grid:
    - Calculate the top-left corner coordinates in the output grid by multiplying the input row and column indices by 3.
    - Create a "plus" shape centered at the calculated coordinates with the color of the input pixel. The plus extends one pixel in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the center.  The plus is truncated if it would extend beyond the output grid boundaries.

    # initialize output_grid based on input_grid size, multiplied by 3
    output_rows = input_grid.shape[0] * 3
    output_cols = input_grid.shape[1] * 3
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)

    # iterate through the input grid
    for r in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            color = input_grid[r, c]

            # skip azure (8) and white (0)
            if color == 8 or color == 0:
                continue

            # calculate the center coordinates for the plus shape
            out_r = r * 3
            out_c = c * 3

            # Create the plus shape, ensuring it stays within bounds
            if out_r > 0:
                output_grid[out_r - 1, out_c] = color  # Up
            if out_r < output_rows - 1:
                output_grid[out_r + 1, out_c] = color  # Down
            if out_c > 0:
                output_grid[out_r, out_c - 1] = color  # Left
            if out_c < output_cols - 1:
                output_grid[out_r, out_c + 1] = color  # Right
            output_grid[out_r, out_c] = color  # Center

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, correctly capturing the core concept of replicating a "plus" shape for each non-azure, non-white pixel. However, the testing revealed discrepancies, specifically related to the positioning and size of the replicated shapes. The initial assumption of a simple 3x scaling and direct translation of coordinates needs adjustment. The plus signs are, in fact, 3x3, with the input color pixel's location mapped to the top-left corner cell of the reproduced shape.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Re-examine Coordinate Mapping:** The primary issue is the incorrect coordinate transformation. Instead of the center of the "plus" being at `(r*3, c*3)`, it should be adjusted.
2. **Plus Sign Size and Position Refinement:** The plus sign should be interpreted as the 'center' pixel with arms extending. Revisit the plus size.
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic against *all* training examples after each modification.

**Metrics and Observations (from the code and examples):**

Here's a more precise analysis of the examples, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with yellow, blue, and red pixels.
    *   Output: 9x9 grid with correctly colored "plus" shapes. The initial program works perfectly here.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 with a red pixel at (0,0)
    *   Output: 15x15, red 'plus' at (0,0).
*   **Example 3:**
    *  Input 2x2 with red at (1,0), blue at (0, 1), and azure at (1, 1).
    * Output: 6x6 with the red 'plus' at (3, 0) and blue 'plus' at (0, 3)
*  **Example 4:**
    * Input 4 x 3. One blue pixel at (3, 2)
    * Output: 12 x 9. The blue 'plus' shape should appear at (9,6)

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: |
      The input grid contains pixels of various colors, including azure, which are ignored in the transformation.
  - description: |
      The output grid is three times larger than the input grid in both dimensions.
  - description: |
      Each non-azure, non-white pixel in the input grid corresponds to a "plus" shaped structure in the output grid.
  - description: |
      The color of the "plus" shape matches the color of the corresponding input pixel.
  - description: |
      The top-left corner cell of plus shape in the output is determined by multiplying the row and column indices of the corresponding input pixel by 3.
  - description: |
      Azure pixels in the input do not generate any output.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Output Grid Initialization:** Create an output grid with dimensions three times larger than the input grid (width * 3, height * 3). Initialize it with all white (0) pixels.

2.  **Input Grid Iteration:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.

3.  **Azure Pixel Handling:** If the input pixel is azure (8) or white (0), skip to the next pixel.

4.  **Plus Shape Generation:** For each non-azure, non-white pixel:
    *   Calculate the output coordinates for the top-left of the shape: Multiply the row and column indices of the input pixel by 3. This gives the top-left corner of the 3x3 plus shape.
    *   Create 3x3 'plus' shape - centered at (out_row + 1, out_col + 1), using a fill of the input pixel's color.

5.  **Return Output Grid:** The output grid now contains the transformed representation of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
