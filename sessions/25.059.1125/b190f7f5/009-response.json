The colors present in the input are white (0), azure (8), yellow (4), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid expands the input and rearranges/replicates certain colored pixels. The azure (8) pixels seem to be removed. There's a noticeable replication of the yellow, blue, and red pixels, with their positions influencing the pattern of replication in the output.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

However, when placed in the output, extend a single pixel horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, creating a plus sign if the expanded pixel is not obstructed by another color.\n\nIn essence, the input grid acts as a blueprint. Every colored pixel, except azure, defines where its color should appear and be replicated twice downwards and twice to the right within a 3x3 block. The azure colored pixels are completely discarded.\n"
