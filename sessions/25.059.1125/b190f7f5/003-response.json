The colors in the input grid seem to dictate the shape and color of larger structures in the output grid. The input grid appears to be \"inflated\" or \"expanded\" into the output, with zeros in the input corresponding to blank areas in the output. Non-zero pixels expand to 3x3 blocks, and the relative positions of the different colors appear important, as the placement of expanded blocks reflects the layout of the source.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
