facts:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x8
      - colors: [red, yellow, azure, white]
    observations:
      - Non-white pixels form a diagonal cross structure (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom left).
      - Colors appear in diagonal lines.

  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 16x16
      - colors: [red, yellow, azure, white]
    observations:
      -  The arrangement of colors creates a mirrored, cross-like shape, emanating from the center
      -  Input non-zero pixels appear expanded and mirrored along both diagonals.
      -  Large areas of white pixels separate colored sections.
      - colors of input grid are preserved in the output grid.
      
  - type: transformation
    properties:
      - relationship: input to output
    observations:
     - Input grid is conceptually centered and expanded in output grid.
     - Each non-zero pixel in the input becomes a 4x4 block of the same color in output, and mirrors it.
     - Output grid size is calculated from input grid size. New width is 2*input.width and new height is 4*input.height, then whichever one is bigger is chosen for width and height of output.
     - Mirror plane follows the diagonals from pixel at output grid coordinates (new_width//2, new_height//2).
