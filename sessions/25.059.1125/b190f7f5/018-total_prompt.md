Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding and mirroring non-zero pixels to create a larger output grid. The provided code does this by creating a 2x2 block for each non-zero pixel and then mirroring it to form a 4x4 block. While this works for the first example, it fails on the subsequent examples. This indicates that the transformation rule is more nuanced and likely involves different expansion/mirroring logic or conditions based on the input grid's characteristics. We need to identify other properties, like position and object size to use as context for deciding the transformation.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the spatial relationships, colors, and sizes of objects before and after the transformation. The current code only considers non zero values.
2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for consistent patterns across *all* examples. The initial assumption of simple 2x2 expansion and mirroring is incorrect. There might be different expansion factors, different mirroring axes, or conditional transformations based on pixel values or positions.
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the identified patterns, iteratively refine the transformation logic. Test new transforms against existing code and gather more information.
4. **Metrics Gathering:** I will execute the function using a testing harness to confirm that it has or has not solved the example.

**YAML Facts and Natural Language Program:**

Here's a combined YAML and natural language program description, incorporating observations from all training examples. I will add specific coordinate and dimensional data after running tests with a notebook.

```yaml
observations:
  example_0:
    input:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: single pixel
          position: [1, 1] # center
    output:
      dimensions: [12, 12]
      objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: 4x4 block
          position: [4, 4]  # relative to the output grid's center
    transformation:
      type: expansion and mirroring
      details: "Each non-zero pixel becomes a 4x4 block centered within a 12x12 grid."
      solved: True
  example_1:
    input:
      dimensions: [5, 2]
      objects:
        - color: green
          shape: single pixel
          position: [2, 0] # center-left
    output:
      dimensions: [20, 8]
      objects:
      - color: green
        shape: 4x4 block
        position: [ 8, 0 ]
    transformation:
      type: expansion and mirroring
      details: "Each non-zero pixel becomes a 4x4 block, possibly with adjusted centering/positioning. Height is multiplied by 4 and Width multiplied by 4."
      solved: False
  example_2:
    input:
      dimensions: [1, 4]
      objects:
      - color: 'yellow'
        shape: 'single pixel'
        position: [ 0, 1 ]
      - color: 'red'
        shape: 'single pixel'
        position: [ 0, 2 ]
    output:
      dimensions: [ 4, 16 ]
      objects:
      - color: 'yellow'
        shape: '4x4 block'
        position: [ 0, 4 ]
      - color: 'red'
        shape: '4x4 block'
        position: [ 0, 8 ]
    transformation:
      type: expansion and mirroring
      details: "Each non-zero pixel becomes a 4x4 block. Output grid is calculated by height * 4, width * 4"
    solved: False

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Analysis:** The input is a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value (0-9).
2.  **Object Identification:** Identify each non-zero pixel as an individual object.
3.  **Output Grid Dimensions**: The output has the following dimensions:
    - height = 4 * input\_height
    - width = 4 * input\_width
4. **Expansion and Mirroring**: For *each* non-zero pixel in the input grid:

    *   Create a 4x4 block of the same color in the output grid.
    *   The position will be determined by multiplying the input position by 4 for both height and width.
5. The output grid size can be calculated by using 4x input size.

**Next Steps**
I will modify and re-run code to test.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
