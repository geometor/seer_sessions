The output retains these, but some white (0) pixels are replaced.\n*   **Changes:** The most obvious change is that some of the white (0) pixels in the input become magenta (6) or yellow(4) in the output.\n    *   The top-right pixel with value 6 in the input, stays 6 in the output.\n    *   The middle pixel with value 4 in the input, stays 4 in the output.\n    *   The lower-left pixel with value 3 stays 3 in the input.\n    *   The white pixel to the left of 6 becomes 6.\n    *   The white pixel below 4 becomes 4.\n    *   The white pixel below 6 becomes 6.\n    *    The white pixel to the right of 4 become 4.\n    *   All other white pixels are gone.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

If a pixel is not white (0), keep its value unchanged in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n2.  **Propagate Magenta and Yellow:** For each white (0) pixel in the input grid:\n    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). Diagonal is not considered to be adjacent.\n    *   If any neighbor is magenta (6), change the white pixel to magenta (6) in the output grid.\n    *    If any neighbor is yellow (4), change the white pixel to yellow(4) in the output grid.\n3. **Fill Remaining:** In this example, there are no remaining white cells. If white cells had remained, those would stay white.\n\nIn summary, the transformation propagates the colors magenta (6) and yellow (4) from existing pixels to adjacent white (0) pixels. The green (3) does not propagate.\n"
