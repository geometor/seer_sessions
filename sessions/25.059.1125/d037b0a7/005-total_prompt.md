Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Preserve Non-White:** Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is not white (0), keep its value unchanged in the corresponding position of the output grid.
2.  **Propagate Magenta and Yellow:** For each white (0) pixel in the input grid:
    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). Diagonal is not considered to be adjacent.
    *   If any neighbor is magenta (6), change the white pixel to magenta (6) in the output grid.
    *    If any neighbor is yellow (4), change the white pixel to yellow(4) in the output grid.
3. **Fill Remaining:** In this example, there are no remaining white cells. If white cells had remained, those would stay white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
