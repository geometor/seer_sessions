Pixels that do *not* have the majority color are \"special pixels.\"\n\n2.  **Preserve Special Pixels:** Special pixels retain their original colors in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Background Pixel Transformation - Simple Adjacency:**\n    *   If a background pixel (majority color) is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a special pixel of color 8, change the background pixel to 8.\n    *   If a background pixel is adjacent to color 1, change it to 8.\n    *   If a background pixel is adjacent to color 4, change it to 8.\n    *   Special pixels with colors 5 and 6 do not cause changes to neighboring background pixels.\n\n4.  **Background Pixel Transformation - Vertical Stripes and Alternating Fill (refined):**\n    *   If there are 2x2 blocks of special pixels forming vertical stripes where a column of color `C1` is immediately to the left or right of a column of color `C2`, then apply an alternating fill:\n\n      *   If a background pixel is adjacent to `C1` it will transform to a fill color.\n      *   The fill color is determined as follows:\n        *   If C1 = 3 and C2 = 8, the fill color is 3.\n        *   If C1 = 8 and C2 = 3, the fill color is 6.\n        *   If C1 = 3 and C2 is any other color except 8, the fill color is 6\n\n5. **Prioritization**: Simple adjacency rules take precedence. The Vertical Stripe rule applies to what remains.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_special_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies \"special\" pixels (those not of the majority color).\n    \"\"\"\n    values, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    majority_color = values[np.argmax(counts)]\n    special_pixels = {}\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] != majority_color:\n                special_pixels[(r, c)] = grid[r, c]\n    return special_pixels, majority_color\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Gets the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of a pixel.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = {}\n    for i in range(max(0, r - 1), min(grid.shape[0], r + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, c - 1), min(grid.shape[1], c + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (r, c):\n                neighbors[(i, j)] = grid[i, j]\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, color1, color2):\n    \"\"\"Checks if special pixels form vertical stripes with given colors.\"\"\"\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if (r,c) in special_pixels and grid[r,c] == color1:\n              if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == color2 and (r, c-1) in special_pixels:\n                return True\n              if c < grid.shape[1] -1 and grid[r,c+1] == color2 and (r, c+1) in special_pixels:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    special_pixels, majority_color = get_special_pixels(grid)\n\n    # Preserve special pixels\n    for (r, c), color in special_pixels.items():\n        output_grid[r, c] = color\n\n    # Background pixel transformation - Simple Adjacency\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == majority_color:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, r, c)\n                neighbor_colors = list(neighbors.values())\n\n                if 8 in neighbor_colors or 1 in neighbor_colors or 4 in neighbor_colors:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 8\n\n    # Background Pixel Transformation - Vertical Stripes (after adjacency)\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if output_grid[r,c] == majority_color:\n                if is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, 3, 8):\n                    if c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 3 and (r, c-1) in special_pixels:\n                        output_grid[r, c] = 3\n\n                elif is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, 8, 3):\n                    if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == 8 and (r, c-1) in special_pixels:\n                         output_grid[r,c] = 6\n                elif is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, 3, 6) or is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, 3, 0):  #check for other colors adjacent to color 3\n                  if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == 3 and (r,c-1) in special_pixels:\n                        output_grid[r,c] = 6\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
