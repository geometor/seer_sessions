Special pixels maintain their color. Background pixels are transformed based on the presence of specific colors among their immediate neighbors. Gray(5) and Magenta(6) are unchanged. If azure (8) is present, change to azure(8). Specific color interactions occur between 1, 4, and 8. Alternating fills occur in vertically striped patterns involving colors 3, 6, and 8.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_special_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies \"special\" pixels (those not of the majority color).\n    \"\"\"\n    values, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    majority_color = values[np.argmax(counts)]\n    special_pixels = {}\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] != majority_color:\n                special_pixels[(r, c)] = grid[r, c]\n    return special_pixels, majority_color\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Gets the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of a pixel.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = {}\n    for i in range(max(0, r - 1), min(grid.shape[0], r + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, c - 1), min(grid.shape[1], c + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (r, c):\n                neighbors[(i, j)] = grid[i, j]\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, colors):\n    \"\"\"Checks if special pixels form vertical stripes with given colors.\"\"\"\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if (r,c) in special_pixels and grid[r,c] == colors[0]:\n              if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == colors[1]:\n                return True\n              if c < grid.shape[1] -1 and grid[r,c+1] == colors[1]:\n                return True\n    return False\n    \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    special_pixels, majority_color = get_special_pixels(grid)\n\n    # Special pixel mapping (maintain color)\n    special_pixel_mapping = {\n        1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 8: 8, 5:5, 6:6\n    }\n\n    for (r, c), color in special_pixels.items():\n        output_grid[r, c] = special_pixel_mapping.get(color, color)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == majority_color:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, r, c)\n                neighbor_colors = list(neighbors.values())\n                neighbor_special_pixels = [(nr, nc) for (nr, nc) in neighbors if (nr,nc) in special_pixels]\n\n                if 5 in [grid[nr,nc] for (nr,nc) in neighbor_special_pixels] or 6 in [grid[nr,nc] for (nr,nc) in neighbor_special_pixels]:\n                    continue\n\n                if 8 in neighbor_colors:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 8\n                    continue\n\n                # check vertical stripes for alternating fill\n                if is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, [3,8]):\n                  if c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == 8 and (r,c-1) in special_pixels:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 3\n                    continue\n                elif is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, [8,3]):\n                  if c>0 and grid[r,c-1] == 3 and (r,c-1) in special_pixels:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 6\n                    continue\n                elif is_vertically_striped(grid, special_pixels, [3,0]):\n                  if c>0 and grid[r,c-1] == 3 and (r,c-1) in special_pixels:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 6\n                    continue\n                \n                # Special interaction between 1 and 8\n                if 1 in neighbor_colors:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = 8\n                    continue\n                \n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
