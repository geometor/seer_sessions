Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and the training examples to refine the natural language program and identify the necessary adjustments.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. While it performed correctly on that specific example, it failed on others. The primary issue seems to be an oversimplification of the propagation rules. The propagation appears to be more complex than just simple adjacency. We need to investigate the spatial relationships and constraints more carefully and add conditions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Examine Failures:** Focus on the examples where the code failed (Examples 2 and 3). Analyze the differences between the expected output and the actual output. Identify where the propagation logic deviates.
2.  **Refine Propagation Rules:** Determine if there are additional constraints or conditions on the propagation of azure and red colors, like blocking colors, or limited distances.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the natural language program to accurately describe the observed behavior, including any newly discovered constraints.
4.   **YAML -** Write a clear and concise description of the input, and output grids, and how they seem to relate.
5.  **Iterate:** This refined natural language program will then inform the next iteration of code.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
Here are the results of the transform function applied to each example input, and the expected result:

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: azure_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    propagation:
      rule: "Adjacent to existing azure, excluding diagonals"
      constraints: "Only propagates to blue (1) pixels"
      blocking_colors: "any color other than blue (1) blocks"

  - object: red_pixels
    color: red (2)
    propagation:
      rule: "Adjacent to the existing red, including diagonals"
      constraints: "Only propagates to blue (1) pixels in the row the seed is in or the row below."
      blocking_colors: "any color other than blue(1) blocks"
  - input_grid:
      description: "A 2D array of integers representing colors"
  - output_grid:
      description: "The transformed input grid after applying propagation rules"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Seeds:** Locate all pixels colored azure (8) in the input grid.

2.  **Limited Azure Propagation:** For each azure pixel, change any directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but *not* diagonally) blue (1) pixels to azure. Other colors block propagation.

3.  **Identify Red Seed:** Find the single pixel colored red (2) in the input grid.

4.  **Limited Red Propagation:**
    *   Red propagates only to the row it starts in and the row directly beneath it.
    *   For an adjacent pixel (including diagonals) of the red pixel, change any blue (1) pixel to red (2). Other colors block propagation.

The key updates here are the specification of "not diagonally" for azure propagation and the row constraint, and all adjacent for the red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
