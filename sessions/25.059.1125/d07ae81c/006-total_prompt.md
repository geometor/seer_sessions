"""
The transformation rule distinguishes between "special pixels" (those not having the majority color) and "background pixels" (those having the majority color). Special pixels maintain their color. Background pixels are transformed based on the presence of specific colors among their immediate neighbors. Gray(5) and Magenta(6) are unchanged. If azure (8) is present, change to azure(8). Specific color interactions occur between 1, 4, and 8. Alternating fills occur in vertically striped patterns involving colors 3, 6, and 8.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the current `transform` function to the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the concept of "special pixels" (non-majority color) and the influence of neighbors. However, the tests reveal errors, indicating that the logic concerning neighbor interactions and specific color transformations needs refinement. The vertically striped pattern detection and associated fills also appear to have some problems. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** For each failed example, pinpoint the exact locations where the output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Pattern Refinement:** Based on the errors, adjust the rules related to neighbor interactions and color changes, paying close attention to the conditions under which specific colors are applied.
3.  **Vertical Stripe Logic:** Revisiting the vertical stripe detection logic to resolve any bugs or incompleteness.

**Metrics and Code Execution**

To get accurate information, I'll use `code_execution` for some checks. Because I can't directly execute code, I will formulate this as pseudocode and derive general properties of the grids and predictions to document.

*Example metrics process (pseudo-code):*

```python
# For each training example:
#   input_grid, expected_output = get_example(example_number)
#   predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
#   differences = find_differences(predicted_output, expected_output)
#   print(f"Example {example_number}:")
#   print(f"  Input Shape: {input_grid.shape}")
#   print(f"  Majority Color: {get_majority_color(input_grid)}")
#   print(f"  Special Pixels: {get_special_pixels(input_grid)}")
#   print(f"  Number of Differences: {len(differences)}")
#   print(f"  Locations of Differences: {differences}") # (row, col, predicted_color, expected_color)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Special Pixels:** Determine the majority color in the input grid. Pixels that do *not* have the majority color are "special pixels."

2.  **Preserve Special Pixels:** Special pixels retain their original colors in the output grid.

3.  **Background Pixel Transformation - Simple Adjacency:**
    *   If a background pixel (majority color) is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a special pixel of color 8, change the background pixel to 8.
    *   If a background pixel is adjacent to color 1, change it to 8.
    *   If a background pixel is adjacent to color 4, change it to 8.
    *   Special pixels with colors 5 and 6 do not cause changes to neighboring background pixels.

4.  **Background Pixel Transformation - Vertical Stripes and Alternating Fill (refined):**
    *   If there are 2x2 blocks of special pixels forming vertical stripes where a column of color `C1` is immediately to the left or right of a column of color `C2`, then apply an alternating fill:

      *   If a background pixel is adjacent to `C1` it will transform to a fill color.
      *   The fill color is determined as follows:
        *   If C1 = 3 and C2 = 8, the fill color is 3.
        *   If C1 = 8 and C2 = 3, the fill color is 6.
        *   If C1 = 3 and C2 is any other color except 8, the fill color is 6

5. **Prioritization**: Simple adjacency rules take precedence. The Vertical Stripe rule applies to what remains.

The key changes are:

*   Clarified the adjacency rules and added explicit handling of 1, 4 and 8.
*   Reworded and clarified the vertical stripe logic.
*   Added a prioritization: first handle adjacency, *then* vertical stripes.
    This makes it so that the vertical fills don't override other rules.

This refined natural language program should provide a more accurate and complete description of the transformation rule. It incorporates observations from all training examples and addresses the identified errors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
