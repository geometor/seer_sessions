The colors present are green (3), blue (1), red (2), and azure (8). The most salient changes are the appearances of many red (2) pixels and a few strategically placed azure (8) pixels. The overall shapes formed by green and blue remain consistent. The position of the original single red pixel and some azure pixels appear influential.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Extend this to include diagonals.\n\nIn essence, the transformation \"grows\" azure and red regions from their initial positions, but it prioritizes filling blues adjacent to initial seed pixels with the respective color.\n"
