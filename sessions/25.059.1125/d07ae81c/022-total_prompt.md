```python
"""
The transformation identifies a central blue stripe in the input grid and mirrors/shifts parts of it in the output grid. Blue (1) pixels become green (3) based on their position relative to the center and other colors. Green (3) pixels are preserved, and a single magenta (6) pixel appears to the right.  Azure (8) pixels appear to follow different, complex rules based on mirroring.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program captured some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the mirroring around a central blue stripe and the change of blue to green. However, the handling of azure, magenta, and the precise conditions for mirroring and color changes need refinement. The provided results show discrepancies between the predicted output and the actual output, especially in the placement of magenta and handling of azure. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Examine each example's input, expected output, and actual output to pinpoint where the code's logic deviates from the true transformation.
2.  **Object and Relationship Identification:**  Clearly define the objects (regions of color), their attributes (color, position, size), and their relationships (adjacency, mirroring).
3.  **Refine Transformation Rules:** Based on the error analysis, adjust the rules for mirroring, color changes, and the placement of magenta and azure pixels. The conditions appear more complex than initially assumed.
4. **Update natural language and code:** make iterative improvements as we gather more information

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations**

I need to visually compare the input, expected output, and actual output grids. I'll create a function that outputs them as numpy grids.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    """Compares the input, expected output, and actual output grids."""

    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("\nExpected Output Grid:")
    print(expected_output)
    print("\nActual Output Grid:")
    print(actual_output)
    print("-" * 20)

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: central_stripe
    type: vertical_line
    color: blue (1)
    position: center_column(s)
    behavior:
      - changes_to: green (3)

  - name: mirrored_regions
    type: regions
    relation: symmetrical_to central_stripe
    behavior:
      - color_change_conditional:
          from: blue (1)
          to: green (3)

  - name: azure_regions
    type: regions
    color: azure (8)
    position: adjacent to central_stripe, mirrored
    behavior: stays azure(8)

  - name: green_pixel
    type: single_pixel
    color: green (3)
    position: edge
    behavior:
      - adjacent_magenta: places magenta (6) to the right if available

rules:
  - rule_1:  "Find the central vertical stripe(s) of blue pixels."
  - rule_2: "All blue pixels in the central stripe(s) change to green."
  - rule_3: "Regions on either side of the central stripe are mirrored."
  - rule_4: "Mirrored blue pixels become green."
  - rule_5: "Azure pixels adjacent to the central stripe on either side remain azure."
  - rule_6: "A green pixel at the edge places a magenta pixel to its immediate right, if no other green is present"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Central Stripe:** Locate the vertical column(s) of blue (1) pixels in the center of the grid. There can be one, two, or three adjacent center columns forming the stripe.
2.  **Central Stripe Transformation:** Change all blue (1) pixels within the identified central stripe to green (3).
3.  **Mirroring:** Mirror the grid content from left to right, using the central stripe as the axis of symmetry.
4.  **Conditional Color Change (Mirrored):** Within the mirrored regions, change blue (1) pixels to green (3).
5.  **Azure Preservation:**  Azure (8) pixels that are adjacent to the central stripe in the input, and are therefore also present in the mirrored locations, remain azure (8) in the output.
6.  **Green and Magenta Interaction:** If a green (3) pixel is at the edge (leftmost or rightmost in its row), and there isn't another green to the right of it, place a magenta (6) pixel immediately to its right, provided the space exists and will not overlap another.
7. All other pixels are unaffected by the transformation

This revised natural language program provides a more accurate and complete description of the transformation, taking into account the behavior observed across all training examples. The key improvements are the precise definition of the central stripe, the explicit mirroring rule, clarification of azure pixel handling, and a more detailed condition for magenta placement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
