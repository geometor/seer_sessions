The primary colors observed are blue (1), magenta (6), and azure (8), with a few instances of green (3). There's a distinct vertical stripe of blue (1) pixels running down the center of the input grid. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, with some color changes and a seemingly more chaotic arrangement, while preserving some elements of the original vertical structure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, columns 7, 8 and 9 form the central blue stripe.\n\n2.  **Mirror/Shuffle and Recolour:** It appears the output grid redistributes some colors around the center, in some places, some colors from the center seem to have 'fallen' down and others across. In the example, there is a general diffusion of some of the original stripe pixels (1) outwards and downwards, sometimes changing color to green(3), other times to azure(8).\n3.  **Preserve Green pixels:**  Where there's an isolated green pixel, surround the other colors to highlight the green.\n\n4.  **Special Rule for 8 (Azure):** Azure (8) pixels in the input seem to have special, potentially chaotic behavior in how they are or aren't preserved, and in what positions. Where a blue pixel is to be mirrored, if there is already an azure pixel, the blue may also change to azure.\n\n5. **Center line:** The central line (column 8) has the unique characteristic that many colors remain after transformation.\n\nEssentially, the transformation involves a complex operation around a mirrored/shifted, recoloured version of central blue stripe, while preserving or highlighting isolated elements, with some special rules for azure (8).\n"
