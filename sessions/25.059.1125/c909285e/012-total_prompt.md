Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and focused on extracting a 7x7 subgrid centered around a red object. The testing revealed that while this works for the first example, it fails for the others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't simply about extracting a fixed-size subgrid. It's more about identifying a specific *pattern* or *object* and its relationship to other elements in the grid. The size of the output and its relationship to the input may vary.

Here's the overall strategy:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair to identify common patterns and unique characteristics.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current code assumes a "central red object". This needs to be generalized. We need to consider other colors and shapes. Are objects contiguous? Are they defined by borders?
3.  **Determine Transformation Logic:** Is it always extraction? Are there cases of color changes, rotations, or other operations? The initial assumption of a simple extraction needs to be verified.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the *generalized* transformation rule.
5.  **Prepare for Code Modification:** Clearly document the changes needed in the code in the YAML section, so the coder phase can make effective modifications.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To provide accurate metrics and reports, I will hypothetically execute code snippets. I am, of course, unable to actually *run* the code, I will provide you with the *intent*.

Here's a breakdown of each example, including hypothetical code execution to gather information:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 15x15, complex pattern with a central red "frame".
*   **Output:** 7x7, the inner part of the red frame.
*   **Code Result:** Success.
*   **Metrics:**
    ```python
    # Hypothetical Code Execution
    import numpy as np
    input_grid = np.array([[...]]) # the provided array
    output_grid = np.array([[...]])
    input_shape = input_grid.shape  # (15, 15)
    output_shape = output_grid.shape # (7, 7)

    #check for existence of the identified object
    #find_central_object using object color = 2
    #result:  (4, 10, 4, 10)

    #find object inside of the red frame
    #rows, cols = np.where(input_grid[4:11, 4:11] != 2)
    #center_row = rows.mean()+4
    #center_col = cols.mean()+4
    #center: (7,7)

    #colors
    unique_input_colors = np.unique(input_grid) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
    unique_output_colors = np.unique(output_grid) # [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]

    ```
*   **Observations:** The initial code correctly identified and extracted the central pattern. The output consists of the content *inside* the red frame.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 11x11, a blue 'L' shape surrounding gray pixels.
*   **Output:** 3x3, the gray pixels surrounded by the blue 'L'.
*   **Code Result:** Fail, likely due to using color `2`. Output shape mismatch.
*   **Metrics:**
    ```python
    # Hypothetical Code Execution
    import numpy as np
    input_grid = np.array([[...]])
    output_grid = np.array([[...]])
    input_shape = input_grid.shape  # (11, 11)
    output_shape = output_grid.shape # (3, 3)

    #check for existence of the identified object
    #find_central_object using object color = 2
    #result:  None

    #find_central_object using object color = 1
    #result:  (2, 9, 1, 4)

    #find object inside of the frame
    #rows, cols = np.where(input_grid[2:10, 1:5] != 1)

    #center: (6,3)

    #colors
    unique_input_colors = np.unique(input_grid) # [0, 1, 5]
    unique_output_colors = np.unique(output_grid) # [5]
    ```
*   **Observations:** The "frame" is blue (color 1), not red. The output contains only the gray (color 5) pixels enclosed by the blue 'L'.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 15x11, an orange (color 7) shape, appears like a stylized "3".
*   **Output:** 5x3, the internal gray (color 5) pixels, with a single orange pixel.
*   **Code Result:** Fail, likely due to using color `2`. Output shape mismatch.
*      **Metrics:**

    ```python
    # Hypothetical Code Execution
    import numpy as np
    input_grid = np.array([[...]])
    output_grid = np.array([[...]])
    input_shape = input_grid.shape  # (15, 11)
    output_shape = output_grid.shape # (5, 3)
    #check for existence of the identified object
    #find_central_object using object color = 2
    #result:  None

    #find_central_object using object color = 7
    #result:  (4, 10, 4, 6)

    #find object inside of the frame
    #rows, cols = np.where(input_grid[4:11, 4:7] != 7)

    #center: (7,5)

    #colors
    unique_input_colors = np.unique(input_grid) # [0, 5, 7]
    unique_output_colors = np.unique(output_grid) # [5, 7]

    ```
*   **Observations:** The "frame" is orange.  The output is the gray pixels *inside* the orange shape, *plus* one orange pixel from the "frame".

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain a distinct "framing" object that encloses other pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The framing object can be of different colors (red, blue, orange). It's not always centrally located.
  - object_properties:
      - color: variable (red, blue, orange in the examples)
      - shape: Contiguous, but the exact shape varies (rectangle, L-shape, "3"-like).
  - action: |
      The transformation extracts the pixels enclosed *within* the framing object.
  - output_characteristics: |
      The output grid contains the pixels inside the frame. In at least one case, one pixel of the frame is included.
  - exceptions:
      - One pixel of the framing color is also present in the output for Example 3.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Framing Object:** Find the largest contiguous object in the input grid that forms a "frame" around other pixels. The frame can be of any color and shape, but it must enclose other pixels.
2. **Extract Interior:** Extract all pixels that are located *inside* the identified frame.
3. **Include Frame Pixel (Conditional):**  If all enclosed pixels are the same color, include in the output one pixel of the framing object's color if it touches (adjacent) an inside pixel.

This natural language program now addresses the variations observed across all three training examples. It generalizes the concept of a "framing object" and focuses on extracting the enclosed content, with a rule added to account for Example 3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
