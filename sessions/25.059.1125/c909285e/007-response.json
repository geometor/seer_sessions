            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to identify a specific \"flower\" pattern and extract a 7x7 region around its green center, replacing non-flower pixels within that region with green. This approach works for the first training example but fails on others. The core issue is that the code is overly specific to the *exact* layout of the first example and doesn't generalize to variations in flower structure or the presence of other objects. The other examples demonstrate that the core concept is identifying a 7x7 \"flower\" pattern. The code's rigid `is_flower_pixel` function, center finding and replacement logic, is the primary source of failure.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern Recognition:** The `is_flower_pixel` function needs to be less rigid. Instead of hardcoding relative positions of colors, it needs to be centered on the flower, which can be of different colors.\n\n2.  **Generalized Output:** Since output is just that 7x7 pattern, focus on extracting it, without alterations based on training example 01.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution & Manual Inspection):**\nI don't have code execution capabilities. I have to use my reasoning based on the ARC-AGI rules.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Contains a recognizable flower pattern with a green center.\n    *   Output: Correctly extracts the 7x7 region and replaces non-flower pixels with green.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: Contains a flower pattern with a yellow center (4).\n    *   Output: Returns `None` because `find_flower_center` looks specifically for a green center (3). The existing code fails to recognize the flower.\n    *   Expected output: Should have returned the flower pattern centered on (4)\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    *    Input: Flower pattern with center (1)\n    *   Output: Returns `None` because `find_flower_center` looks specifically for a green center (3). The existing code fails to recognize the flower.\n    *   Expected output: Should return the flower pattern centered on (1)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: flower\n    description: A 7x7 pattern with a distinct, symmetrical structure.\n    properties:\n      center:\n        description: The single pixel at the exact center of the flower (at relative coordinates 3,3 within the 7x7 grid).  The center can be any color, except black (0).\n      petal_colors:\n        description: Colors making up the flower's structure around the center. The petals will be a structure around the center.\n      size:\n        description: Always 7x7 pixels.\n    invariants:\n      - The center must exist\n      - There are pixels around the center, forming a shape.\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_flower\n    description: Locate the flower pattern within the larger input grid.\n    preconditions:\n      - A flower object exists in the input.\n    postconditions:\n      - The flower's center coordinates are known.\n\n  - name: extract_flower\n    description: Extract the 7x7 region corresponding to the flower.\n    preconditions:\n      - The flower's center coordinates are known.\n    postconditions:\n      - A 7x7 grid representing the flower is returned.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Flower Center:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. Consider each non-black pixel as a potential flower center.\n2.  **Extract 7x7 Region:** For each potential center, attempt to extract a 7x7 grid centered on that pixel. If the 7x7 grid goes out of bounds, skip this pixel.\n3.  **Validate:** If the center is not black, and the shape returned is 7x7, return it.\n4. **Output:** The flower, a 7x7 section of the input grid.\n\nThe core idea is to locate any 7x7 region with colored center.\n"
