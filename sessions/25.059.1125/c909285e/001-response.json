These objects are made of different colored pixels arranged in specific configurations. The output grids seem to represent a simplified, smaller version of the input, focusing on the core structure of one of these repeated objects. Different background colors create different repeated patterns.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

This can be done by finding a recurring pattern of colors and shapes.\n2. **Extract the Object Core:** Extract a copy of the grid which has the repeated object, removing all noise.\n3. **Create a New Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller output grid. The size should have enough padding to have at least one layer of the object frame.\n4. **Choose Background and Set Border.** The output grid is bordered by pixels of a single color. Select the output color to match the same object frame color, and fill the border.\n5.  **Place Object Core:** Copy the extracted \"core\" object into the output grid, filling the output from top-left to bottom right.\n\nIn summary, the transformation isolates a single instance of the repeating pattern/object found in the input grid and places it on the new output grid bordered by a single color representing the object's frame.\n"
