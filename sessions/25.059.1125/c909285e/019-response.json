            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a subgrid defined by the lowest horizontal line. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. Some examples show different behaviors, including cases where the transformation seems to reconstruct a pattern.\n\nThe primary strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each training example. Pay close attention to discrepancies.\n2.  **Identify Alternative Rules:** Based on the discrepancies, formulate alternative transformation rules that might explain the observed outputs. Consider other objects that could be involved.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect a more general or conditional rule that accounts for the variations across examples.\n4. **Prioritize simple rules**: The rules should only use the core knowledge\n   priors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get more information, I'll use `code_execution` to evaluate the input, predicted output, and expected output.\n\n```tool_code\ndef grid_to_string(grid):\n    if grid is None:\n        return 'None'\n    return '\\n'.join([' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in grid])\n\nfor i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(task.train):\n\n    input_str = grid_to_string(input_grid['input'])\n    expected_str = grid_to_string(expected_output['output'])\n    \n    predicted_output = transform(np.array(input_grid['input']))\n\n    predicted_str = grid_to_string(predicted_output)\n    \n    print(f\"--- Example {i+1} ---\")\n    print(f\"Input:\\n{input_str}\")\n    print(f\"Expected Output:\\n{expected_str}\")\n    print(f\"Predicted Output:\\n{predicted_str}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n```"
