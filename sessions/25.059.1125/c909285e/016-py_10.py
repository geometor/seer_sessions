1.  **Identify Subgrid:** Locate a 7x7 subgrid within the input grid, starting at row 17, column 0. Notice that there is a single horizontal line of magenta pixels at the 17th row from the top and take this entire section.
2.  **Color Transform:** Replace value 5 in the original with 6.
3.  **Output:** The extracted 7x7 subgrid, after the color replacement, is the output.
