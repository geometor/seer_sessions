Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central block:**  Locate the contiguous 4x4 block within the input grid, rows 2-5 and cols 2-5.
2. **Identify the inner block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid, rows 3-4 and cols 3-4.
3.  **Invert Central Block Colors:** Within the 4x4 central block identified in step 1:
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels to white (0).
    *   Change all magenta (6) pixels to orange (7).
4.  **Fill Surrounding Area:** Change all white (0) pixels in the *rest* of the grid (the area *outside* of the 4x4 central block) to magenta (6).
5. The output should be a grid with an outer area of magenta, a 2x2 square of orange, and the balance of the central 4x4 block white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept of a central block and an outer region, with color inversions and filling. However, the row and column indices for the central 4x4 block were off by one (starting at row 1/col 1 instead of 2/2, and therefore, ending at row 4/col 4 instead of row 5/col 5). The code generally performed the correct operations but applied them to the wrong region due to these incorrect boundary conditions.  Additionally, there's an assumption from the training set that the inner 2x2 area will always be orange (7).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Indices:** Update the central block indices to rows 2-5 and cols 2-5 (inclusive). This is the most immediate fix.
2.  **Re-evaluate inner block:** The assumption of the color for the inner block should not be included, remove all reference to it.
3. **Verify Logic with Reports:** Use code execution to generate detailed reports comparing the actual output with the expected output. This will verify if the index correction solves all problems.

**Metrics and Reports (using code execution):**

I will use a simplified version of code execution here, as I do not have the actual `code_execution` environment. I will manually inspect results.

*Example 1:*
Input shape: (7, 8)
Output shape: (7, 8)
Central block identified (expected): Rows 2-5, Cols 2-5
Central block identified (actual): Rows 2-5, Cols 2-5.
Inner block identified (expected): Row 3,4 Cols 3,4

*Example 2:*
Input shape: (7, 8)
Output shape: (7, 8)
Central block identified (expected): Rows 2-5, Cols 2-5
Central block identified (actual): Rows 2-5, Cols 2-5
Inner block identified (expected): Row 3,4 Cols 3,4

*Example 3:*
Input shape: (7, 7)
Output shape: (7, 7)
Central block identified (expected): Rows 2-5, Cols 2-5
Central block identified (actual): Rows 2-5, Cols 2-5.
Inner block identified (expected): Row 3,4 Cols 3,4

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml

  - name: central_block

      start_row: 2

      end_col: 5
    properties:
      color_inversion: true
      orange_to_white: true # all orange becomes white
      magenta_to_orange: true # all magenta becomes orange

  - name: outer_region
    type: area
    description: All pixels outside the central_block.
    properties:
      fill_color: magenta # fill with magenta,
      fill_condition: if original color is white

      start_row: 3
      end_row: 4
      start_col: 3
      end_col: 4
    properties:

actions:
  - target: central_block
    type: color_inversion
    details:
        - from: orange
          to: white
        - from: magenta
          to: orange
  - target: outer_region
    type: fill
    details:

      to: magenta
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central 4x4 block:** Locate the contiguous 4x4 block within the input grid, defined by rows 2-5 (inclusive) and columns 2-5 (inclusive).
2.  **Color Inversion within Central Block:** Within this 4x4 central block:
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels to white (0).
    *   Change all magenta (6) pixels to orange (7).
3.  **Fill Surrounding Area:** Change all white (0) pixels in the region *outside* the 4x4 central block to magenta (6).
4. **Identify inner 2x2 block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid, defined by rows 3-4 (inclusive) and columns 3-4 (inclusive). Note the colors are already correct in this area, so no operation is necessary.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
