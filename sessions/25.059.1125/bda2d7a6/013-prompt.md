Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central 4x4 block:** Locate the contiguous 4x4 block within the input grid, defined by rows 2-5 (inclusive) and columns 2-5 (inclusive).
2.  **Color Inversion within Central Block:** Within this 4x4 central block:
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels to white (0).
    *   Change all magenta (6) pixels to orange (7).
3.  **Fill Surrounding Area:** Change all white (0) pixels in the region *outside* the 4x4 central block to magenta (6).
4. **Identify inner 2x2 block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid, defined by rows 3-4 (inclusive) and columns 3-4 (inclusive). Note the colors are already correct in this area, so no operation is necessary.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
