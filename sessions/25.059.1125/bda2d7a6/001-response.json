Here's a breakdown of my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions.\n*   **Colors:** Each number represents a distinct color. The transformation involves changing colors within the grid.\n*   **Shapes:** The input grids seem to contain a central \"square\" shape of one color, surrounded by another color, and finally enclosed by a border of a third color.  It looks like these inner shapes are swapped.\n*    **Inversion:** The output shows that inside and outside colors get swapped, excluding the outermost border.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
