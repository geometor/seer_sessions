Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid has a distinct pattern: an outer border of green (3), an inner square of red (2), and a central square of white (0). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, where the white (0) pixels in the center are removed, and their place is taken by surrounding colors in a layered approach. The colors are shifted inwards.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2, 3] # White, Red, Green
      - dimensions: 6x6

  - name: outer_border
    type: region
    properties:
      - color: 3 # Green
      - location: perimeter of the grid

  - name: inner_square
    type: region
    properties:
      - color: 2 # Red
      - location: inside the outer border

  - name: central_square
    type: region
    properties:
      - color: 0 # White
      - location: center of the grid

actions:
  - name: shift_inward
    description: Colors from the outer layers move inwards to fill the void left by removing the central square.
  - name: replace
    description: replace existing colors

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the layers:** Recognize the different colored regions in the input grid: the outer green border, the red inner square, and the central white square.
2.  **Remove the center:** Eliminate the central white square (color 0).
3.  **Shift Inwards:** Move the colors from surrounding to the place previous occupied by the central white square.
4.  **Blank the perimeter:** Set all pixels on the grid's outermost border to white (0).

In essence, the transformation "removes" the center and causes the surrounding colors to shift inwards, filling the void, while blanking the perimeter.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
