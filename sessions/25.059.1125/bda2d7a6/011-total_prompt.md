Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central block:**  Locate the contiguous 4x4 block within the input grid, rows 2-5 and cols 2-5.
2. **Identify the inner block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid, rows 3-4 and cols 3-4.
3.  **Invert Central Block Colors:** Within the 4x4 central block identified in step 1:
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels to white (0).
    *   Change all magenta (6) pixels to orange (7).
4.  **Fill Surrounding Area:** Change all white (0) pixels in the *rest* of the grid (the area *outside* of the 4x4 central block) to magenta (6).
5. The output should be a grid with an outer area of magenta, a 2x2 square of orange, and the balance of the central 4x4 block white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
