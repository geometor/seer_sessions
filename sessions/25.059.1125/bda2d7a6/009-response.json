The input grid contains a central block of orange (7) and magenta (6) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid appears to be an \"inversion\" of the input.  The central block is transformed, and the surrounding white pixels are replaced with magenta (6). It seems like a color swap or fill operation based on the initial configuration. The inner 2x2 magenta square becomes orange, while the surrounding orange rectangle becomes white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
