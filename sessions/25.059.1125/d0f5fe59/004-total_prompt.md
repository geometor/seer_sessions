Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a larger grid (input) to a smaller grid (output). The primary color involved is azure (8), with the background being white (0). The input grid contains scattered azure shapes, while the output grid seems to represent a condensed or abstracted version of the input, focusing only on the azure pixels. The relative positions of azure are different between input and output. It seems that a diagonal sequence from the top left is important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [16, 10]
        elements: [0, 8]
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [4, 4]
        elements: [0, 8]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: azure
        value: 8

actions:
  - name: condense
    description: Reduce the grid size while preserving certain pixel information.
  - name: select
    description: extracts specific elements based on position and color.

relationships:
  - subject: input_grid
    relation: transformed_to
    object: output_grid
  - subject: azure_pixels
    relation: selected_from
    object: input_grid
  - subject: selected_pixels
    relation: arranged_in
    object: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Select**: Select the azure colored pixels along a top-left to bottom-right diagonal. Starting from the top-left most azure, we pick them at increasing distances, and each successive selected azure is to the bottom-right of the last selected one. If there is no such azure to the bottom-right, stop.
3. **Create**: Create a new, smaller 4x4 output grid.
4. **Arrange**: Fill the output grid with the selected pixels. Place the first azure pixel found in the top-left corner (0,0) of the output. Place the next selected azure in the next diagonal position (1,1). Continue placing azures, each in the next bottom-right diagonal position, until either no more azures are found, or the bottom-right corner of the output is reached. Fill the rest of the output grid with the background color (white, 0).

Essentially, the program extracts a diagonal sequence of azure pixels from the input, starting from the top-left and going down. It creates a new grid based on those selected pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
