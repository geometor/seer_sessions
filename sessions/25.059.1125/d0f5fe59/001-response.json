The azure pixels appear to form distinct objects, while the white pixels represent the background. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids and seem to contain a condensed representation of the azure objects. The positioning of the azure pixels in the output grid appears to be related to the relative position of distinct azure colored \"objects\" within the original image, specifically the \"corners\".\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A distinct object is defined as a contiguous block of azure pixels.\n\n2.  **Determine Object Corners/Extremities:** From the set of input images, we can see a \"staircase pattern\" of the azure objects.\n\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a number of rows equal to number of rows where at least one distinct object in the original object is present in the \"staircase\" and a number of columns equals to the number of columns that contain an object in the original \"staircase\".\n\n4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Starting from the top left, create azure colored pixels in the correct relative position.\n    - row 1 corresponds to the first row where a distinct azure object appears, following the staircase pattern\n    - column 1 correspond to the first column where a distinct azure object appears following the staircase pattern\n\nIn other words, the output grid represents the relative diagonal positions of the azure objects by a single azure pixel, essentially creating a \"diagonal\" representation of the objects.\n"
