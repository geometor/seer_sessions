- object: azure_diagonal
  description: A sequence of azure pixels extending diagonally from the top-left or other starting points.
  properties:
    - length: The number of contiguous azure pixels in the diagonal.
    - start_position: The (row, column) coordinates of the first azure pixel in the diagonal.
    - end_position: The (row, column) coordinates of the last azure pixel in the diagonal.

- object: input_grid
  description: The initial grid of pixels.
  properties:
    - dimensions: The (rows, columns) of the grid.
    - color_counts: The number of pixels of each color.

- object: output_grid
  description: The transformed grid of pixels.
  properties:
    - dimensions: The (rows, columns) of the grid.
    - color_counts: The number of pixels of each color.

- action: extract_diagonal
  description: Identifies the longest continuous diagonal of azure pixels.
  input: input_grid
  output: azure_diagonal

- action: create_output_grid
  description: Generates an output grid, with dimensions that have a complex dependency on azure diagonal, sometimes matching its length or being limited to a maximum size of 4x4, or the full input if all pixels on the input are azure.
  input: azure_diagonal, input_grid
  output: output_grid

- action: populate_output_diagonal
  description: Fills some or all pixels of main diagonal of the output grid.
    - When the azure diagonal length is less than 4, a 2x2 diagonal is filled with azure.
    - When length is three or greater, the diagonal has up to 4 azure pixels.
  input: output_grid, azure_diagonal
  output: output_grid
