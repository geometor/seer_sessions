**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing two colors: white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels appear to form distinct objects, while the white pixels represent the background. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids and seem to contain a condensed representation of the azure objects. The positioning of the azure pixels in the output grid appears to be related to the relative position of distinct azure colored "objects" within the original image, specifically the "corners".

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - cell_values: [0, 8]
      - color_0: white
      - color_8: azure
  - object_type: azure_object
    properties:
      - shape: irregular
      - connectivity: contiguous_block
    actions:
      - identify_corners: Find the relative positions of azure objects
      - condense: Represent the azure objects in smaller space.
  - relationships:
      - input_grid_contains: multiple azure_objects
      - output_grid_represents: relative position of azure objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all distinct azure (8) colored objects within the input grid. A distinct object is defined as a contiguous block of azure pixels.

2.  **Determine Object Corners/Extremities:** From the set of input images, we can see a "staircase pattern" of the azure objects.

3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a number of rows equal to number of rows where at least one distinct object in the original object is present in the "staircase" and a number of columns equals to the number of columns that contain an object in the original "staircase".

4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Starting from the top left, create azure colored pixels in the correct relative position.
    - row 1 corresponds to the first row where a distinct azure object appears, following the staircase pattern
    - column 1 correspond to the first column where a distinct azure object appears following the staircase pattern

In other words, the output grid represents the relative diagonal positions of the azure objects by a single azure pixel, essentially creating a "diagonal" representation of the objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
