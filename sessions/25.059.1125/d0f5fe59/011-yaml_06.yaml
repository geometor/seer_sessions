    actions:
      - action: downscale
        description: >
          The input grid is downscaled to the output grid by dividing it into
          4x4 non-overlapping regions.  Each region in the input grid corresponds
          to a single pixel in the output grid.
      - action: check_azure
        description: >
          For each 4x4 region in the input, the corresponding output pixel is set
          to azure (8) if *any* pixel within the region is azure. Otherwise, the
          output pixel is set to white (0).
      - action: map_region_to_pixel
        description: >
          Maps a 4x4 region of the input grid to a single pixel in the output grid.
          The mapping is determined by integer division of the output grid indices
          by 4.  Specifically, output pixel (r, c) corresponds to the input region
          with top-left corner at (r*4, c*4).
