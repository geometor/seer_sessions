facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - feature: horizontal_band
        description: A contiguous sequence of non-zero values in a single row.
        properties:
          - start_column: index of the first non-zero value
          - end_column: index of the last non-zero value
          - length: number of non-zero value pixels (end_column - start_column + 1)
          - row_index: the row containing the band
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - width: 2 * input_band_length + 2
      - feature: mirrored horizontal band.
        description: The input band sequence of colors is duplicated.
  - transformation:
      - description: The input grid's horizontal band is extended by doubling it's width and adding a padding of 0 at the beginning and at the end.
