The grids contain numerical values representing different colors. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2).  The input grid has dimensions 5x8, while output grid appears to have grown in both dimensions. The core pattern of blue and red seems to be retained and expanded, while the surrounding white area also expands.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
