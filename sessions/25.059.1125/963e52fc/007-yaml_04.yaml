  objects:
    - name: Grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - role: Input and Output container
    - name: ColoredBlock
      properties:
        - type: Contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels within a row
        - values: Varies (non-zero color values)
        - behavior: Replicated and appended to itself
  actions:
    - name: Replicate
      input: ColoredBlock
      output: Doubled ColoredBlock
      description: Copies the ColoredBlock and appends the copy to the original block.
    - name: TransformRow
      input: Single row of the input grid
      output: Transformed row of the output grid.
      description: >
        If the row contains only zeros (white), it doubles the row width with zeros.
        If the row contains a ColoredBlock, it identifies the block, replicates it,
        and creates a new row by concatenating the original sequence up to the end of the colored block, and the replicated block.
    - name: Extend White
      input: Single row of the input grid consisting of zeros
      output: extended row with zeros
      description: double the width with zeros
  transformation_rule: >
    The width of the grid is doubled.  Each row is processed independently.
    Rows containing only zeros (white) are extended. Rows with colored pixels have the
    contiguous non-zero colored block identified, replicated, and appended to the end
    of the original colored block.
