Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid appears to have a single horizontal line of alternating red and green pixels, while the surrounding pixels are white. The output grid seems to be an expansion of this line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
