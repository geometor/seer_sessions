Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input grid appears to be transformed into a wider output grid. The core pattern seems to be a replication of the central colored rows (red and azure) horizontally. The white rows remain unchanged in height but are extended in width.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 5
      - width: 6
      - values: [0, 2, 8]
      - color_map: {0: white, 2: red, 8: azure}
    observations:
      - "Rows 1 and 2 (0-indexed) contain alternating values of 2 and 8."
      - "Rows 0, 3, and 4 contain only the value 0."

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 5
      - width: 12
      - values: [0, 2, 8]
      - color_map: {0: white, 2: red, 8: azure}
    observations:
      - "Rows 1 and 2 (0-indexed) contain alternating values of 2 and 8, repeated from the input."
      - "Rows 0, 3, and 4 contain only the value 0."
    relationship:
      - "The width of the output_grid is double the width of the input_grid."
      - "Colored rows (1 and 2) in the input_grid are replicated horizontally in the output_grid."
      - "White rows (0, 3, and 4) of the input are extended, not replicated."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Core:** Locate the rows containing non-zero values in the input grid. In this case, rows 1 and 2 (index 0 and 1).
2.  **Replicate Core:** Duplicate these identified rows horizontally to double their width.
3.  **Extend Whitespace:** Take the rows consisting only of 0s (whitespace). Extend them, by doubling the number of '0' in those rows.
4.  **Assemble Output:** Combine the extended whitespace rows and the replicated core rows, maintaining the original vertical order, to form the output grid. The output grid will have the same height as the input but double the width.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
