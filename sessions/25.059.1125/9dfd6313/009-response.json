The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary change seems to be the movement and/or replacement of certain colored pixels. Specifically, the magenta (6) and yellow(4) pixels appear to have changed positions relative to the gray(5) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
