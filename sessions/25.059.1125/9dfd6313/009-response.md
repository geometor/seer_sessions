Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 4x4 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary change seems to be the movement and/or replacement of certain colored pixels. Specifically, the magenta (6) and yellow(4) pixels appear to have changed positions relative to the gray(5) pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    description: Input and output grids containing colored pixels.

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [0, 4, 5, 6]  # white, yellow, gray, magenta
      position:
        type: coordinates
        values: (row, col)

actions:
  - type: movement
    description: Some pixels seem to have moved from input to output, changing positions.
    affected_objects: [pixel]
  - type: replacement
    description: it appears as though pixels have changed their value (color)
    affected_objects: [pixel]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relationship between non-zero pixels in output is a 90 degree clockwise rotation compared to input
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
2.  **Rotation around Gray:** consider that the non-zero pixels are rotating.
3.  **Find Center**: compute the centroid using the average row and average
    column of these identified pixels.
4.  **Relative Positions:** express the relationship of these pixels to that
    point.
5.  **Rotation:** the relative positions rotate 90 degrees clockwise.
6.  **Value exchange.** the values of the non-zero pixels move to their new
    positions.

In simpler terms: The non-white pixels are changing their positions based on a 90 degree clockwise rotation centered around the gray pixels. The values are copied into their new locations.
