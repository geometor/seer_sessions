Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The transformation appears to rearrange and possibly combine non-zero values within the grid, with a particular focus on how '5's are handled and how other non-zero digits relate to them. There's no apparent rotation or reflection. The key seems to be the relative positions of non-zero pixels and how columns of the input are transformed.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These columns, and their original order, will remain fixed in the output.\n\n2.  **Process Non-'5' Columns:** For each of the remaining columns in *input*, scanning from left to right, gather all non-zero values into a list, maintaining their original top-to-bottom order.\n\n3.  **Place Non-'5' Values:** Beginning with the first column *after* the last '5' column in the *output*, begin filling in the non-zero lists created in step 2. Each list of non-zero values is placed top-to-bottom in the first available column of the *output*.\n\n4. **Fill Remaining Cells:** The remaining cells, if any, of the output grid are then filled by `0`.\n\nIn summary, the input to output transformation moves the columns with `5` to their correct place in the output, and then compacts all the non-zero numbers in the remaining input columns into the remaining columns in the output.\n"
