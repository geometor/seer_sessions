**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The transformation appears to rearrange and possibly combine non-zero values within the grid, with a particular focus on how '5's are handled and how other non-zero digits relate to them. There's no apparent rotation or reflection. The key seems to be the relative positions of non-zero pixels and how columns of the input are transformed.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of digits.
  - type: cell_values
    description: Cell values range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Non-zero pixels can be considered individual objects.
  - type: object_interaction
    description: Non-zero pixels interact based on their column positions.
    details: |
        '5' valued pixels form an "anchor".
        other color pixels that are non-zero and non-5 values move as left as they can to the
        first available column after the columns occupied by '5' values.
        multiple values in the same column on input are combined in order from top to bottom
  - type: transformation
    description: Column-based rearrangement and merging of non-zero values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '5' Anchors:** Find all columns in the input grid that contain the value '5'.  These columns, and their original order, will remain fixed in the output.

2.  **Process Non-'5' Columns:** For each of the remaining columns in *input*, scanning from left to right, gather all non-zero values into a list, maintaining their original top-to-bottom order.

3.  **Place Non-'5' Values:** Beginning with the first column *after* the last '5' column in the *output*, begin filling in the non-zero lists created in step 2. Each list of non-zero values is placed top-to-bottom in the first available column of the *output*.

4. **Fill Remaining Cells:** The remaining cells, if any, of the output grid are then filled by `0`.

In summary, the input to output transformation moves the columns with `5` to their correct place in the output, and then compacts all the non-zero numbers in the remaining input columns into the remaining columns in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
