The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5 in this example). There's a noticeable shift and potential combination of certain colored pixels, while others seem to disappear or remain unchanged. The primary colors involved appear to be gray (5), azure (8), red (2), and blue (1), with white (0) acting as a background.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
