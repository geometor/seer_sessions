The original green has moved down and to the left.\n*   The pattern of colored pixels in the bottom right of the input and output is similar:\n    - Input: three orange(7) and a blue (1) in the shape of a cross\n    - Output: same cross, but the original blue(1) has moved up one.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n2.  **Move 3 clusters down and to the left:** For the green(3) cluster identified, the output's colored pixels is one down, one left.\n3.  **Maintain relative position:** The final position of the cluster is that a new cell with value `3` is placed on each side of the green(3) cell.\n4. Move one up. For the cross shape of three 7 and a single 1, the output is moved one cell up.\n5.  **Maintain relative position:** The final position of the cluster is that it maintains the relative position of the cross.\n6.  **Clear other pixels:** All cells that are not part of a moved cross are set to 0.\n\nIn summary, we move the first non-zero value down and to the left one, and the blue in the cross of non-zero digits up by one. Any holes created by the moves are filled by the background (0).\n"
