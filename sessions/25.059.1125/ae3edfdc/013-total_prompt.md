Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Objects: Locate all orange (7) and blue (1) pixels within the input grid. Empty cells are 0.
2. Orange Expansion: Orange pixels expand into adjacent (up, down, left, right) empty (0) pixels.
3. Expansion Target: The expansion of orange pixels is directed towards blue pixels.
4. Stopping Condition: Orange expansion continues until there is no empty cell between an orange and blue pixel in any straight line (up/down and left/right). In other words, each blue pixel should have an adjacent orange pixel.
5. Immovable Objects: Blue pixels, and any other non-orange and non-empty pixels, do not change their positions or colors. The orange will grow *around* other non-empty, non-blue pixels.
6. Empty Cells: Empty Cells (value 0) between orange and blue are replaced with orange until condition 4 is met.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
