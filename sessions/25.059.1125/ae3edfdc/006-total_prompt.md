Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and overall approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and correctly identified the movement of the green (3) and cross-shaped orange(7)/blue(1) clusters. However, it made assumptions that do not hold true for all examples. Specifically, it assumed that:

1.  Only one green cluster would exist.
2.  A green cell is placed two positions to the right of *any* 2 value after the main green cluster has moved.
3.  All orange/blue crosses will behave identically.
4.  Clusters that were not part of the explicitly handled green or orange/blue logic should not move from their original positions.

The test results across all training examples reveal that these assumptions are incorrect. The updated strategy is as follows:

1.  **Generalize Cluster Handling:** Instead of hardcoding the behavior for specific colors, detect cluster *types* and apply transformations based on properties like shape, not only color.
2.  **Contextualize Transformations:** The placement of new pixels or the movement of existing ones is dependent on the surrounding context, not just the color. Examine adjacent cells.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic after each example, further refining the rules based on the observed discrepancies.

**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` to validate)**

I'll use print statements to inspect the intermediate `output_grid` after each main step (green cluster movement, cross movement, other cluster handling) to understand where deviations occur. Since I do not have iterative `code_execution` I will be inspecting grids manually.

*Example 0 (Correct):*
- Green cluster moves down-left; a new green cell is correctly placed.
- Orange/blue cross moves up.
- Result: Correct.

*Example 1 (Incorrect):*
- Two green clusters exist.
- Green clusters do not combine.
- Result: Incorrect placement of additional green cell after moving first green cluster

*Example 2 (Incorrect):*
- a green cluster moves down-left.
- a new green cell is placed correctly to the right.
- There is an orange/blue/orange T shape, instead of a cross shape. It does not appear to move.
- Result: Incorrect - the T did not move, but other parts moved incorrectly.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml

  objects:
    - type: cluster
      color: green
      shape: irregular
      initial_position: (0, 2)
      action: move_down_left

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Clusters:** Identify all contiguous clusters of non-zero pixels.
2.  **Green Cluster Rule:**
    *   For each green (3) cluster:
        *   Move the entire cluster down one row and left one column.
        *   Find red (2) pixels that were part of the moved green cluster.
        *   Place a new green (3) pixel one cell to the *right* of each of those red pixels, if that position is within the grid boundaries.

3. **Cross Shaped Cluster Rule:** If a cluster is a cross-shape made of orange(7) and blue(1) cells, move the whole cluster up one row.
4. **T Shaped Cluster:** If a cluster is a "T" shape made of orange(7) and blue(1), do not move.
5. **Other clusters**: Clusters that don't match either of the rules above are ignored.

Key improvements in the natural language program:

*   Explicitly handles multiple green clusters.
*   Clarifies the relative placement of the new green pixel (adjacent to red pixels that were *part* of moved green cluster).
*   Introduces logic for T-shaped clusters.
*   Includes a rule to avoid changing other shapes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
