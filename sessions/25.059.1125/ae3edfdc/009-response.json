The primary focus seems to be on the spatial relationships and potential interactions/transformations of colored pixels within the grid. There appear to be a few key colors involved other than the background (0/white): 1 (blue), 7 (orange), 2 (red), and 3 (green). The transformation seems to involve a combination of movement, replication, and deletion of these colored pixels. The orange (7) seems to play a central role, appearing to extend towards, or perhaps be attracted to, the blue (1) pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It appears only orthogonal moves are applied, not diagonal.\n\n4.  **Other Pixels:** The red (2) and green (3) pixels appear unchanged, except possible displacement if orange expanded into them. They may get shifted, but not altered in color or deleted. The input shows orange replacing green in its replication path.\n\n5. **Output Grid:** The final output grid reflects the state after the orange expansion. All other colored pixels and white space remain in the locations to where they might have been displaced.\n"
