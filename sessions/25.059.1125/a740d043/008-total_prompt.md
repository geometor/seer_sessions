Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Find the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all non-blue pixels within the input grid. This determines the "region of interest".
2.  **Extract and Reproduce:** Create a new grid with dimensions matching the bounding box. Copy all pixels (including blue pixels) from the input grid's region of interest to the corresponding locations in the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_non_blue_region(grid):
    # Find coordinates of non-blue pixels
    non_blue_coords = np.argwhere(grid != 1)
    return non_blue_coords

def get_bounding_box(coords):
    # Get the min and max row and col to define the bounding box

    if len(coords) == 0 : # special case of no non-blue pixels

    else :

        for j in range(output_width):

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code focuses on extracting a region of interest based on non-blue pixels. This approach works for the first example but fails on subsequent examples where the logic is different. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis is too specific and doesn't generalize. We need to shift our focus from "non-blue" to a more general concept that can encompass all the training examples. The second and third examples include all colors in their output. They appear to copy portions of the original image and change the location.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the relationships between them. Pay close attention to what's copied, moved, or changed.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for common operations or rules that apply across multiple examples, even if the specific colors or shapes differ.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Formulate a revised program that accounts for the observed patterns and addresses the failures of the previous code. I expect I will need to use more general terms.
4.  **Metrics and YAML:** I'll use code execution to obtain precise details for each example like input/output dimensions, colors used, and any transformations (translation, rotation, scaling). This information will feed into the YAML fact documentation.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
