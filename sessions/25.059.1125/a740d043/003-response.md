Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 5x7 grid (matrix) of single-digit integers (colors). The dominant color is blue (1), with a small cluster of red (2) and a single green (3) pixel.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It contains red (2), green (3), and white (0) pixels. The output appears to be a condensed or abstracted representation of the input's central non-blue region.
*  The relative position of non-blue pixels are maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x7
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    dominant_color: 1 (blue)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    colors_present: [0, 2, 3]
  - name: red_cluster
    type: object
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: contiguous block
    input_location: approximately centered
  - name: green_pixel
    type: object
    color: 3 (green)
    shape: single pixel
    input_location: adjacent to red_cluster, right of red_cluster
  - name: zero_pixels
    type: object
    color: 0
    shape: single pixel
    input_location: corners

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Isolates a region of the input grid.
  - name: map_colors
    description: retains/changes color in subgrid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains red_cluster
  - input_grid contains green_pixel
  - red_cluster is adjacent to green_pixel
  - output_grid represents a transformed version of the central region of the input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-blue region:** Locate the contiguous block of non-blue (non-1) pixels within the input grid. This region appears to be roughly centered.
2.  **Define Subgrid:** The area to be transformed is at most a 3x3.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
4.  **Translate to new grid:** The relative position of colored pixels that are not blue are perserved.
5. **Color changes** All blue pixels are changed to white.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the smallest subgrid of the input that has the dimensions of 3x3. All blue pixels become white.
