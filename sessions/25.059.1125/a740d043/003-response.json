The dominant color is blue (1), with a small cluster of red (2) and a single green (3) pixel.\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It contains red (2), green (3), and white (0) pixels. The output appears to be a condensed or abstracted representation of the input's central non-blue region.\n*  The relative position of non-blue pixels are maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
