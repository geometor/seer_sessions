**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids predominantly consist of '1' (blue) pixels, with a few pixels of other colors forming distinct shapes. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining only the non-blue pixels and sometimes the 0 (white) pixels, from the input grid, while changing the size and shape.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [blue, red, green, magenta, gray, white] # Values representing these colors.
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x7, 7x7, 7x6)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [red, green, magenta, gray, white] # Values representing these colors
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3, 2x3, 3x2)
  - name: non_blue_object
    type: object
    properties:
      - colors: [red, green, magenta, gray]
      - shape: variable (contiguous block)
      - position: variable (within input_grid)
  - name: white_object
     type: object
     properties:
        - colors: [white]
        - shape: variable
        - position: variable

actions:
  - name: extract_non_blue
    description: Identify and isolate non-blue colored objects within the input grid.
  - name: resize_and_reposition
    description: Create a new grid, smaller than the input, containing the extracted colored parts.
  - name: consider_white:
      description: consider if 0 (white) values are included

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_blue_object
  - output_grid represents non_blue_object (and maybe white_object) from input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Blue Objects:** Examine the input grid and locate all contiguous blocks of pixels that are *not* blue (value 1). These blocks can be of any shape and color other than blue.
2. **Consider White Objects:** Examine if the output grid includes white colored pixels (value 0). White pixels might be included between the extracted objects.
3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions of this grid are not fixed but are determined by the arrangement of the identified non-blue (and possibly white) objects.
4. **Populate Output Grid:** Transfer the non-blue (and white) objects from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining the original shape/colors of each extracted parts. Arrange those parts such that any gaps between the non-blue pixels in the input are closed.

In simple terms: the input shows some non-blue clusters surrounded by blue. Copy all non-blue clusters to a smaller plate, discarding all blue pixels (and maybe keeping white ones), and make a new figure using copied clusters.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
