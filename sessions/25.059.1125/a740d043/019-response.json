The primary issue is that the initial program assumed the orange pixel would *always* have a 2x2 neighborhood that could be extracted without going out of bounds. The failures indicate that the orange pixel can be located near the edges of the input grid, leading to index errors when trying to extract a 2x2 block.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n\n1. **Check Boundaries:** Before extracting the 2x2 block, verify that the orange pixel's coordinates allow for a 2x2 extraction without exceeding the grid boundaries.\n2. **Handle Edge Cases:** If a 2x2 block cannot be extracted, determine a suitable alternative.  The current code returns an empty grid.  Based on example 3, if we can't get a 2x2 block, we take what is available in the row and column.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` to get precise details about the grid dimensions and orange pixel locations. This will inform the YAML facts and natural language program.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_orange_pixel(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates of the orange pixel (color 7).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 7:\n                return (r, c)\n    return None\n\ndef analyze_examples(examples):\n    results = []\n    for i, example in enumerate(examples):\n        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n        orange_pixel_coords = find_orange_pixel(input_grid)\n        \n        result = {\n            'example_index': i,\n            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,\n            'output_shape': output_grid.shape,\n            'orange_pixel_coords': orange_pixel_coords,\n        }\n        results.append(result)\n    return results\n\n# Assuming 'task' is defined elsewhere and contains the examples\nexample_results = analyze_examples(task['train'])\nprint(example_results)\n\n```"
