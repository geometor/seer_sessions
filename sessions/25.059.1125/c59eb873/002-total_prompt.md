**Perception of Elements:**

The core element seems to be the replication of the input grid to create a larger output grid. The input grid's dimensions are doubled in both width and height in the output. Each pixel in the input grid is seemingly expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - colors: [0-9] # Integer values representing colors
        - width: variable
        - height: variable
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - colors: [0-9]
        - width: 2 * input_grid.width
        - height: 2 * input_grid.height
actions:
  - replicate:
      input: input_grid pixel
      output: 2x2 block in output_grid
      properties:
        - color: same as input pixel
relationships:
  - output_grid: contains replicated 2x2 blocks of each input_grid pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  For every pixel in the input, **create** a 2x2 block in the output grid.
3.  The 2x2 block's **position** in the output grid corresponds to the input pixel's position, scaled by a factor of 2.
4.  All four pixels within the 2x2 block have the **same color** as the original input pixel.
5. The result will be twice as wide and tall.

In simpler terms the transformation can also be defined as:
The input grid is doubled in size, along both the horizontal and vertical axis, resulting in output that is increased on both dimensions x2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
