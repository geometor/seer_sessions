Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe primary elements are:\n\n*   **Pixels:** Individual cells in the grid, represented by digits 0-9, corresponding to different colors.\n*   **Grid:** A 2D array of pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   **Colors:** The input grid uses primarily azure (8) and white (0). The output grid introduces green (3) while retaining azure and white.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Find all white\n    pixels inside this bounding box, if any, that are adjacent to any azure\n    pixel of the current region, replace these white pixels with green (3).\n    Pixels are adjacent side by side or diagonally.\n\nIn summary the rule replaces white pixels in regions enclosed by connected azure\npixels with green pixels, but only those white pixels that are also adjacent to\nazure pixels.\n"
