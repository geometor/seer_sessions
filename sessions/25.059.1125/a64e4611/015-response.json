            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, capturing the basic idea of filling horizontal white spaces with green. However, the extension to the right edge of the image, unconditionally if the row starts with green (value 3) is incorrect. The filling should stop when encountering a red pixel (value 2). The examples clearly demonstrate this behavior. The code over-extends the fill. We need to modify filling behavior to only extend if not blocked by red.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output and the actual output of the `transform` function. I will leverage my ability to visually process the image to derive these metrics, and use the results to define a more complete YAML block and program.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A single horizontal line of white pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: A single horizontal line of green pixels.\n    *   Actual Output: Correct.\n    *   Observation: The basic horizontal fill works.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Multiple horizontal lines, some with red pixels interrupting white spaces.\n    *   Expected Output: Green fills the white spaces between the red pixels, and fills to the edge if no blocking red pixel.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect. Extends all green fills to end.\n    *   Observation: The red pixels correctly stop the *initial* fill, but the conditional extension based purely on starting with color 3 in the first column is incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: Similar to example 2, with different arrangements of red and white pixels.\n    *    Expected Output: Green filling between and around red blocks, and if the fill reaches the edge.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect. Same error as example 2.\n    *   Observation: Further confirms that the filling logic needs adjustment when a row starts with green, and must consider intermediate red pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    description: A 2D array of pixels.\n    properties:\n      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.\n      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.\n      - cells: Individual pixels within the grid.\n  - name: pixel\n    description: A single cell in the grid.\n    properties:\n      - color: A numerical value representing the pixel's color (0-9).\n      - row: The row index of the pixel.\n      - col: The column index of the pixel.\n  - name: horizontal_run\n    description: contiguous block of pixels of same color in a row\n    properties:\n      - color: color of pixels\n      - start: (row, col) of leftmost pixel\n      - end: (row, col) of rightmost pixel\n\nactions:\n  - name: fill\n    description: Change the color of pixels in a horizontal run.\n    parameters:\n      - start_color: initial color in run\n      - end_color: final color\n      - blocking_color: color which stops filling\n    constraints:\n        - filling begins when a pixel matching `start_color` is encountered\n        - filling stops when a pixel matching `blocking_color` is encountered\n        - filling applies only within a single row.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Iterate through each row** of the input grid.\n2.  **Within each row, scan from left to right.**\n3.  **Identify contiguous horizontal runs of white pixels (color 0).**\n4.  **For each identified run:**\n    *   **Begin filling** the run with green pixels (color 3).\n    *  **Stop filling** if a red pixel (color 2) is encountered.\n    * **Continue filling** to the right end of row if started and not blocked by red.\n\nThe crucial change from the previous version is the clear condition on when to stop filling to the right. The prior version always filled to the edge.\n"
