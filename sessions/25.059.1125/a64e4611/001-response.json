The transformation seems to involve adding a new color (3, green) to the output grid based on some pattern present in the input grid. The patterns seem to fill areas defined, at least partially, by color '0' (white). There is an 'objectness' to blocks of the color. It appears color '8' is unchanged, perhaps bounding or background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The filled area includes any color 0 pixels. The filled area also connects regions of other colors.\n3. **Boundary Conditions:** Color 8 pixels act as a boundary, not filled by color 3\n4. **Output:** Create a new output grid that is the same size as input grid and has same content except, the fill color of 3 will have replace color 0 pixels.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies regions of 0 and fills them and the regions between other colors with color 3, bounded by color 8.\n"
