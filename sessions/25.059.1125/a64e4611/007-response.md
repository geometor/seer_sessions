Okay, I've examined the input and output grids for the `train_2` example pair. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are:

*   **Pixels:** Individual cells in the grid with values from 0-9, representing colors.
*   **Input Grid:** A 30x30 grid of pixels.
*   **Output Grid:** Another 30x30 grid of pixels.
*   **Colors:** The input uses two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The output introduces a third color: green (3).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_region
    type: region
    color: blue (1)
    description: Areas of connected blue pixels.
  - name: white_region
    type: region
    color: white (0)
    description: Areas of connected white pixels.
    
  - name: green_rectangle
    type: shape
    color: green(3)
    description: solid green rectangle

actions:
  - name: fill
    agent: system
    target: white_region
    description: Fills select areas of the grid that are white
    color: green(3)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    object1: blue_region
    object2: white_region
    description: Blue and white regions share borders.

  - type: enclosure
    object1: blue_region
    object2: background
    description: The shape made by the blue pixels is enclosed in the white background

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify a rectangular region:** Find a rectangular section in the upper-left of the output grid where all white (0) pixels in the input grid are replaced by green (3) pixels, while blue (1) pixels remain unchanged.
2.  **Extend to full rows and columns:** find where the blue pixels are enclosed in the white background, find columns and rows that extend to the edge of the largest connected shapes.
3. **Fill with Green**: the white space in these rows and colums is all replaced with the new color

In summary, the transformation identifies select areas of contiguous white pixels, and fills with green. The key seems to be in identifying the largest area.
