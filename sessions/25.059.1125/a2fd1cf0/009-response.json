Both grids are 10x16 and contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grid appears mostly empty (filled with 0, or white), with a single green pixel (3) and a single red pixel (2) in seemingly arbitrary locations. The output grid retains the green pixel in the same location, expands the red pixel into a horizontal line of azure pixels (8), and adds azure (8) pixels vertically upwards from the horizontal line, until the height of green pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
