1. Locate the green (3) pixel in the input grid and copy it to the same location in the output grid.
2. Locate the red (2) pixel in the input grid.
3. In the output grid, at the same position of red pixel, create horizontal a line of azure (8) pixels extending to the right. The horizontal line ends in the column before the green pixel.
4. Create a vertical line of azure (8) pixel, starting from the position of the last azure pixel of the horizontal line. This line extends vertically upwards until the row above the green pixel.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
