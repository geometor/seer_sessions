Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the red (2) pixel and the green (3) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Segment:** Starting at the red pixel's location, draw a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels extending in the direction of the green pixel.  The horizontal line stops in the column before (or after, if the green is to the left) the green pixel.
3.  **Vertical Segment:** From the last azure pixel of the horizontal segment, draw a vertical line of azure (8) pixels extending in the direction of the green pixel. The line stops in the same row as the green pixel.
4. The red and green pixels must remain with their original color values.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
