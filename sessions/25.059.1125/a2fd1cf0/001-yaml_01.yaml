    description: >
      Draws a path of color '8' (azure) between the 'start_pixel' and
      'end_pixel'. The path is rectilinear (only horizontal and vertical
      segments). The starting point is always the red pixel.
    constraints:
      - Path consists of adjacent pixels (no diagonals).
      - path includes both the start and end pixels
      - the path can be of different lengths, but in each case here, it is the shortest path

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [start_pixel, end_pixel]
    description: >
      'start_pixel' and 'end_pixel' are located at different positions
      within the grid.
  - type: connectivity
    between: [start_pixel, end_pixel, path_pixel]
    description: >
      'path_pixels' form a continuous, unbroken connection between
      'start_pixel' and 'end_pixel'.
