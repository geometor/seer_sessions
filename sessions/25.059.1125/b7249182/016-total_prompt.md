Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary difference lies in the arrangement and presence of non-zero values. The input grid seems sparse, with only two non-zero pixels, while the output grid has an expanded, cross-like shape formed from the original non-zero pixels. The colors of the original pixels are maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: gray_pixel
    color: gray # Value 5
    initial_position: [5, 3] # (row, col) in input grid
    shape: single pixel

  - id: azure_pixel
    color: azure # Value 8
    initial_position: [5, 16]
    shape: single pixel

  - id: gray_cross
    color: gray
    shape: cross
    center: [5, 3] # of input grid

    
  - id: azure_cross
    color: azure
    shape: cross
    center: [5, 16] #of input grid

actions:
  - type: expand
    agent: gray_pixel
    target: gray_cross
    description: "The gray pixel expands outwards, forming horizontal and vertical lines of gray, creating the cross shape"

  - type: expand
    agent: azure_pixel
    target: azure_cross
    description: "The azure pixel expands to form a horizontal and vertical lines, a cross shape"
    
relations:
  - type: alignment
    object1: gray_cross
    object2: azure_cross
    description: "The centers of the output crosses is at same relative position of the original single pixels"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.
2.  **Create Crosses:** For each non-zero pixel:
    *   Create a cross shape centered at the pixel's original location.
    *   Extend a horizontal line and a vertical line, both composed of pixels of the *same color* as the original pixel.
    *   The output crosses are of fixed height/width of 3 pixels.

The cross is formed by 3 horizontal and 3 vertical connected pixels of the same value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
