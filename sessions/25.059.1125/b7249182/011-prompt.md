Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the green (3) and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**
    *   From the green pixel's original location, create a horizontal sequence of green pixels extending to the left and right, until the middle of the distances between the blue and green pixel
    *   From the blue pixel's initial location, create a sequence of blue pixels extending horizontally to the right and to the left until the middle of the distance between the green and blue pixels.

3.  **Connect the sequences:**
    *   Create a new row in the output grid by combining the expanded green and blue sequences. The sequences starts at the left boundary and are connected at their mid point.

4.  **Vertical Replication**:
    *   Replicate the created sequence of green and blue pixels vertically, both up and down by two rows. The pixel at the horizontal position of the original green pixel will have a color of green. The pixel at the horizontal position of the original blue pixel will have the color of blue.

5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
