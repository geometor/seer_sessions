            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a horizontal fill based on the positions of a single green and a single blue pixel. The subsequent tests reveal that this approach doesn't generalize perfectly to all cases. Specifically, the code successfully handles cases where a single green and single blue pixel are present. If one or the other is not present, the code will exit, this is fine and does not need to be \"fixed\". However, the vertical replication of the filled row appears to be overly simplistic and not in line with the intended logic.\n\nThe core issue seems to be making an assumption from one example about replicating a row in all cases. The row replication should be considered.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, along with observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Green pixel at (2, 2), Blue pixel at (2, 6).\n    *   Output: Correctly filled horizontal line, replicated vertically.\n    * Observation: code logic is fine for this example.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Green pixel at (4, 3), Blue pixel at (4, 5).\n    *   Output: Correctly filled horizontal line, replicated vertically.\n     * Observation: code logic is fine for this example.\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Green pixel at (6, 5), Blue pixel at (6, 14).\n    *   Output: Correctly filled horizontal line, replicated vertically.\n     * Observation: code logic is fine for this example.\n\n*   **Example 4:** (Correct)\n    * Input has one green (4,1) and one blue (4,7).\n    * Output has a green and blue fill replicated.\n     * Observation: code logic is fine for this example.\n\n*   **Example 5** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Green pixel at (2,0) and Blue pixel at (2,8)\n    *   Output: Correct horizontal fill replicated to other rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object_types:\n    - pixel: Individual grid cell with a color value.\n    - grid: 2D array of pixels.\n  - object_properties:\n    - color: Value representing the pixel's color (0-9).\n    - coordinates: (row, column) position of a pixel within the grid.\n  - actions:\n    - find_pixel: Locate a pixel of a specific color within a grid.\n    - horizontal_fill: Fill a row segment with a color, bounded by specific coordinates or grid edges.\n    - vertical_fill: Filling all rows based on one generated row.\n  - constraints:\n      - fill_colors: Green (3) and Blue (1) are used for filling.\n      - grid_size: Output grid has same dimension as the input.\n  - logic:\n      - anchor_pixels: Green and blue pixels act as starting/ending points for the fill.\n      - fill_direction: Horizontal, from green to left edge and from blue to right edge.\n      - fill_midpoint: Space between anchors is split at the mid point.\n      - fill_replication: Single row is generated, all rows use this pattern.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Anchor Pixels:** Find the single green (3) pixel and the single blue (1) pixel within the input grid. If either is not present return a grid the same size as the input, filled with 0.\n2.  **Horizontal Fill:** Create a horizontal fill pattern in a single row based on the locations of green and blue, using their row.\n    *   Fill the row with green (3) from the green pixel's column position to the left edge of the grid.\n    *   Fill the row with blue (1) from the blue pixel's column position to the right edge of the grid.\n    *   Fill the space between the green and blue, use green to the left of the mid point and blue to the right.\n3.  **Vertical Replication:** Replicate this pattern into all rows of the output.\n4. **Preserve Grid Dimensions:** The output grid should maintain the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.\n"
