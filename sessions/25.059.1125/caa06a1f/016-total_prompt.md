Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are composed of single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. The grids appear to have a checkerboard-like pattern, and there seems to be a consistent transformation applied to the input to obtain the output. The main difference is in the color arrangement and the last row, as the last row of all 6's in the first grid is completely gone and instead of 6's, there are alternating 4's and 5's.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x6
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      patterns: checkerboard-like alternation of two colors (gray/yellow, except the last row of magenta)

  - type: color
    properties:
     mapping: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Invert the grid, swapping the values of alternating colors and remove the last row by shifting up.

relationships:
  - input grid transforms to output grid
  - colors alternate in a checkerboard pattern, with the last row different.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Observe the input grid. It contains alternating colors (yellow and gray) that creates a checkerboard.
2.  **Invert Colors**: Transform the input grid by swapping gray and yellow pixels with one another.
3. **Remove Last Row**: Remove the last row of the transformed input grid. The output should only contain 5 rows, not 6.

In summary, the transformation rule is to switch the two primary colors of the checkerboard pattern and remove the last row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
