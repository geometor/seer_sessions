Both grids are composed of single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. The grids appear to have a checkerboard-like pattern, and there seems to be a consistent transformation applied to the input to obtain the output. The main difference is in the color arrangement and the last row, as the last row of all 6's in the first grid is completely gone and instead of 6's, there are alternating 4's and 5's.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
