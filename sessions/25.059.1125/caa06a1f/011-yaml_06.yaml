facts:
  - observation: "All input examples have a last row and a last column filled entirely with blue (color code 1)."
  - object: "Input grid"
    properties:
      - "2D array of integers representing colors."
      - "Rectangular shape."
  - object: "Output grid"
    properties:
      - "2D array of integers representing colors."
      - "Rectangular shape, smaller than the input grid by one row and one column."
  - action: "Remove the last row of the input grid."
  - action: "Remove the last column of the input grid."
  - context: "The transformation consistently reduces the dimensions of the input grid by 1 in both height and width."
  - invariant: "The last row and the last column of *input* contains only color 1 (blue)."
