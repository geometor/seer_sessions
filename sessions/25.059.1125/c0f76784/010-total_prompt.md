Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pair to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 12x12 grids. The input grid contains pixels of colors gray (5) and white (0). The output grid introduces new colors: orange (7), azure (8), and magenta (6), while retaining some of the original gray and white pixels. The shapes formed by the gray pixels in the input seem to be "filled" or "outlined" with the new colors in the output. It appears that contiguous regions of gray pixels are being replaced, possibly based on their shape or relative position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 12x12
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  - type: pixel_group
    color: 5  # Gray
    description: Contiguous regions of gray pixels

actions:
  - type: fill
    target: pixel_group
    condition: shape/position
    replacement_color: [6, 7, 8] # Based on the specific group

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels within a group are adjacent (horizontally or vertically)
  - containment: New colored regions are contained within the original gray regions' outlines.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions (blobs) of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically as part of the same region.
2.  **Determine Fill Color:** For each identified gray region, determine a new fill color based on this logic:
    *   The top-left gray region changes some of its gray pixels to orange (7).
    *   The center-right gray region changes some of its gray pixels to azure (8).
    *   The bottom-left gray region changes one of its gray pixels to magenta (6)
3.  **Replace Pixels:** Replace the appropriate gray (5) pixels within each identified region with its corresponding new color. The selection process of which exact pixels should change appears to follow an internal fill and the outer layer of the original shape remains.
4.  **Retain Unchanged Pixels:** All white (0) pixels and gray pixels that were not subject to the fill operations remain unchanged in the output grid.

Essentially, the transformation identifies connected components of gray, and each group undergoes an internal color fill based on its original relative position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
