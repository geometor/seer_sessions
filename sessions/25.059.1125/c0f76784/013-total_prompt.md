"""
The transformation rule identifies contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid and replaces some of the pixels within each region with a new color based on the region's relative position, determined by its centroid. The top-left gray region is filled with orange (7), the center-right region with azure (8), and the bottom-left region has a pixel changed to magenta(6). White (0) pixels and unchanged gray pixels remain the same. The part of the region that is changed to the new color is the set of pixels that is closest to the center of the entire grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
