"""
1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Find all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Identify Inner Pixels:**  For each gray region, find the "inner" pixels. An inner pixel is a gray pixel where all four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also gray.
3.  **Horizontal Line Detection and Replacement:** Within each gray region, if there's a horizontal line of *at least* three inner gray pixels, replace the *middle* pixel(s) of that line with azure (8). If the line has an odd number of pixels, replace the single middle pixel. If the line has an even number, replace the two center-most pixels.
4.  **Magenta Replacement Below Azure:** Immediately below *any* azure pixel created in step 3, if there is an inner gray pixel and it's surrounded on its top, left, and right sides by gray, replace it with magenta (6).
5.  **2x2 Square Detection and Replacement:** Within each gray region, if there's a 2x2 square of inner gray pixels, replace all four pixels in that square with orange (7).
6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:**  All other pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs reasonably well on the first example, but shows errors in subsequent examples. The core logic of identifying gray regions, finding inner pixels, and applying transformations based on specific patterns (horizontal lines, 2x2 squares) is a good starting point. However, the rules need refinement and clarification to handle variations in the patterns and additional conditions observed in the other examples. The magenta replacement logic is too specific (dependent of azure) and needs to be broadened, possibly with its own independent rule. The logic for azure (8) placement is currently tied to ONLY horizontal lines, which might not be exhaustive. The 2x2 square logic seems correct.

The primary strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine each failed example to understand *why* the current rules are insufficient. We need to identify missed patterns, incorrect applications of rules, and any extraneous transformations.
2.  **Refine Rules:** Modify the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to accommodate the observed discrepancies. This may involve adding new conditions, generalizing existing ones, or introducing entirely new rules.
3.  **Prioritize Inner Pixels:** The concept of "inner pixels" seems crucial.  Make sure all transformations within the gray regions *only* apply to inner pixels, as the initial problem description implied.
4.  **Independent Rules**: Treat azure, magenta, and orange transformations in a way that minimizes dependency between rules, as that dependency created errors.

**Metrics and Reports**

I'll use `code_execution` to compute difference grids, highlighting discrepancies between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. This will help pinpoint exactly where the transformations are going wrong.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Locate all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels within the grid. These are our regions of interest.

2.  **Identify Inner Pixels:** Within each gray region, determine the "inner" pixels. An inner pixel is defined as a gray pixel that has gray pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right. All subsequent operations within a gray region *only* apply to these inner pixels.

3. **Azure Replacement:**
    Within each gray region, find any horizontal straight lines of 3 or more 'inner' gray pixels.
      - If the line has an odd number of pixels, change the color of the very center pixel of that line to azure (8).
      - If the line has an even number of pixels, change the color of the center *two* pixels of that line to azure (8).

4.  **Magenta Replacement:** Within each gray region, for each inner gray pixel, check if *all* the following conditions apply:
      - there is an azure pixel directly above it
      - the gray pixel is adjacent on its left, right, *and* above to *another gray pixel*.
    If all conditions are true, change the inner gray pixel's color to magenta (6).

5.  **Orange Replacement:** Within each gray region, find any 2x2 squares consisting *entirely* of inner gray pixels. If found, change the color of *all four* pixels in that 2x2 square to orange (7).

6.  **Preservation:** Any pixel not explicitly modified by the above steps retains its original color.

Key Changes and Clarifications:

*   **Inner Pixel Priority:** Explicitly stated that transformations within gray regions only affect inner pixels.
*   **Independent Rules:** The magenta replacement is made less dependent on the azure replacement, checking neighbors for gray color, rather than specifically an azure pixel created during azure replacement.
*   **Precise Wording:** More detailed description on center pixel replacement for azure.
*   **Preservation Rule:** Added a rule making it explicit all other colors are preserved.

The errors show that the magenta rule is not correct and that the horizontal line rule, while mostly correct, misses some edge cases. Specifically, example 2 includes an inner gray pixel below an azure pixel that *should* be magenta but isn't, and examples 1 & 2 have 2 azure pixels where an even number of inner gray pixels are in a horizontal row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
