The input grid contains two distinct shapes made of grey (5) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to modify the interior of these shapes with new colors while retaining the outline and the overall shape, as well as all white pixels. The top grey shape is filled with azure (8), the bottom one with orange (7).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
