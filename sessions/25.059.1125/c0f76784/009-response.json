The input grid contains pixels of colors gray (5) and white (0). The output grid introduces new colors: orange (7), azure (8), and magenta (6), while retaining some of the original gray and white pixels. The shapes formed by the gray pixels in the input seem to be \"filled\" or \"outlined\" with the new colors in the output. It appears that contiguous regions of gray pixels are being replaced, possibly based on their shape or relative position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider pixels connected horizontally or vertically as part of the same region.\n2.  **Determine Fill Color:** For each identified gray region, determine a new fill color based on this logic:\n    *   The top-left gray region changes some of its gray pixels to orange (7).\n    *   The center-right gray region changes some of its gray pixels to azure (8).\n    *   The bottom-left gray region changes one of its gray pixels to magenta (6)\n3.  **Replace Pixels:** Replace the appropriate gray (5) pixels within each identified region with its corresponding new color. The selection process of which exact pixels should change appears to follow an internal fill and the outer layer of the original shape remains.\n4.  **Retain Unchanged Pixels:** All white (0) pixels and gray pixels that were not subject to the fill operations remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation identifies connected components of gray, and each group undergoes an internal color fill based on its original relative position.\n"
