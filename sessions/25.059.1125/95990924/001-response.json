The primary object appears to be a 2x2 square of gray (color 5) pixels. The transformation adds colored pixels (blue, red, green, yellow - colors 1, 2, 3, and 4) around these gray squares. The positions of the added colors seem consistent relative to the gray squares.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
