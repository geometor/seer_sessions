Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid with colored pixels. The input grid contains several distinct "objects," which appear to be clusters of non-white pixels. The transformation seems to involve:

1.  **Color Substitution:** There's a one-to-one mapping of colors between the input and output grids. It's not a simple shift or cycle; it needs to be determined explicitly.
2.  **Shape Preservation:** The shapes of the objects remain largely the same. Contiguous colored blocks of pixels in the input are transformed into contiguous blocks of pixels in the output, preserving relative positioning and overall shape.
3. **Background unchanged:** the white pixels (value 0) in the input stay white (value 0) in the output

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: object_1
    type: cluster
    color_input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7] #blue, red, green, yellow, orange
    color_output: [1,2,3,4,7]
    shape: irregular #Need a better descriptor if shapes become relevant.
    position: varies # Will specify if positions become consistently relevant.
    size_input: 14 #pixels
    size_output: 14

  - id: object_2
    type: cluster
    color_input: [8, 2, 3]
    color_output: [8,2,3]
    shape: irregular
    position: varies
    size_input: 6
    size_output: 6
relations:
  - type: color_mapping
    subject: object_1 # all objects use the same color map
    mapping:
      1: 1 # blue to blue
      2: 2 # red to red
      3: 3 # green to green
      4: 4 # yellow to yellow
      7: 7 # orange to orange
      8: 8 # azure to azure

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct clusters of contiguous, non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider each of these clusters as a separate object.
2.  **Map Colors:** For each object, determine the color of each of its pixels. Substitute each input color with its corresponding output color, using the following rule:
    *   Blue (1) remains Blue (1).
    *   Red (2) remains Red (2).
    *   Green (3) remains Green (3).
    *   Yellow (4) remains Yellow (4)
    *   Orange (7) remains Orange(7)
    *  Azure(8) remains Azure(8)

3.  **Reconstruct Grid:** Create the output grid by placing the transformed pixel clusters in their original positions, preserving their shapes. All white (0) background pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
