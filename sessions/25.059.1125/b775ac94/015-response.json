There are distinct colored regions, which we can consider \"objects.\"\n*   **Output:** A modified version of the input grid. The modifications seem to involve:\n    *   Expansion of some colored regions.\n    *   Addition of new colored regions, mirroring the shape of expanded ones.\n* **Colors:** The colors used are from the predefined `COLOR_MAP`.\n*   **Shapes:** The objects seem to have rectangular or L shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Expand the blue object into a 3x3 square, by adding one pixel above the \"1\", and two to the right, maintaining blue (color 1)\n    *   Locate the two azure pixels at the top, and copy a 2x1 block to the right edge of the grid.\n3.  **Expansion and Mirroring, part 2:**\n    * Locate the red object (color 2) at the bottom of the image and extend the horizontal yellow bar (color 4) to the right edge, adding two yellow (color 4) pixels.\n4. **Expansion and Mirroring part 3:**\n    * Locate the magenta pixel (color 6). Add an adjacent magenta pixel (color 6) to the right.\n\nThis program covers the key transformations observed in the example. The expansion rules are specific to the observed objects and their shapes. The order of expansion and mirroring is significant for solving this problem.\n"
