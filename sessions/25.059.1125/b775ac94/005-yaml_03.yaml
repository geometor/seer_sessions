  - example_4:
       input_objects:
        - object_1: {shape: rectangle, color: yellow, count: 9}
       output_objects:
         - object_1: {shape: rectangle, color: yellow, count: 9}

  general:
    - The input and output grids are always the same size.
    - The number of objects in the input and output grids are always the same.
    - object colors are consistent
