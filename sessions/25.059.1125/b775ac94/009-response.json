There are distinct colored objects within the grid. The transformation seems to involve a replication and expansion of these colored objects. The output grid contains two copies of the original shapes, one above the other, and mirrored, created in a patterned fashion. The shapes are scaled by at least 2x, maybe a reflection.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
