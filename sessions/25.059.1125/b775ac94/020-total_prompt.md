1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored regions (objects) in the input grid. These are contiguous areas of non-zero pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to all training examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incomplete Object Interactions:** The code identifies and manipulates some objects correctly (blue, azure, yellow, magenta), but it doesn't capture all the required transformations, specifically it did not do very well with train_002.
2.  **Hardcoded Logic:** The code is somewhat rigid in its expansion and mirroring rules, making assumptions that apply only to the first training example (e.g., expanding the blue object into an exact 3x3 square).

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Iterative Refinement:** We need to go through each training example, identify the discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output, and adjust both the natural language program and the code.
2.  **Generalized Rules:** Instead of hardcoding specific dimensions or positions, we should aim for more general rules based on object properties (e.g., "expand to the edge of the grid" instead of "add two pixels").
3. **Complete Rules** It is okay to explicitly document a rule for each object, but the better strategy will attempt to generalize rules, for example "all single pixels are expanded to 3x3 squares"

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the errors, let's analyze each example and the differences between the predicted output and the expected output.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 1  # Blue
    behavior: "Expand single pixels into 3x3 squares."
  - color: 8  # Azure
    behavior: "Copy any 2x1 azure objects to right edge of grid."
  - color: 4  # Yellow
    behavior: "Extend any horizontal yellow bar to the right edge of the grid."
  - color: 6 # Magenta
    behavior: "add a single magenta pixel (color 6) to the right of any existing magenta pixel."
  - color: 2 # Red
    behavior: "Expand any single red pixels into 3x3 squares"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct colored regions (objects) in the input grid. These are contiguous areas of non-zero pixels.

2.  **Expansion of single pixels:** Locate all single pixels of colors blue (1) or red (2) and expand to 3x3 squares of the same color.

3.  **Yellow Expansion:** Locate any horizontal yellow bar and extend the bar to the right edge of the grid, maintaining the original height.

4.  **Azure Mirroring:** Locate the 2x1 azure (color 8) object. Copy this object to the right edge of the grid, aligning the top edge.

5. **Magenta Expansion:** Locate any magenta pixel (color 6) and add one magenta pixel to the right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
