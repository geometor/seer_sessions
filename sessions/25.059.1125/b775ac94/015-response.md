Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9). There are distinct colored regions, which we can consider "objects."
*   **Output:** A modified version of the input grid. The modifications seem to involve:
    *   Expansion of some colored regions.
    *   Addition of new colored regions, mirroring the shape of expanded ones.
* **Colors:** The colors used are from the predefined `COLOR_MAP`.
*   **Shapes:** The objects seem to have rectangular or L shapes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: colored_region
    properties:
      shape: [rectangular, L-shaped]
      color: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
      initial_position: varies
      size: varies
actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: "A colored region grows in size, maintaining a similar general shape."
    constraints:
      - "Expansion may occur in one or more directions."
      - "Expansion seems linked to original shape."

  - type: addition
    description: "New color regions are created"
    constraints:
      - shape: mirrors shape of expanded region
      - color: same as an existing region
      - position: adjacent to original regions

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Colored regions can be adjacent to each other, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally."
  - type: mirroring
    description: New regions mirror an original after expansion.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored regions (objects) in the input grid. These are contiguous areas of non-zero pixels.
2.  **Expansion and Mirroring, part 1:**
    *   Locate the blue object (color 1). Expand the blue object into a 3x3 square, by adding one pixel above the "1", and two to the right, maintaining blue (color 1)
    *   Locate the two azure pixels at the top, and copy a 2x1 block to the right edge of the grid.
3.  **Expansion and Mirroring, part 2:**
    * Locate the red object (color 2) at the bottom of the image and extend the horizontal yellow bar (color 4) to the right edge, adding two yellow (color 4) pixels.
4. **Expansion and Mirroring part 3:**
    * Locate the magenta pixel (color 6). Add an adjacent magenta pixel (color 6) to the right.

This program covers the key transformations observed in the example. The expansion rules are specific to the observed objects and their shapes. The order of expansion and mirroring is significant for solving this problem.
