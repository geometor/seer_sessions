Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by creating green and blue objects relative to a red object.

1. **Identify the Red Object:** Locate the horizontal line of red (2) pixels. Note its length and starting position.
2. **Create the Green Object:** Above the red object, create a green (3) rectangular block.
  - The green block's width is one pixel wider than the red object.
  - The green block's height is two rows.
  - The green block's left edge aligns with red objects left edge.
3. **Create the Blue Object:** Below the red object, create a blue (1) L-shaped block.
 - The top of the L aligns with the bottom of the red object.
 - It consists of three stacked blue pixels.
4. **Retain Unchanged Pixels**: All white pixels (0) that are not part of the generated objects remain as 0.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
