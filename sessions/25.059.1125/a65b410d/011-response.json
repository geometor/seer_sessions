            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the core concept of expanding a horizontal red line. However, it made some assumptions that don't hold true for all examples, particularly in the downward expansion and the specific lengths of the blue lines. The code assumes a fixed pattern of expansion that isn't universally applicable. The strategy for resolving errors involves:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating the Downward Expansion:** The current code's logic for the blue lines is too restrictive and doesn't match all the training examples. We need to generalize the rule for blue line placement and length.\n\n2.  **Adaptive Length:** The lengths of the green and blue lines seem to be derived from properties of the red line, but perhaps also properties of the overall grid.\n\n3.  **Edge Cases:** We need to explicitly confirm that the approach works correctly on examples that are at the extreme edge of the input grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**\n\nTo understand the patterns better, I need to gather some data.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_red_line(grid):\n    # Iterate through rows to find a horizontal line of red pixels\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols -

If no such line exists, the output is the same as the input (all white or 0).\n\n2.  **Copy the Red Line:** Copy the red line to the same row in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Green Lines (Above):**\n    *   Create three green horizontal lines above the red line.\n    *   The first green line is directly above the red line.\n    *   The second green line is above the first.\n    *    The third green line is above the second.\n    *   The first green line (adjacent to red) has length equal to the red line.\n    *   Each subsequent green line increases in length by 1, extending one pixel further to the left, but it is bound by the grid. If a line would extend beyond the edge, start from 0 and shorten by the necessary length.\n\n4.  **Blue Lines (Below):**\n    *   Create two blue horizontal lines below the red line.\n    *   The first blue line starts at the same column index as the red line.\n    *   The second blue line also starts at the same column index as the red line.\n    *    The first blue line has length 2 if red line length is 3, otherwise it has length of red line -1.\n    *   The second blue line has a length of 1.\n\n5. **Grid Dimensions**: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\nThis revised natural language program attempts to capture the observed regularities more accurately. The key improvements are the dynamic calculation of green and blue line lengths and starting columns, and the clearer handling of edge cases.\n"
