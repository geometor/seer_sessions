Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary element seems to be horizontal lines of a single color (red, represented by '2'). The transformation appears to involve adding layers of other colors (green '3', and blue '1') above and below the initial red line, with white (0) as a background. The sizes of these colored layers seem to depend on the length of initial red lines.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (variable)
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: line
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - orientation: horizontal
      - length: variable
      - position: row index

actions:
  - type: add_layer
    properties:
      - color: green (3)
      - position: above red line
      - height: variable, relative to red line length
  - type: add_layer
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - position: below red line
      - height: variable, relative to red line length

relationships:
  - green_layer_height: function of red_line_length
  - blue_layer_height: function of red_line_length
  - red object creates green object and blue object
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Line:** Find the horizontal line of red (2) pixels in the input grid. Note its row position and length.
2.  **Create the Green Layer:** Above the red line, create a green (3) layer. The green layers height/number of rows are determined by the number of '3' value, which seems to be +1 of '2' value and it stops if there is not enough space.
3.  **Create the Blue Layer:** Below the red line, create a blue (1) layer. The number of blue rows equals to the number of consecutive cells having '1', it also increases in accordance with '2', stopping if not enough space in grid.
4. **Fill remaining**: The remaining part of the grids are filled with '0'.

The program effectively describes a layered structure built around the initial red line, with the green and blue layers expanding relative to the red line's length.
