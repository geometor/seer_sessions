Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 10x10 grids. The primary colors involved are orange (7), grey (5), and white (0). The input grid has a diagonal line of orange (7) pixels from the top-left to the bottom-right. There's a small 2x2 block of grey and orange near the center. The output grid maintains the diagonal orange line but also adds orange pixels, creating what looks like two intersecting diagonal lines. The grey pixels disappear in the output, and replaced by the diagonal of orange.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    colors: [orange, grey, white]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        orange: 7
        grey: 5
        white: 0
      position: [row, column]

  - type: line
    properties:
      orientation: diagonal
      color: orange
      start: [row, column]
      end: [row, column]

  - type: block
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x2
      position: [row, column]
      colors: [orange, grey]

actions:
  - type: remove
    target: block

  - type: add
    target: line
    properties:
      orientation: diagonal
      color: orange
      start: [row, column]
      end: [row, column]

relationships:
    - type: contains
      subject: grid
      object: [pixels, lines, block]

    - type: intersects
      subject: line
      object: line
      properties:
        at_position: [row,column]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the existing diagonal line of orange (7) pixels running from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (9,9) of the input grid.
2.  **Remove** any other objects that are not part of the main diagonal. These would be the grey pixels and the orange that forms a partial square with them.
3.  **Add** a new diagonal line of orange (7) pixels running from the top-right corner (0,9) to the bottom-left corner (9,0).

Essentially, keep the existing top-left to bottom-right orange diagonal, remove the 2x2 grey/orange block, and add a new orange diagonal from top-right to bottom-left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
