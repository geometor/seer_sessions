Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing colors. The input grids appear to have diagonal lines of a specific color, and often contain a smaller, contiguous block of a different color, overlapping or adjacent to the diagonal. The output grids seem to retain only the diagonal line, extending it, and removing the smaller block of color. The diagonal always runs from top-left to bottom-right. There also appears to be a secondary diagonal, perpendicular to the main, composed by the color of the principal.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Primary Diagonal:** Find the diagonal line of cells running from the top-left to the bottom-right of the input grid. Note the color of this diagonal.
2.  **Identify Secondary Diagonal:** Find the color used to draw the main diagonal. Draw a diagonal from top-right to bottom-left, only on the cells that are 0 (white).
3.  **Identify the Block:** Locate any contiguous block of cells of a color different from the diagonal color and from white (0).
4.  **Remove the Block:** Set the values of all cells within the identified block to 0 (white).
5. **Construct Output.** The output is composed by the two diagonals.

Essentially, the transformation preserves and extends the diagonal line by one cell while removing any other colored contiguous blocks.
