The primary colors involved are orange (7), grey (5), and white (0). The input grid has a diagonal line of orange (7) pixels from the top-left to the bottom-right. There's a small 2x2 block of grey and orange near the center. The output grid maintains the diagonal orange line but also adds orange pixels, creating what looks like two intersecting diagonal lines. The grey pixels disappear in the output, and replaced by the diagonal of orange.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
