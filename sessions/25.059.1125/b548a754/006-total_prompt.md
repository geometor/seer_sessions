Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to expand a red and blue rectangle downwards and remove an azure pixel. The results show that this approach works for the first example, but fails to accurately transform the others. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Shape Identification:** The code assumes a specific rectangular shape defined by red and blue pixels. This is not consistent across all examples. Some shapes are more complex, involve different colors and internal structures.
2.  **Rigid Expansion:** The code always expands downwards by four rows. The examples show different expansion patterns, sometimes none at all.
3. **Azure removal** The code looks for a single azure pixel but in example 3 there are 2 azure pixels.

The strategy to address these issues should involve:

1.  **Generalized Shape Detection:** Instead of hardcoding color and shape assumptions, the code needs to dynamically identify the relevant object(s) based on more general properties (e.g., connectivity, bounding box).
2.  **Adaptive Expansion/Transformation:** The transformation rule should be based on observed patterns in the input-output pairs, rather than a fixed expansion. This might involve identifying repeating elements, symmetries, or other structural relationships.
3.  **Conditional Actions:** The code should be able to handle various conditions, for instance, a shape is not expanded in example 2.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand each case, let's analyze the input and output grids for the examples using the `code_execution` tool. I will look at sizes, and the specific colors and locations to better understand the issues.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid, grid_name):
    print(f"  {grid_name} shape: {grid.shape}")
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    print(f"  {grid_name} unique colors: {unique_colors}")
    for color in unique_colors:
        count = np.sum(grid == color)
        print(f"   - Color {color}: {count} pixels")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
