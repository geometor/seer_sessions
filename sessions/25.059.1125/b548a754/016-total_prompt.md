Okay, let's analyze this input-output example and try to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 13x12 grid. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white). There's a vertical structure of blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels in the left part of the grid. A single azure (8) pixel is present on the right, seemingly unconnected.
*   **Output:** A 13x12 grid. It retains some aspects of the input, such as the grid dimensions and the background of 0s. The blue (1) and magenta (6) areas are expanded horizontally to fill most of the area, except for the single column where the original shape appears and the right column with the isolated pixel. The isolated azure (8) pixel from the input is gone.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    property: fills the entire grid initially

  - object: vertical_structure
    colors: [blue (1), magenta (6)]
    property: located on the left side, contiguous

  - object: isolated_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    property: located on the right, disappears in output
    
  - action: horizontal_expansion
    colors_affected: [blue(1), magenta(6)]
    property: expands to fill grid columns, maintaining initial position and vertical arrangement
    constraint: stops expansion one before the last pixel

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the contiguous vertical structure of blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels on the left side of the grid. Also, note the existence of any single isolated pixels.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion**: For each row containing the identified blue/magenta structure, extend the colors horizontally to the right, stopping one column before the final column of the grid and not modifying the original columns where shape originated.

3.  **Remove Isolated Pixels:** Remove single disconnected pixels.

In short, the transformation involves horizontally expanding the colored vertical structure to fill a large portion of the grid, while removing single isolated pixels, keeping the columns where the pixel were before the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
