Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white). There's a vertical structure of blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels in the left part of the grid. A single azure (8) pixel is present on the right, seemingly unconnected.\n*   **Output:** A 13x12 grid. It retains some aspects of the input, such as the grid dimensions and the background of 0s. The blue (1) and magenta (6) areas are expanded horizontally to fill most of the area, except for the single column where the original shape appears and the right column with the isolated pixel. The isolated azure (8) pixel from the input is gone.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also, note the existence of any single isolated pixels.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion**: For each row containing the identified blue/magenta structure, extend the colors horizontally to the right, stopping one column before the final column of the grid and not modifying the original columns where shape originated.\n\n3.  **Remove Isolated Pixels:** Remove single disconnected pixels.\n\nIn short, the transformation involves horizontally expanding the colored vertical structure to fill a large portion of the grid, while removing single isolated pixels, keeping the columns where the pixel were before the transformation.\n"
