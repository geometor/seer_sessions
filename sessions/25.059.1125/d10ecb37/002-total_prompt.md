**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be a consistent 2x2 grid across all examples. The colors in the output grid appear to be derived from the top-left corner of the input grid. It seems like the transformation is selecting a specific 2x2 subgrid from the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid of varying dimensions, with cells containing digits 0-9 representing colors.
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid, consistently 2x2, with cells containing digits 0-9.
  - relation: spatial
    description: The output grid's colors correspond to the colors of the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid.
  - action: selection
    description: A 2x2 subgrid is selected from the input.
  - location: specific
    description: The selection is always the top-left corner of input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid.
2.  **Locate** the 2x2 subgrid at the top-left corner of the input grid.
3.  **Extract** the color values (digits) from this 2x2 subgrid.
4.  **Create** a new 2x2 output grid.
5.  **Populate** the output grid with the extracted color values, maintaining their relative positions. That, is the top left value of input grid becomes top left of output grid and so on for all four values of the 2x2 grid.

Essentially, the program describes a simple extraction of the top-left 2x2 portion of the input grid to form the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
