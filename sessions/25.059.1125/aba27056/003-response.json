The input grid contains a magenta (6) shape on a white (0) background. The output grid introduces a new color, yellow (4), within the magenta shape and also on the background in a new pattern. The magenta shape appears to remain unchanged. The core transformation seems to be adding the yellow color in a specific arrangement.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
