```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target Shape:** Find the single contiguous shape composed of non-white pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Trace the outermost points of the shape. The output will be a filled rectangle defined by these points, and in cases where the original shape is next to a white pixel, the boundary is extended by one pixel.

3.  **Fill with Yellow:** Create a new grid where all pixels within the calculated border, and including the border, are colored yellow.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, aiming to identify a non-white shape, trace its border (expanding it if adjacent to white pixels), and fill the resulting bounding box with yellow. The provided code has errors. The strategy to address them is:

1.  **Analyze Results on All Examples:** Carefully examine the `*_results.png` for each example, comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `transform` function.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint specific cases where the code fails to produce the correct output. Determine the nature of these failures (e.g., incorrect border expansion, incorrect filling, failure to identify the target shape correctly).
3. **Gather Metrics**: execute code to confirm any assumptions made about the
   grid and objects
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified discrepancies, revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation rule that applies to *all* training examples.
5.  **Update Code (Later):** In the subsequent "coder" phase, the code will be updated to reflect the refined natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the results, I'll use code execution to analyze each example.
I will use python to determine details about each input and expected output
grid, and about each result grid.

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def analyze_grid(grid, grid_name):
    """Analyzes a single grid and returns relevant metrics."""
    
    non_white_pixels = np.where(grid != 0)
    num_non_white_pixels = len(non_white_pixels[0])
    
    # Determine bounding box
    if num_non_white_pixels > 0:
        min_row, max_row = np.min(non_white_pixels[0]), np.max(non_white_pixels[0])
        min_col, max_col = np.min(non_white_pixels[1]), np.max(non_white_pixels[1])
        bounding_box_area = (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)
    else:
        min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = 0, 0, 0, 0
        bounding_box_area = 0

    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_counts = {color: np.sum(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}

    metrics = {
        f"{grid_name}_height": grid.shape[0],
        f"{grid_name}_width": grid.shape[1],
        f"{grid_name}_num_non_white_pixels": num_non_white_pixels,
        f"{grid_name}_bounding_box_area": bounding_box_area,
        f"{grid_name}_min_row": min_row,
        f"{grid_name}_max_row": max_row,
        f"{grid_name}_min_col": min_col,
        f"{grid_name}_max_col": max_col,
        f"{grid_name}_unique_colors": unique_colors.tolist(),
        f"{grid_name}_color_counts": color_counts,
    }
    return metrics

def analyze_example(example_num):

    input_grid = np.array(Image.open(f'input_{example_num}.png').convert('L')) / 28
    output_grid = np.array(Image.open(f'output_{example_num}.png').convert('L')) / 28
    result_grid = np.array(Image.open(f'result_{example_num}.png').convert('L')) / 28

    input_metrics = analyze_grid(input_grid, "input")
    output_metrics = analyze_grid(output_grid, "output")
    result_metrics = analyze_grid(result_grid, "result")
    
    all_metrics = {**input_metrics, **output_metrics, **result_metrics}
    return all_metrics

# Analyze all examples
all_example_metrics = {}
for i in range(3):
    all_example_metrics[i] = analyze_example(i)

# Print results for review
for example_num, metrics in all_example_metrics.items():
    print(f"Example {example_num}:")
    for key, value in metrics.items():
        print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

**Analysis of Results and Metrics**

Here's a summary of the analysis, combining visual inspection of the images and the code execution results:

*   **Example 0:**
    *   The code works correctly. The input shape (red) is replaced by a filled yellow rectangle encompassing the original shape. The bounding box expansion next to white is correct.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   The code extends to far to the right. Input has a blue shape. Expected output is yellow filled rectangle encompassing the entire shape. The expansion should consider the entire shape and include the entire shape within the border.
*   **Example 2:**
   * the code extends too far. The object is green, the output encompasses the original object.
**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 0
    input_object:
      color: red
      shape: irregular
    transformation:
      action: replace with bounding box
      fill_color: yellow
    output_object:
      color: yellow
      shape: rectangle
  - example_id: 1
    input_object:
      color: blue
      shape: irregular
    transformation:
      action: replace with bounding box
      fill_color: yellow
    output_object:
      color: yellow
      shape: rectangle
  - example_id: 2
    input_object:
      color: green
      shape: irregular
    transformation:
      action: replace with bounding box
      fill_color: yellow
    output_object:
      color: yellow
      shape: rectangle

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Shape:** Locate the single contiguous region (object) of non-white pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (the bounding box) that completely encloses the target shape. This is done by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the non-white pixels.

3.  **Fill with Yellow:** Create a new grid, the same size as the input. All pixels within the bounding box determined in step 2 are colored yellow. All other pixels should remain unchanged.

The previous version included an erroneous border expansion.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
