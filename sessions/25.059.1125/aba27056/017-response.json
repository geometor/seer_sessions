            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were reasonably close but have some inaccuracies, particularly in handling edge cases and specific pixel configurations. The code correctly identifies the core concept of propagating yellow around green pixels. However, it includes extra, incorrect rules (\"Fill Gaps\", \"Corners\"). It needs adjustment to generalize correctly across all training examples. By looking at the example output, we can see what the output *should* be. The error cases highlight that \"fill gaps\" and \"corners\" does *not* happen for all white cells, but only in specific circumstances.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Eliminate Incorrect Rules:** Remove the \"Fill Gaps\" and \"Corners\" rules as they are not universally applicable and were likely overfitted to the first example.\n2.  **Focus on Adjacency:** Re-emphasize the core rule: white pixels become yellow *only* if they are adjacent to green pixels.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use the execution results to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails and adjust the program accordingly. We are provided with more information than what was available when the first program was developed - use this additional information, especially errors, to guide the creation of the next program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**\n\nI'll use a simplified representation of the grids here, focusing on the key areas of difference. I can represent the \"correct output\" based on the images and the \"actual output\" from the python `transform` function, and identify the difference to develop an error report.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[3,0,3],[0,0,0],[3,0,3]]` (simplified)\n    *   Expected Output: `[[3,4,3],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[3,4,3],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]`\n    *   Result: **Success**. The initial example, on which the first version of the code was trained, continues to pass.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input:\n        ```\n        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n        ```\n    *   Expected Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n        ```\n    *   Actual Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n         [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n         [4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n        ```\n    *   Result: **Failure**. The \"Fill Gaps\" and \"Corners\" rules incorrectly changed \\[5,0] and \\[5,1] to 4, and \\[2,4] and \\[4,4] were not changed when they should have been.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input:\n        ```\n        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 3, 0, 3, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n        ```\n    *   Expected Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n         [0, 3, 0, 3, 0],\n         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n        ```\n        \n    *    Actual Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n         [0, 3, 0, 3, 0],\n         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n        ```\n\n    *   Result: **Success**. The changes correctly propagated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - id: green_pixels\n    color: 3  # Green\n    shape: irregular\n    behavior: static\n    role: source\n\n  - id: white_pixels\n    color: 0  # White\n    shape: irregular\n    behavior: dynamic\n    role: target\n\n  - id: yellow_pixels\n    color: 4 # Yellow\n    shape: irregular\n    behavior: result\n    role: result\n\nactions:\n  - name: propagate_yellow\n    source: green_pixels\n    target: white_pixels\n    condition: adjacency\n    result: white_pixels become yellow_pixels\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains green pixels (source) and white pixels (target).\n2.  **Propagate Yellow:** Any white pixel that is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a green pixel changes to yellow.\n3. **No Other Changes:** White pixels not adjacent to a green pixel are unchanged. Green pixels are unchanged.\n"
