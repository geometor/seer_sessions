The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Background:** The input grid consists of green and white pixels.
2.  **Propogate White:** Any white pixel adjacent to a green pixel changes to yellow.
3. **Fill Gaps:** A single white pixel in the lower left is changed to Yellow
4. **Border:** The original border from the original image is unchanged.
5. **Corners:** A white pixel between yellow pixels in the bottom row is changed to Yellow.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were reasonably close but have some inaccuracies, particularly in handling edge cases and specific pixel configurations. The code correctly identifies the core concept of propagating yellow around green pixels. However, it includes extra, incorrect rules ("Fill Gaps", "Corners"). It needs adjustment to generalize correctly across all training examples. By looking at the example output, we can see what the output *should* be. The error cases highlight that "fill gaps" and "corners" does *not* happen for all white cells, but only in specific circumstances.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Eliminate Incorrect Rules:** Remove the "Fill Gaps" and "Corners" rules as they are not universally applicable and were likely overfitted to the first example.
2.  **Focus on Adjacency:** Re-emphasize the core rule: white pixels become yellow *only* if they are adjacent to green pixels.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use the execution results to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails and adjust the program accordingly. We are provided with more information than what was available when the first program was developed - use this additional information, especially errors, to guide the creation of the next program.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

I'll use a simplified representation of the grids here, focusing on the key areas of difference. I can represent the "correct output" based on the images and the "actual output" from the python `transform` function, and identify the difference to develop an error report.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[3,0,3],[0,0,0],[3,0,3]]` (simplified)
    *   Expected Output: `[[3,4,3],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[3,4,3],[4,4,4],[3,4,3]]`
    *   Result: **Success**. The initial example, on which the first version of the code was trained, continues to pass.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input:
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]
        ```
    *   Expected Output:
        ```
        [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]
        ```
    *   Actual Output:
        ```
        [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
         [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
         [4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0]]
        ```
    *   Result: **Failure**. The "Fill Gaps" and "Corners" rules incorrectly changed \[5,0] and \[5,1] to 4, and \[2,4] and \[4,4] were not changed when they should have been.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input:
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
        ```
    *   Expected Output:
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
         [0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
        ```
        
    *    Actual Output:
        ```
        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
         [0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
         [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
        ```

    *   Result: **Success**. The changes correctly propagated.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_pixels
    color: 3  # Green
    shape: irregular
    behavior: static
    role: source

  - id: white_pixels
    color: 0  # White
    shape: irregular
    behavior: dynamic
    role: target

  - id: yellow_pixels
    color: 4 # Yellow
    shape: irregular
    behavior: result
    role: result

actions:
  - name: propagate_yellow
    source: green_pixels
    target: white_pixels
    condition: adjacency
    result: white_pixels become yellow_pixels
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains green pixels (source) and white pixels (target).
2.  **Propagate Yellow:** Any white pixel that is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a green pixel changes to yellow.
3. **No Other Changes:** White pixels not adjacent to a green pixel are unchanged. Green pixels are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
