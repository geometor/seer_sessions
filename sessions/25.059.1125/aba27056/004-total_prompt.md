Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a magenta (6) shape on a white (0) background. The output grid introduces a new color, yellow (4), within the magenta shape and also on the background in a new pattern. The magenta shape appears to remain unchanged. The core transformation seems to be adding the yellow color in a specific arrangement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      background_color: 0 (white)
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 6 (magenta)
      location: bottom-center
      shape_type: irregular, resembling a filled 'U' or horseshoe
  - type: new_shape # inferring it's a separate shape since it follows a distinct rule
    properties:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      location: inside and surrounding parts of magenta shape

actions:
  - type: add_color
    properties:
      color_added: 4 (yellow)
      rules: "See natural language program below"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the magenta shape:** Locate the contiguous block of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Overlay Yellow Inside:** Find the pixels that are directly above magenta and make yellow.
3.  **Overlay Border:**
    *   Locate all white (0) pixels adjacent to any magenta (6) pixel.
    *   For any horizontal edges of magenta pixels, extend the border one step further in the perpendicular direction. This creates a kind of cross-stitch pattern

Essentially, it's adding the new color following a "cross-stitch" type rule around the magenta.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
