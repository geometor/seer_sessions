The input grid primarily consists of green (3) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels, modifies some white (0) pixels, and leaves some green pixels unchanged. The shape and size of the grid remain constant. The introduction of yellow seems to be related to the spatial arrangement of the original white and green pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
