Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid primarily consists of green (3) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels, modifies some white (0) pixels, and leaves some green pixels unchanged. The shape and size of the grid remain constant. The introduction of yellow seems to be related to the spatial arrangement of the original white and green pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6 (rows x columns)
      - cell_values: integers representing colors (0-9)
  - type: colors
    description: Colors are represented by integers.
    mapping:
      0: white
      3: green
      4: yellow
  - type: transformation
    description:  Pixels change colors based on a rule.
    rules:
      - original_color: white (0)
        new_color: yellow (4)
        condition:  White pixels surrounded by at least one green and one white change to Yellow
      - original_color: green (3)
        new_color: green(3)
        condition: some green remains unchanged
  - type: objects
    description: solid color regions
    properties:
      - color
      - shape
      - adjacency

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background:** The input grid consists of green and white pixels.
2.  **Propogate White:** Any white pixel adjacent to a green pixel changes to yellow.
3. **Fill Gaps:** A single white pixel in the lower left is changed to Yellow
4. **Border:** The original border from the original image is unchanged.
5. **Corners:** A white pixel between yellow pixels in the bottom row is changed to Yellow.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
