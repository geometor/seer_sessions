Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the magenta shape:** Locate the contiguous block of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Overlay Yellow Inside:** Find the pixels that are directly above magenta and make yellow.
3.  **Overlay Border:**
    *   Locate all white (0) pixels adjacent to any magenta (6) pixel.
    *   For any horizontal edges of magenta pixels, extend the border one step further in the perpendicular direction. This creates a kind of cross-stitch pattern

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observing the first training example. While it correctly identified the core concept of manipulating pixels around the magenta shape, it's clear from the errors in subsequent examples that the initial rules for "overlaying yellow inside" and "overlaying the border" are incomplete or incorrect. The "cross-stitch" border rule, in particular, seems to be too specific to the first example and doesn't generalize well.

My strategy to resolve these errors is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to where the current code succeeds and fails.
2.  **Identify Core Operations:** Determine the fundamental operations being performed on the magenta shape, rather than focusing on highly specific patterns like "cross-stitch." Look at connections and adjacency.
3.  **Refine Rules:** Rewrite the natural language program with more general and accurate rules, focusing on the relative positions of yellow and white pixels to the magenta shape.
4. **Focus on Inside vs. Outside:** The concept needs a better representation of the difference between pixels above and surrounding.
5. **Review Test:** Keep the test example in mind.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a clearer picture of the errors, let's create a report on the results:

```python

    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    for r, c in magenta_coords:
        if r > 0 and grid[r-1,c] == 0:
          new_grid[r-1, c] = 4  # Set pixel above to yellow
    return new_grid

def overlay_border(grid, magenta_coords):
    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r, c in magenta_coords:
        # Check adjacent pixels
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: magenta_shape
    color: 6
    description: The core shape that serves as the basis for the transformation. It can be any contiguous arrangement of magenta pixels.
  - name: yellow_pixels
    color: 4
    description: Pixels added based on the position of the magenta shape. May appear above or surrounding magenta.
  - name: input_grid
    description: the initial grid
  - name: output_grid
    description: the transformed grid

actions:
  - name: identify_magenta
    description: Locate all magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
  - name: add_yellow_above
    description: Place yellow (4) pixels directly above the magenta shape.
  - name: add_yellow_border
    description: Place yellow (4) pixels in a border around the magenta shape, specifically where white pixels touch magenta.
```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Magenta Shape:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are magenta (color 6).  These pixels form the "magenta shape."

2.  **Yellow Above:** For every magenta pixel in the magenta shape, if the pixel directly *above* it is white (color 0), change that white pixel to yellow (color 4).

3.  **Yellow Border:** Examine every pixel *adjacent* (up, down, left, or right, but *not diagonal*) to the magenta shape. If an adjacent pixel is white (color 0), change it to yellow (color 4).

The critical change is distinguishing between pixels *above* the magenta shape (which get filled based on a direct vertical relationship) and pixels *bordering* the magenta shape (which are filled based on adjacency). The "cross-stitch" concept is removed, as it doesn't generalize. The core logic is now based on adjacency and relative vertical position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
