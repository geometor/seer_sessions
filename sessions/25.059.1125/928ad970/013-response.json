The gray pixels seem to act as \"anchors\" or \"markers\". The green pixels form a connected shape.\n*   **Output:** The same grid, but with an expanded green area. The green area in the output extends outwards from its original position in the input, forming a larger, connected region, like a filled outline. The gray pixels remain in the same positions. White pixels are mostly unchanged, filling any area not part of another object.\n* The input green object becomes a hollow object in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
