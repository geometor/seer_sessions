There are distinct regions or \"objects\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The input seems to have a blue square-like object at the center, surrounded by white, with a few isolated gray pixels. The output expands this blue object outwards, creating a larger blue frame-like structure, while maintaining the positions of the gray pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
