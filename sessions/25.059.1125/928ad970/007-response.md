Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, aiming to discern the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (represented by numbers 0-9). There are distinct regions or "objects" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The input seems to have a blue square-like object at the center, surrounded by white, with a few isolated gray pixels. The output expands this blue object outwards, creating a larger blue frame-like structure, while maintaining the positions of the gray pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: central_shape
    type: rectangle
    initial_color: blue (1)
    final_color: blue (1)
    initial_position: center
    final_position: center
    action: expand
    description: The central blue shape expands outwards in all directions.
  - object: isolated_pixels
    type: single_pixels
    initial_color: gray (5)
    final_color: gray (5)
    initial_position: scattered
    final_position: unchanged
    action: none
    description: Isolated gray pixels maintain their positions.
  - object: background
    type: grid
    initial_color: white (0)
    final_color: partially white(0) / partially blue(1)
    initial_position: all
    final_position: all
    action: overwrite
    description: Background white is overwritten by the expansion of the central shape.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the central blue (1) rectangular shape.
2.  **Expand** the blue shape outwards in all directions (up, down, left, and right) by one pixel.
3. **Repeat** expansion by one more pixel layer. The end expansion are two layers.
4.  **Preserve** the positions and colors of the isolated gray (5) pixels.
5.  **Overwrite** any white (0) pixels encountered during the expansion with the blue (1) color.
