facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary transformation involves blue objects.  Other colored objects
      are present and should be preserved.
  - object: blue_region
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      behavior: expands outwards
    constraints:
      expansion_limit: white (0) pixels only
  - object: other_colored_region
    properties:
      color: any color other than blue (not 1)
      behavior: static (remains unchanged)
  - action: expansion
    description: |
      Blue regions expand by one pixel in all cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
    precondition: adjacent cell is white (0)
    postcondition: adjacent cell becomes blue (1) if it was white (0)
  - rule: |
      Colors in the output grid are determined as follows: if the input grid cell is blue,
      then the cell and any directly adjacent white cells become blue; all other cells
      retain their original colors.
