1.  **Identify** the gray (5) pixels in the input grid. These remain unchanged in the output.
2.  **Identify** the connected green (3) pixels in the input.
3.  **Hollow** out the original green pixels - expand green pixels in all directions by one cell.
4.  **Fill**: Any cell, not part of any other object (gray or hollowed green object), becomes, or remains, white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
