An isolated pixel is one that has no adjacent pixels (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) of the same color. Also locate contiguous regions of yellow (4).\n\n2.  **Preserve Isolated Pixels:** The positions and colors of the isolated pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Expand Contiguous Yellow Region (if present):** If a contiguous region (more than one pixel) of yellow exists, expand it outward in all eight directions (including diagonals) one layer at time.\n\n    *   The expansion stops when it encounters either an isolated pixel of *any* color, or an edge of the grid.\n    *   The yellow pixels expand one layer at a time.\n\n4.  **Output:** The resulting grid, with preserved isolated pixels and the potentially expanded yellow region, is the transformation.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_isolated_pixels(grid, colors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find isolated pixels of specified colors in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    isolated = []\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] in colors:\n                is_isolated = True\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]:\n                            if grid[nr, nc] == grid[r, c]:\n                                is_isolated = False\n                                break\n                    if not is_isolated:\n                        break\n                if is_isolated:\n                    isolated.append((r, c))\n    return isolated\n\ndef find_yellow_regions(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find contiguous regions of yellow (4).\n    \"\"\"\n    regions = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_region):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not (0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]) or grid[r, c] != 4:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_region.append((r, c))\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(r + dr, c + dc, current_region)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == 4 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_region = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_region)\n                if len(current_region) > 1:  # Only consider regions with more than one pixel\n                    regions.append(current_region)\n    return regions\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # find isolated pixels (gray, yellow, green)\n    isolated_pixels = find_isolated_pixels(input_grid, [5, 4, 3])\n\n    # find yellow regions\n    yellow_regions = find_yellow_regions(input_grid)\n\n    # expand yellow region\n    if yellow_regions:\n        for region in yellow_regions:\n            expanded_region = set(region)\n            while True:\n                new_expanded_region = set(expanded_region)\n                for r, c in expanded_region:\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                            if (0 <= nr < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < input_grid.shape[1] and\n                                    input_grid[nr, nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in isolated_pixels):\n                                #expand to white and not to isolated pixels\n                                new_expanded_region.add((nr, nc))\n                if new_expanded_region == expanded_region:\n                  break\n                else:\n                  expanded_region = new_expanded_region\n\n            for r,c in expanded_region:\n              output_grid[r,c] = 4\n\n    # preserve isolated pixels\n    for r, c in isolated_pixels:\n        output_grid[r, c] = input_grid[r, c]  # Use original color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
