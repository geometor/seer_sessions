The input grids contain a prominent, usually centrally located, colored shape surrounded by a background of '0' (white).  The output grid seems to be a zoomed-in and inverted representation of this central shape. The inversion involves swapping the colors of the inner and surrounding pixels within the shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This region represents the shape of interest.\n2.  **Determine Inner and Outer Colors:** Within the identified shape, distinguish between the 'inner' color and the 'outer' color. The outer color forms the boundary of the shape, while the inner color fills the center.\n3. **Extract relevant area**: Find the bounding box of the non-zero area, then enlarge it by one pixel on all sides (or as much as possible given boundary conditions.)\n4.  **Invert Colors:** Swap the inner and outer color values to perform the inversion.\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct the output grid with dimensions encompassing the inverted colors representing core of the input shape and one layer of surronding pixels.\n\nIn essence, the program finds a shape, identifies its inner and outer colors, inverts those colors, and creates a new, smaller grid representing the core and border of that inverted shape.\n"
