"""
1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Locate the largest rectangular block of contiguous pixels of the same color (excluding '0' - white) within the input grid.
2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center pixel of this rectangular block. Note its color.
3.  **Determine background fill color**: get color value from the center pixel of target object
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 5x5 output grid.
5.  **Fill the center:** fill all pixels with background fill color
6.  **Extract and Place Center Pixel:** Fill the single, central pixel of 5x5 output with the original color from object in step 1.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
