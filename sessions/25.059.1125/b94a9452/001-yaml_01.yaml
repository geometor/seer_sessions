facts:
  - type: input
    description: A 2D grid of integers (colors).
    properties:
      - background_color: 0 (white)
      - shape: Usually centrally located, rectangular, composed of two colors.
      - inner_color:  A distinct color within the shape.
      - outer_color: A distinct color forming the border/surrounding of the inner color.

  - type: output
    description: A smaller 2D grid of integers, derived from the input.
    properties:
      - dimensions: Smaller than the input grid.
      - inverted_colors: Represents an inverted color mapping of the input shape.
      - relation_to_input:  Represents the "core" and one surrounding layer of pixels of a salient object

  - type: transformation
    description: Identification and inversion of a central shape.
    actions:
      - identify_shape: Locate the contiguous colored region in the input.
      - determine_inner_outer: Identify inner and outer colors of the shape.
      - invert_colors: Swap the inner and outer colors.
      - extract_subgrid: Create a smaller grid representing the inverted shape.
