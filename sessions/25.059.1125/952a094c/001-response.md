Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves identifying and extracting specific elements within a grid. The core concept appears to be identifying a closed shape, defined by a continuous border of a single color, and extracting the colors *inside* that shape and the color of the bounding shape. The output grid seems to mirror the input grid's dimensions, but only includes the "inner" colors of the enclosed shape, and the bordering color in specific positions. The position and order of inner colors in the output looks important.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: enclosed_shape
    properties:
      - type: geometric shape
      - definition:  area enclosed by a continuous border of a single color
      - border_color: varies (e.g., azure, orange, blue)
      - inner_colors:  list of colors found within the enclosed shape
    actions:
      - identify: locate the enclosed shape within the grid
      - extract_inner_colors:  determine the colors of the pixels inside the shape
      - extract border color

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input grid
      - content:
        - corners: replaced with colors of the input shape inner colors
    actions:
       - transfer: map extracted inner colors to the corner positions of the output grid, maintaining the relative positions
       - mirror boarder color: transfer border color pixels to output grid, mirroring the input grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Enclosed Shape:** Find the contiguous block of pixels forming a closed shape, defined by its uniform border color.

2.  **Extract Inner Colors:** Identify all unique colors *inside* this enclosed shape.

3.  **Extract Border Color:** Identify the color of the border.

4.  **Mirror Border:** Transfer the border color to the output, in the same position as in the input

5.  **Populate Output Grid:**
    *   Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
    *   Place the inner colors in a specific order in the output: Top-left corner, bottom-left corner, bottom-right corner, top-right corner. Order of placement should match order within the input grid, going clockwise (or anti-clockwise, needs to be confirmed with more examples).
    *   All other cells in the output grid, except for the enclosed shape's border, remain '0' (white).

The critical part I'm not 100% sure of is the consistent mapping of *which* inner color goes to *which* output corner. The provided examples suggest a spatial relationship, but more data would be needed to nail this detail down. It seems like a clockwise, or perhaps spiral inward from topleft mapping.
