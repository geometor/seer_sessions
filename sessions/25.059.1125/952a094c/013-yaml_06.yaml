  - description: "Four pixels change their colors in each example."
    details: "The colors of these pixels are always a permutation of the original colors. No new colors appear, and no colors disappear."
  - example_0:
      changed_pixels: [[1, 1], [1, 7], [7, 1], [7, 7]]
      input_colors: [blue, red, green, yellow]
      output_colors: [red, yellow, blue, green]
      permutation: [2, 4, 1, 3]
  - example_1:
      changed_pixels: [[4, 5], [4, 13], [8, 5], [8, 13]]
      input_colors: [gray, magenta, orange, azure]
      output_colors: [magenta, azure, gray, orange]
      permutation: [6,8,5,7]
  - example_2:
      changed_pixels: [[8, 8], [8, 15], [15, 8], [15, 15]]
      input_colors: [blue, red, green, yellow]
      output_colors: [red, yellow, blue, green]
      permutation: [2,4,1,3]
  - observation: "The four changed pixels appear to form a rectangle or square, using two distinct rows and two distinct columns. The input colors of the changed pixels are unique in examples 0 and 2, while example 1 uses a unique set of colors, but the same row index is used for non-diagonal positions."
  - observation_2: "The color swaps follow a consistent pattern: The colors are cyclically rotated clockwise. Top-left to top-right, top-right to bottom-right, bottom-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-left."
