Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 10x10 grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are orange (7), red (2), blue (8), green (3), and maroon (9), with a background of white (0). The input grid appears to have a hollow, rectangular, orange "frame." Inside this frame are other colored pixels. The output grid seems to maintain the orange frame but rotates the colors within it to a new position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: frame
    type: rectangle
    color: orange (7)
    property: hollow
    location: perimeter_of_inner_area
  - id: inner_pixels
    type: pixels
    colors: [red (2), blue (8), green (3), maroon (9)]
    location: inside_frame
actions:
  - type: rotation
    object: inner_pixels
    direction: clockwise? # Need to confirm direction, appears to be swapping positions
    amount: 1 # moving colors inside
relationships:
  - type: contains
    subject: frame
    object: inner_pixels
  - type: positional_change
    subject: inner_pixels
    preposition: 'output vs input'
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Frame:** Locate the rectangular, hollow frame composed of orange (7) pixels. This frame occupies rows 3-8 and columns 3-8.

2.  **Isolate Inner Pixels:** Identify all non-white and non-orange pixels located within the boundaries of the orange frame. Specifically, these are in positions `[3,3], [3, 6], [6, 3], [6, 6]` in the input.

3.  **Extract inner colors:** Extract the color values that are not part of the frame (not 0 or 7) and create an array of these color values.

4. **Swap inner positions**: replace colors from the inner frame with the values from this array in reverse. The mapping is as follows:
    *   `[3,3]` -> `[1,8]`
    *   `[3,6]` -> `[1,1]`
    *   `[6,3]` -> `[8,8]`
    *   `[6,6]` -> `[8,1]`

5.  **Generate Output:** Create a new grid with the orange frame identical to the input. Fill in the identified inner positions by swapping colors. Leave all other pixels white (0).

Essentially the program performs a positional swap, placing the extracted color in a predefined location.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
