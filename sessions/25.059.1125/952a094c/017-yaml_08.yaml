facts:
  - task: "Mirroring within a blue border"
  - input: "2D grid of colored pixels (0-9)"
  - output: "2D grid of colored pixels (0-9)"
  - objects:
    - border:
        type: rectangle
        color: blue (1)
        behavior: "Defines the mirroring region"
    - inner_object:
      type: pixel
      color: "any color except white (0) or blue (1)"
      behavior: "Mirrored across the border's center"
  - actions:
    - mirroring:
      description: "Reflects the position of inner objects across both horizontal and vertical center lines of the blue border."
      constraints: "Mirroring occurs *within* the detected blue border."
  - observations:
      - example_1: "Correct mirroring."
      - example_2: "One object mirrored incorrectly."
      - example_3: "Multiple objects mirrored incorrectly, seems to be a horizontal AND vertical reflection"
