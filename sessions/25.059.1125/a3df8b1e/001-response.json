The dominant color is white (0).  A single blue (1) pixel appears in the bottom row of the input grids. The output grids seem to be a transformation of the input, involving a pattern of alternating white and blue pixels, and the position of the blue pixel appears to shift in a predictable way based on the initial blue pixel location in the input grid. The height of input and output seems to be constant. The output grid width seems to be determined based on input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note its height and width, and the column index of the single blue (1) pixel in the bottom row.\n\n2. **Output Grid Creation:** Create an output grid with the same height and width as the input grid.\n\n3. **Pattern Generation:** Iterate through each cell of the output grid, row by row, and column by column.\n\n4. **Color Assignment:**\n    *   Start filling columns with the blue pixel, shifting its location up by one row in each subsequent column, until it is in the first row, at which point the location resets back to the bottom row and repeats this behaviour.\n    * The row that contains the blue pixel shifts by one column to the right from its position in the previous column.\n\n5.  Fill all remaining cell with white pixels.\n"
