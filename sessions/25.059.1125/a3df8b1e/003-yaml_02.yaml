facts:
  - observation: Input grid is a 2x10 matrix.
  - observation: Output grid is a 2x10 matrix.
  - observation: Input grid contains mostly 0 (white) values.
  - observation: Input grid contains a single 1 (blue) value at position (9,0).
  - observation: Output grid has alternating 0 (white) and 1 (blue) values in each column.
  - observation: Output grid's first column starts with 0 and alternates to 1.
  - observation: "Output grid's second column starts with one and alternates with 0"
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x10
      values: Mostly 0, one 1 at (9,0)
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x10
      values: Alternating 0 and 1 in each column.
  - relationship: OutputGrid dimensions match InputGrid dimensions.
  - relationship: "InputGrid blue pixel triggers alternating pattern."
  - action: "transformInputToOutput: Generates alternating pattern in output based on the existence of value 1 in the input."
