Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying a single blue pixel in the input grid and generating a repeating pattern of blue pixels in the output grid. The pattern alternates between the first and second columns for the first three rows, then switches to column 2, and repeats this four-step sequence.

import numpy as np

def find_blue_pixel(grid):
    # Find the coordinates of the blue pixel (value 1).
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
      for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if grid[r][c] == 1:
          return (r,c)
    return None

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and all zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # find blue, could be none
    blue_pixel = find_blue_pixel(input_grid)

    # if no blue, return all white
    if blue_pixel==None:
      return output_grid

    # Create the repeating pattern.
    for row in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        if row % 4 == 0:
          output_grid[row, 1] = 1
        elif row % 4 == 1:
          output_grid[row, 0] = 1
        elif row % 4 == 2:
            output_grid[row,1] = 1
        elif row % 4 == 3:
            output_grid[row, 2] = 1


    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example, which involved a repeating pattern of blue pixels. However, the results from executing this code on the other training examples show that this initial hypothesis is incorrect or, at best, incomplete. The generated outputs do not consistently match the expected outputs, indicating that the transformation rule is more complex than initially perceived. The presence of a blue pixel in input and creating blue output is related.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the positioning of the blue pixel in the input and the arrangement of blue pixels in the corresponding output.
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** We will look for correlations between the blue pixel's location in the input and the structure of the blue pixels in the output. We'll explore different potential patterns (e.g., mirroring, shifting, conditional placement based on the input pixel location).
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, we will revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rules.
4. **Code execution**: examine parts of the code to see what may be improved

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To get accurate results, I will provide a summary for each input/output pair.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Blue pixel at (0, 1).
    *   Output: Repeating blue pattern in output.
    *   Result: Successful match.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Blue pixel at (2, 0).
    *   Output: Blue pixels on first column.
    *   Result: Fails, output has blue in multiple columns.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Blue pixel at (4,3)
    *   Output: Blue pixels at every location in column 4.
    *   Result: Fails, output has blue in multiple columns.
*   Example 4:
    *  Input: No blue pixel.
    * Output: All zeros.
    * Result: Successful match.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: (0, 1)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue
        pattern: "repeating sequence: col 1, col 0, col 1, col 2"
    transformation: "Output pattern is a fixed sequence, potentially unrelated to the input blue pixel's row, but dependent on its presence."

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: (2, 0)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: "all rows, column 0"
    transformation: "Output blue pixels are placed in the first column (column index 0)."

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: (4, 3)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: "all rows, column 4"
    transformation: "Output blue pixels are placed in a column that's +1 the column index of the blue pixel in input"

  - example_id: 4
    input_objects:
        - color: none
          location: none
    output_objects:
        -color: none
         location: none
    transformation: if no blue pixel, return an all white image
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Check for Blue Pixel:** Examine the input grid to determine if a blue pixel exists.
2.  **No Blue Pixel Case:** If no blue pixel is found, the output grid remains all zeros (white).
3.  **Blue Pixel Exists** Locate the x,y coordinates of the blue pixel.
4. **Output column**: The output will contain blue in a single column.
5. **Determine column:** The column is determined as x = input\_blue\_col + 1
6. **Populate Column:** Fill all rows of column x of the output grid with blue pixels.

This refined program incorporates the observed behavior from all the training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
