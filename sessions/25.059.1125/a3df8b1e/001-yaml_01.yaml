facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    properties:
      - height: Consistent between input and output for each pair.
      - width: Input width varies (2, 3, 4). Output width seems related.
      - colors: Primarily white (0) and blue (1).
  - type: object
    description: A single blue pixel in the input.
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1)
      - position: Located in the bottom row of the input grid.
      - movement: Its position influences the output pattern.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid is generated based on the input grid.
    properties:
      - pattern: Alternating blue and white pixels in the output.
      - width_relation: output grid width is equal to the input grid width.
      - height relation: output grid height is equal to the input grid height.
      - blue_pixel_shift:  The blue pixel's initial position dictates the output pattern's starting point.
