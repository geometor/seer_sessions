The input grid consists primarily of '0' values (white), with a single '1' value (blue) near the bottom. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input but has an alternating pattern of '0' (white) and '1' (blue) values in each column. The position of the initial blue pixel in the input seems to dictate the starting point of the alternating pattern in the corresponding column of the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Create an output grid of the same dimensions.\n2. **Find Blue:** locate the row where the blue pixel occurs in the input.\n2.  **Column-wise Alternation:** For each column in the output grid:\n    *   If the column index is even, set the pixel in the first row to 0.\n    *   If the column index is odd, set the pixel in the first row to 1.\n    * fill the first column where the blue pixel by starting at 0.\n    * fill the second column by starting at 1.\n    *   For each subsequent row, alternate the value from the previous row (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation creates a checkerboard-like pattern, by making alternating columns have opposing values, which are opposite, and each of which alternate from row to row.\n"
