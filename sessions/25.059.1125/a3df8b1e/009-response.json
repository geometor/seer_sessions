The primary colors involved are white (0) and blue (1). The input grid contains a single blue pixel at the bottom left (1, 0, 0). The output grid seems to \"oscillate\" the blue pixel, creating a repeating pattern. The single blue pixel in the input appears to be replicated and moved in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
