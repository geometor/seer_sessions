Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions.\n*   **Colors/Numbers:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (1-8), representing a specific color.\n*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation seems to involve replacing some of the numbers/colors with '5' (gray). The numbers that are not 1 or 8 are changed to 5.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
