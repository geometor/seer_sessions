The transformation seems to involve replicating certain colored pixels in specific patterns, specifically along diagonals. There appear to be \"source\" pixels which are then used to generate the new repeated pixels, almost as if they are \"extending\" or \"casting\" diagonally. The background (0, or white pixels) remain largely untouched, except where overridden by the pattern extensions.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

These are the \"source\" pixels.\n2.  **Iterate by color, then by pixel:** loop through all of the non-zero colors, for each color loop through the source pixels.\n3.  **Horizontal Extension:** For each color, create a horizontal extension to the left and right.\n    *   extend one cell at a time\n    *   if a color is present at the cell location, check if the color matches the current color.\n        *  If colors match, stop extension\n        *  If colors do not match, continue to next cell\n4.  **Vertical Extension**\n    *  For colors 1 (blue), 2(red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), and 8 (azure) repeat the horizontal extension vertically.\n        *   Use the same rules as the horizontal extension\n\nThis program captures the core logic: identifying non-zero pixels, extending them, and replacing 0s with color values along alternating diagonals. The order of pixel processing/color processing doesn't seem significant. The extension appears unlimited in these three examples, but bounded by the grid size. The different colors extensions do not interact or overwrite each other.\n"
