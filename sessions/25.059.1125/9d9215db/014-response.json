The new vertical (y) position is calculated as `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`. The original yellow pixel is removed.\n\n4.  **Blue Pixel Mirroring and Expansion:**\n    *   Each blue pixel is first mirrored across the horizontal center line, calculated as `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.\n    * The original blue pixel is removed.\n    *   The mirrored blue pixel then expands horizontally, filling all cells from x=3 to x=15 (inclusive) with blue.\n\n5.  **Order of Transformations**: The order of operations is crucial for correct results, to prevent color changes impacting subsequent logic:\n    a. Green Pixel Movement\n    b. Yellow Pixel Mirroring\n    c. Blue Pixel Mirroring and Expansion\n\n6. **White Pixels**: White pixels remain unchanged throughout the entire process.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    grid_height = output_grid.shape[0]\n    center_y = grid_height // 2\n\n    # Create a temporary grid to store intermediate changes\n    temp_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Green Pixel Movement\n    for y in range(grid_height):\n        for x in range(grid_width):\n            if input_grid[y, x] == 3:\n                temp_grid[y,x] = 0\n                if y < center_y:\n                    temp_grid[y + 1, x] = 3\n                elif y > center_y:\n                    temp_grid[y - 1, x] = 3\n    \n    # copy temp to output\n    output_grid = np.copy(temp_grid)\n\n    # Yellow Pixel Mirroring\n    for y in range(grid_height):\n        for x in range(grid_width):\n            if temp_grid[y, x] == 4:\n                new_y = (grid_height - 1) - y\n                output_grid[y,x] = 0  # Clear original\n                output_grid[new_y, x] = 4\n\n    # copy output to temp for next operation\n    temp_grid = np.copy(output_grid)\n                \n    # Blue Pixel Mirroring and Expansion\n    for y in range(grid_height):\n        for x in range(grid_width):\n            if temp_grid[y, x] == 1:\n                new_y = (grid_height - 1) - y\n                output_grid[y,x]=0 # Clear original\n                for i in range(3, 16):  # Expand horizontally\n                    output_grid[new_y, i] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
