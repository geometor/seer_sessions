Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Green Pixel Movement:** Every green pixel (value 3) moves one step vertically *towards* the center of the grid.
    *   If a green pixel is above the horizontal center line, it moves one step down.
    *   If a green pixel is below the horizontal center line, it moves one step up.
    * If the green pixel is on the horizontal center line, it remains.

2.  **Yellow Pixel Mirroring:** Every yellow pixel (value 4) is mirrored across the horizontal center line of the grid. The new vertical (y) position is calculated as `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.

3.  **Blue Pixel Mirroring and Expansion:** Every blue pixel (value 1) is:
    *   First mirrored across the horizontal center line, using the same formula as the yellow pixels: `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.
    *   Then, the mirrored blue pixel is expanded horizontally, filling all cells from x=3 to x=15 (inclusive) with the blue color.

4. **Order of operations**: The order of changes is important. Green moves. Yellow mirrors. Blue mirrors and expands.

5.  All other pixels remain unchanged. Specifically, white pixels stay white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
