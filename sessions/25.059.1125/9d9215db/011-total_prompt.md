Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Green Pixel Movement:** For each green pixel (3) in the input, move its y position. if the original y position is less than the center Y, increase the y by one. If the original y position if greater than the center Y, reduce it by one.

2.  **Blue and Yellow Pixel Mirroring:** Identify the central horizontal axis of the grid (y=9). For the blue (1) and yellow(4) pixels , mirror their position across this central axis. The new y-coordinate will be `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`

3. **Blue Pixel Expansion**: For each original and newly mirrored blue pixel, create copies of it by repeating the blue color to the left until the x coordinate 3 and right until the x coordinate 15.

4.  All other cells remain unchanged (value 0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
