The new vertical (y) position is calculated as `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.\n\n3.  **Blue Pixel Mirroring and Expansion:** Every blue pixel (value 1) is:\n    *   First mirrored across the horizontal center line, using the same formula as the yellow pixels: `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.\n    *   Then, the mirrored blue pixel is expanded horizontally, filling all cells from x=3 to x=15 (inclusive) with the blue color.\n\n4. **Order of operations**: The order of changes is important. Green moves. Yellow mirrors. Blue mirrors and expands.\n\n5.  All other pixels remain unchanged.
