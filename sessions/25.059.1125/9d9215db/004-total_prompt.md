Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, each representing a color. The input grid transforms into the output grid, suggesting a rule-based manipulation of the grid elements. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), blue (1), and red (2). The transformation doesn't appear to be a simple global operation (like changing all 1s to 2s) but seems context-dependent, potentially based on the positions and neighbors of the pixels. It also seems like vertical mirroring may be happening, or some operation that mimics this.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 19x19
      elements: pixels
      colors: [white, azure, blue, red]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: Duplicate a pattern of pixels.
  - name: extend
    description: Extend the existing colored pixels vertically.
  - name: fill
    description: Fill the areas between existing pattern with a selected color based on existing colors.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - type: symmetry
    description: horizontal extension based on position

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pattern:** Locate the initial colored pixels in the input grid. In this case, there is one azure pixel, two blue pixels and one red pixel.

2.  **Vertical Extension:** Every other column, excluding the first and last, contain the blue pixels.

3. **Fill azure:** Fill every other remaining empty spot in the second and last row with azure.

4. **Fill remaining blue and red in pattern:** Use a combination of the input pixels and the vertically extended blue pixels to fill the remaining areas to complete the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
