Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grid Composition**: Each input grid contains a background of White (0), a small object composed of Azure (8) pixels, and another small object composed of Red (2) pixels.
2.  **Object Placement**:
    *   In `train_1`, the Azure object is a 2x1 vertical line in column 1. The Red object is a 1x2 horizontal line in row 3.
    *   In `train_2`, the Azure object is a 2x1 vertical line in column 4. The Red object is a 1x2 horizontal line in row 2.
3.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grid retains the White (0) background but introduces significant changes based on the input objects. The Azure and Red pixels form complete lines (one horizontal, one vertical) that intersect.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**:
    *   The column containing the input Azure object becomes a full-height Azure (8) line in the output, *except* at the intersection point.
    *   The row containing the input Red object becomes a full-width Red (2) line in the output, *except* at the intersection point.
    *   The single pixel where the projected Azure column and Red row intersect is colored Yellow (4).
    *   The original shapes/sizes of the input Azure and Red objects do not seem to directly transfer; they only serve to define the target row and column for the transformation.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: >
  The task transforms an input grid containing distinct Azure (8) and Red (2) objects on a White (0) background.
  The transformation involves projecting lines based on the positions of these objects and coloring their intersection uniquely.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 6x6 in examples).
  - background_color: White (0).

input_objects:
  - object_type: Azure Object
    color: 8 (Azure)
    properties:
      - Small shape (line or rectangle in examples).
      - Its position defines a specific column index ('target_col').
      - All Azure pixels are found in a single column.
  - object_type: Red Object
    color: 2 (Red)
    properties:
      - Small shape (line or rectangle in examples).
      - Its position defines a specific row index ('target_row').
      - All Red pixels are found in a single row.

output_pattern:
  - pattern_type: Cross Intersection
    elements:
      - type: Vertical Line
        color: 8 (Azure)
        location: Fills the 'target_col' entirely, except for the intersection point.
      - type: Horizontal Line
        color: 2 (Red)
        location: Fills the 'target_row' entirely, except for the intersection point.
      - type: Intersection Point
        color: 4 (Yellow)
        location: At coordinates ('target_row', 'target_col').
      - type: Background
        color: 0 (White)
        location: All cells not part of the vertical line, horizontal line, or intersection point.

relationships:
  - The column index of the input Azure object determines the column for the output Azure line.
  - The row index of the input Red object determines the row for the output Red line.
  - The intersection of the determined row and column receives a unique color (Yellow, 4).
  - The original input Azure and Red objects are effectively replaced by these generated lines.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (White, 0).
2.  Scan the input grid to find any pixel with the color Azure (8). Determine the column index of this pixel. Store this as `target_col`. (Assumption based on examples: all input Azure pixels will share the same column).
3.  Scan the input grid to find any pixel with the color Red (2). Determine the row index of this pixel. Store this as `target_row`. (Assumption based on examples: all input Red pixels will share the same row).
4.  Iterate through all cells `(r, c)` of the output grid:
    a.  If the current cell's row index `r` equals `target_row` AND the column index `c` equals `target_col`, set the cell's color to Yellow (4).
    b.  Else if the current cell's row index `r` equals `target_row`, set the cell's color to Red (2).
    c.  Else if the current cell's column index `c` equals `target_col`, set the cell's color to Azure (8).
    d.  Otherwise, the cell retains its initial background color (White, 0).
5.  Return the completed output grid.
