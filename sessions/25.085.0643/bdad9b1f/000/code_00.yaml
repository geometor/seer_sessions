task_description: >
  The task transforms an input grid containing distinct Azure (8) and Red (2) objects on a White (0) background.
  The transformation involves projecting lines based on the positions of these objects and coloring their intersection uniquely.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Consistent between input and output (e.g., 6x6 in examples).
  - background_color: White (0).

input_objects:
  - object_type: Azure Object
    color: 8 (Azure)
    properties:
      - Small shape (line or rectangle in examples).
      - Its position defines a specific column index ('target_col').
      - All Azure pixels are found in a single column.
  - object_type: Red Object
    color: 2 (Red)
    properties:
      - Small shape (line or rectangle in examples).
      - Its position defines a specific row index ('target_row').
      - All Red pixels are found in a single row.

output_pattern:
  - pattern_type: Cross Intersection
    elements:
      - type: Vertical Line
        color: 8 (Azure)
        location: Fills the 'target_col' entirely, except for the intersection point.
      - type: Horizontal Line
        color: 2 (Red)
        location: Fills the 'target_row' entirely, except for the intersection point.
      - type: Intersection Point
        color: 4 (Yellow)
        location: At coordinates ('target_row', 'target_col').
      - type: Background
        color: 0 (White)
        location: All cells not part of the vertical line, horizontal line, or intersection point.

relationships:
  - The column index of the input Azure object determines the column for the output Azure line.
  - The row index of the input Red object determines the row for the output Red line.
  - The intersection of the determined row and column receives a unique color (Yellow, 4).
  - The original input Azure and Red objects are effectively replaced by these generated lines.
