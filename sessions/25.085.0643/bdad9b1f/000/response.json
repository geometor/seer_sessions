The Red object is a 1x2 horizontal line in row 3.\n    *   In `train_2`, the Azure object is a 2x1 vertical line in column 4. The Red object is a 1x2 horizontal line in row 2.\n3.  **Output Grid Composition**: The output grid retains the White (0) background but introduces significant changes based on the input objects. The Azure and Red pixels form complete lines (one horizontal, one vertical) that intersect.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**:\n    *   The column containing the input Azure object becomes a full-height Azure (8) line in the output, *except* at the intersection point.\n    *   The row containing the input Red object becomes a full-width Red (2) line in the output, *except* at the intersection point.\n    *   The single pixel where the projected Azure column and Red row intersect is colored Yellow (4).\n    *   The original shapes/sizes of the input Azure and Red objects do not seem to directly transfer; they only serve to define the target row and column for the transformation.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
