**Revised Analysis Based on Metrics:**

1.  **Shape:** Input and output shapes are identical for all examples.
2.  **Color Counts:**
    *   Example 1: Input (10 gray, 15 magenta). Output (15 white, 10 magenta).
    *   Example 2: Input (5 gray, 4 yellow). Output (4 white, 5 yellow).
    *   Example 3: Input (7 gray, 18 maroon). Output (18 white, 7 maroon).
    *   Observation: The number of gray pixels in the input becomes the number of *non-white* pixels (magenta/yellow/maroon) in the output. The number of *non-gray* pixels in the input becomes the number of white pixels in the output. This suggests a swap.
3.  **Coordinate Mapping:**
    *   Let's compare `input_gray_coords` with `output_other_coords` and `input_other_coords` with `output_white_coords`.
    *   Example 1: `input_gray_coords` == `output_other_coords`. `input_other_coords` == `output_white_coords`.
    *   Example 2: `input_gray_coords` == `output_other_coords`. `input_other_coords` == `output_white_coords`.
    *   Example 3: `input_gray_coords` == `output_other_coords`. `input_other_coords` == `output_white_coords`.
    *   Observation: This confirms the pattern. The locations that were gray in the input become the locations of the *other* color in the output. The locations that had the *other* color in the input become white (0) in the output.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

The transformation swaps the pixel values based on their color. All pixels that are gray (5) in the input grid become the *other* color present in the input grid. All pixels that are the *other* color in the input grid become white (0).

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code failed because it only considered changing gray to white, ignoring the behavior of the other color present. The metrics clearly show a swapping pattern: gray pixels take on the identity (color) of the non-gray pixels, and the non-gray pixels become white.

The strategy is to:
1. Identify the two colors present in the input grid: gray (5) and the 'other' color.
2. Create a new output grid.
3. Iterate through the input grid.
4. If a pixel is gray (5), set the corresponding output pixel to the 'other' color.
5. If a pixel is the 'other' color, set the corresponding output pixel to white (0).
6. If a pixel is neither (though this doesn't occur in the examples), it should probably remain unchanged (or this case needs clarification if it's possible). The current examples only show two colors per grid.

**Facts (YAML):**

```yaml
task_description: Transforms a grid by swapping pixel colors based on initial values.
grid_properties:
  - size: Remains constant between input and output.
  - background_color: Assumed to be white (0), as it appears in the output where non-gray colors were.
objects:
  - object_type: pixel_set
    color_name: gray
    value: 5
    description: One of the two colors present in the input.
  - object_type: pixel_set
    color_name: other
    value: variable (e.g., magenta(6), yellow(4), maroon(9))
    description: The second color present in the input, which is not gray.
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: gray_color (5), other_color (variable)
    description: Determine the two distinct colors present in the input grid.
  - action: swap_pixels
    input: input_grid, gray_color, other_color
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
      If the pixel value is gray (5), change it to the identified 'other_color' in the output grid.
      If the pixel value is the 'other_color', change it to white (0) in the output grid.
      Ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid. One color will always be gray (5), call the second color `other_color`.
2.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  For each pixel in the input grid:
    a.  If the pixel's color is gray (5), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to `other_color`.
    b.  If the pixel's color is `other_color`, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to white (0).
4.  Return the new grid.
