task_description: Transforms a grid by swapping pixel colors based on initial values.
grid_properties:
  - size: Remains constant between input and output.
  - background_color: Assumed to be white (0), as it appears in the output where non-gray colors were.
objects:
  - object_type: pixel_set
    color_name: gray
    value: 5
    description: One of the two colors present in the input.
  - object_type: pixel_set
    color_name: other
    value: variable (e.g., magenta(6), yellow(4), maroon(9))
    description: The second color present in the input, which is not gray.
actions:
  - action: identify_colors
    input: input_grid
    output: gray_color (5), other_color (variable)
    description: Determine the two distinct colors present in the input grid.
  - action: swap_pixels
    input: input_grid, gray_color, other_color
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
      If the pixel value is gray (5), change it to the identified 'other_color' in the output grid.
      If the pixel value is the 'other_color', change it to white (0) in the output grid.
      Ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
