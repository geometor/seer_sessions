            "text": "**Revised Analysis Based on Metrics:**\n\n1.  **Shape:** Input and output shapes are identical for all examples.\n2.  **Color Counts:**\n    *   Example 1: Input (10 gray, 15 magenta). Output (15 white, 10 magenta).\n    *   Example 2: Input (5 gray, 4 yellow). Output (4 white, 5 yellow).\n    *   Example 3: Input (7 gray, 18 maroon). Output (18 white, 7 maroon).\n    *   Observation: The number of gray pixels in the input becomes the number of *non-white* pixels (magenta/yellow/maroon) in the output. The number of *non-gray* pixels in the input becomes the number of white pixels in the output. This suggests a swap.\n3.  **Coordinate Mapping:**\n    *   Let's compare `input_gray_coords` with `output_other_coords` and `input_other_coords` with `output_white_coords`.\n    *   Example 1: `input_gray_coords` == `output_other_coords`. `input_other_coords` == `output_white_coords`.\n    *   Example 2: `input_gray_coords` == `output_other_coords`. `input_other_coords` == `output_white_coords`.\n    *   Example 3: `input_gray_coords` == `output_other_coords`. `input_other_coords` == `output_white_coords`.\n    *   Observation: This confirms the pattern. The locations that were gray in the input become the locations of the *other* color in the output. The locations that had the *other* color in the input become white (0) in the output.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation swaps the pixel values based on their color. All pixels that are gray (5) in the input grid become the *other* color present in the input grid. All pixels that are the *other* color in the input grid become white (0).\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code failed because it only considered changing gray to white, ignoring the behavior of the other color present. The metrics clearly show a swapping pattern: gray pixels take on the identity (color) of the non-gray pixels, and the non-gray pixels become white.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1. Identify the two colors present in the input grid: gray (5) and the 'other' color.\n2. Create a new output grid.\n3. Iterate through the input grid.\n4. If a pixel is gray (5), set the corresponding output pixel to the 'other' color.\n5. If a pixel is the 'other' color, set the corresponding output pixel to white (0).\n6. If a pixel is neither (though this doesn't occur in the examples), it should probably remain unchanged (or this case needs clarification if it's possible). The current examples only show two colors per grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n"
