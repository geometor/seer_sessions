The color varies from column to column.\n    *   The transformation changes the color of each column. The specific color change applied to a column depends solely on the original color of that column.\n    *   Comparing the color changes across examples reveals a consistent mapping:\n        *   gray (5) maps to blue (1)\n        *   azure (8) maps to maroon (9)\n        *   magenta (6) maps to red (2)\n        *   red (2) maps to magenta (6)\n        *   green (3) maps to yellow (4)\n        *   maroon (9) maps to azure (8)\n        *   yellow (4) maps to green (3)\n        *   blue (1) maps to gray (5)\n    *   This suggests a pixel-wise color substitution based on a fixed mapping rule. The structure of the grid (uniform columns) is preserved, only the colors change according to this rule.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
