*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids in all examples are 3x3.
    *   In both input and output grids, each column consists of pixels of a single, uniform color. The color varies from column to column.
    *   The transformation changes the color of each column. The specific color change applied to a column depends solely on the original color of that column.
    *   Comparing the color changes across examples reveals a consistent mapping:
        *   gray (5) maps to blue (1)
        *   azure (8) maps to maroon (9)
        *   magenta (6) maps to red (2)
        *   red (2) maps to magenta (6)
        *   green (3) maps to yellow (4)
        *   maroon (9) maps to azure (8)
        *   yellow (4) maps to green (3)
        *   blue (1) maps to gray (5)
    *   This suggests a pixel-wise color substitution based on a fixed mapping rule. The structure of the grid (uniform columns) is preserved, only the colors change according to this rule.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_properties:
      - input_size: 3x3
      - output_size: 3x3
      - uniformity: Both input and output grids have columns where all pixels share the same color.
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: an integer value from 1 to 9 (in these examples)
    actions:
      - name: color_substitution
        input: pixel_color (integer)
        output: new_pixel_color (integer)
        rule: A fixed mapping applied to each pixel's color.
    relationships:
      - type: color_mapping
        details: |
          A consistent, one-to-one mapping exists between input colors and output colors across all examples:
          1 -> 5
          2 -> 6
          3 -> 4
          4 -> 3
          5 -> 1
          6 -> 2
          8 -> 9
          9 -> 8
          (Mappings for 0 and 7 are not observed in the examples)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    3.  For each pixel, determine its color value.
    4.  Apply the following fixed color substitution rule to the pixel's color value:
        *   If the color is blue (1), change it to gray (5).
        *   If the color is red (2), change it to magenta (6).
        *   If the color is green (3), change it to yellow (4).
        *   If the color is yellow (4), change it to green (3).
        *   If the color is gray (5), change it to blue (1).
        *   If the color is magenta (6), change it to red (2).
        *   If the color is azure (8), change it to maroon (9).
        *   If the color is maroon (9), change it to azure (8).
        *   (Assume colors 0 and 7 remain unchanged if encountered, although they are not present in the training examples).
    5.  Place the resulting new color value in the corresponding position in the new grid.
    6.  The new grid is the output.
