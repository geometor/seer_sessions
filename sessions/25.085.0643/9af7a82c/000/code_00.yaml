Input:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - contains pixels of various colors (0-9)
    - dimensions vary (height H, width W)

Output:
  type: grid
  properties:
    - derived from input grid's color counts and sorting
    - width equals the number of unique non-white colors in the input
    - height depends on the maximum color count (MaxCount) and input dimensions (H, W):
        - height = MaxCount if MaxCount >= (H * W / 2)
        - height = MaxCount + 1 otherwise
    - contains vertical bars representing sorted colors
    - background color is white (0)

Transformation:
  - name: Color Frequency Histogram Generation
  - steps:
    1. Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
    2. Count the total occurrences (frequency) of each unique non-white color across the entire input grid.
    3. Determine the maximum frequency (MaxCount) among all counted colors.
    4. Calculate the output grid height:
       - If MaxCount >= (InputHeight * InputWidth / 2), OutputHeight = MaxCount.
       - Otherwise, OutputHeight = MaxCount + 1.
    5. Sort the unique non-white colors based on two criteria:
       - Primary: Frequency (descending).
       - Secondary: Color value (ascending). Let the sorted list be SortedColors.
    6. Determine the output grid width: OutputWidth = number of unique non-white colors (length of SortedColors).
    7. Create an empty output grid of size OutputHeight x OutputWidth, filled with white (0).
    8. Iterate through the SortedColors list. For each color C at index j (0-based):
       - Retrieve its frequency N from the counts determined in step 2.
       - Fill the first N cells (rows 0 to N-1) of column j in the output grid with color C.
