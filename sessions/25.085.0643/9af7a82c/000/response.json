            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input & Output Grids:** The task takes a small input grid and produces a potentially larger output grid. The output grid's dimensions seem dependent on the content of the input grid, specifically the colors present and their frequencies.\n2.  **Color Analysis:** The core operation seems to involve analyzing the non-white (non-zero) colors within the input grid. White pixels (0) in the input seem to be ignored.\n3.  **Counting:** The frequency (count) of each unique non-white color in the input grid appears crucial.\n4.  **Sorting:** The unique non-white colors seem to be sorted based on certain criteria to determine the structure of the output. Observing the examples suggests a primary sort key of frequency (descending) and a secondary sort key of color value (ascending).\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid resembles a vertical histogram or bar chart.\n    *   **Columns:** Each column in the output corresponds to one of the unique non-white colors found in the input, ordered according to the sorting rule identified above.\n    *   **Column Content:** Each column `j` (corresponding to sorted color `C`) is filled from the top with `N` pixels of color `C`, where `N` is the total count of color `C` in the *entire* input grid. The remaining cells below these `N` pixels in that column are filled with white (0).\n    *   **Dimensions:**\n        *   The width of the output grid is equal to the number of unique non-white colors in the input.\n        *   The height of the output grid seems related to the maximum frequency (`MaxCount`) of any single color. Specifically, it appears to be `MaxCount` if `MaxCount` is greater than or equal to half the total number of cells in the input grid (`InputHeight * InputWidth / 2`), and `MaxCount + 1` otherwise.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Calculate a threshold value equal to half the total number of cells in the input grid (input height times input width, divided by 2).\n5.  Determine the height of the output grid: if `MaxCount` is greater than or equal to the threshold, the output height is `MaxCount`; otherwise, the output height is `MaxCount + 1`.\n6.  Arrange the unique non-white colors in a specific order: first, sort them from highest count to lowest count. If two colors have the same count, sort them by their color value from lowest to highest. This ordered list determines the sequence of columns in the output.\n7.  Determine the width of the output grid: it is equal to the total number of unique non-white colors found in step 1.\n8.
