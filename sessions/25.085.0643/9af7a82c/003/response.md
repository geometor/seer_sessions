Transforms the input grid by creating a vertical histogram of its non-white colors, sorted by frequency and then color value.
The height of the histogram is determined by a rule involving the maximum color frequency and the input grid dimensions.

1.  Scan the input grid to identify all unique non-white colors (colors 1 through 9) and count the occurrences (frequency) of each.
2.  If no non-white colors are found, create and return a 1x1 output grid containing only white (0).
3.  Determine the maximum frequency (`max_count`) among all counted non-white colors.
4.  Calculate a `threshold` value equal to half the total number of cells in the input grid (input height * input width / 2.0).
5.  Count the number of distinct non-white colors found (`num_unique_colors`).
6.  Determine the output grid's height:
    a.  If `max_count` is greater than or equal to the `threshold`, the output height is `max_count`.
    b.  If `max_count` is less than the `threshold`, check if `num_unique_colors` is equal to the input grid's height (H).
        i.  If `num_unique_colors` equals H, the output height is `max_count`.
        ii. If `num_unique_colors` does not equal H, the output height is `max_count + 1`.
    c. Ensure the calculated height is at least 1 if there are non-white colors.
7.  Determine the output grid's width, which is equal to `num_unique_colors`.
8.  Create a new grid (the output grid) with the calculated height and width, initially filled with white (0).
9.  Sort the unique non-white colors based on their frequency (highest first). If two colors have the same frequency, sort them by their color value (lowest first).
10. For each color in the sorted list, corresponding to a column index `j` (starting from 0):
    a.  Get the frequency count (`c`) for that color.
    b.  Fill the cells in column `j` of the output grid from the top row (row 0) down to row `min(c, output_height) - 1` with that color's value.
11. Return the resulting output grid.
