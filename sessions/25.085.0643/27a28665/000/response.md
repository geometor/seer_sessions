*   **Perception:** The task takes a 3x3 grid as input and produces a single integer as output. All input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and exactly one other color, forming a pattern. The output integer seems to depend on the geometric properties of the pattern formed by the non-background color.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The input grids are always 3x3.
    *   The output is always a single integer (1, 2, 3, or 6).
    *   The specific non-background color (blue, azure, gray, yellow) does not directly determine the output, as different colors can produce the same output (e.g., train\_1 blue -> 3, train\_2 azure -> 3) and the same color can produce different outputs (e.g., train\_3 gray -> 6, train\_5 gray -> 2, train\_7 gray -> 1).
    *   The number of non-background pixels doesn't directly map to the output (e.g., train\_1 has 5 pixels -> 3, train\_3 has 6 pixels -> 6, train\_4 has 5 pixels -> 2).
    *   The key appears to be the rotational symmetry of the pattern formed by the non-background pixels.
        *   Patterns with 4-way rotational symmetry (like the plus sign in train\_3) output 6.
        *   Patterns with 2-way rotational symmetry (like the checkerboard in train\_4 and train\_5) output 2.
        *   Patterns with no rotational symmetry (asymmetric) output either 1 or 3.
    *   To distinguish between the asymmetric cases:
        *   The L-shape patterns (train\_1, train\_2) output 3. These patterns contain a 2x2 square filled with the non-background color.
        *   The diagonal/corner patterns (train\_6, train\_7) output 1. These patterns do *not* contain a 2x2 square filled with the non-background color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    input_type: 3x3 grid
    output_type: single integer
    input_elements:
      - background_pixels: color white (0)
      - pattern_pixels: single non-white color per grid
    output_determination: based on geometric properties of the pattern_pixels
    properties:
      - rotational_symmetry:
          - 4-way (90 degrees)
          - 2-way (180 degrees)
          - asymmetric (no rotational symmetry)
      - sub_pattern: presence or absence of a 2x2 block of pattern_pixels
    relationships:
      - 4-way symmetry maps to output 6
      - 2-way symmetry maps to output 2
      - asymmetry maps to output 1 or 3
      - asymmetric patterns containing a 2x2 block map to output 3
      - asymmetric patterns not containing a 2x2 block map to output 1

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the pattern formed by the non-white pixels in the input 3x3 grid.
    2.  Determine the rotational symmetry of this pattern.
    3.  If the pattern has 4-way rotational symmetry (looks the same after 90, 180, 270 degree rotations), the output is 6.
    4.  Else, if the pattern has 2-way rotational symmetry (looks the same after a 180 degree rotation, but not 90/270), the output is 2.
    5.  Else (the pattern is asymmetric), check if there exists any 2x2 subgrid within the input grid that consists entirely of the non-white pattern pixels.
    6.  If such a 2x2 subgrid exists, the output is 3.
    7.  Otherwise (asymmetric and no 2x2 subgrid of the pattern color), the output is 1.
