All input grids contain a background color (white, 0) and exactly one other color, forming a pattern. The output integer seems to depend on the geometric properties of the pattern formed by the non-background color.\n\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The input grids are always 3x3.\n    *   The output is always a single integer (1, 2, 3, or 6).\n    *   The specific non-background color (blue, azure, gray, yellow) does not directly determine the output, as different colors can produce the same output (e.g., train\\_1 blue -> 3, train\\_2 azure -> 3) and the same color can produce different outputs (e.g., train\\_3 gray -> 6, train\\_5 gray -> 2, train\\_7 gray -> 1).\n    *   The number of non-background pixels doesn't directly map to the output (e.g., train\\_1 has 5 pixels -> 3, train\\_3 has 6 pixels -> 6, train\\_4 has 5 pixels -> 2).\n    *   The key appears to be the rotational symmetry of the pattern formed by the non-background pixels.\n        *   Patterns with 4-way rotational symmetry (like the plus sign in train\\_3) output 6.\n        *   Patterns with 2-way rotational symmetry (like the checkerboard in train\\_4 and train\\_5) output 2.\n        *   Patterns with no rotational symmetry (asymmetric) output either 1 or 3.\n    *   To distinguish between the asymmetric cases:\n        *   The L-shape patterns (train\\_1, train\\_2) output 3. These patterns contain a 2x2 square filled with the non-background color.\n        *   The diagonal/corner patterns (train\\_6, train\\_7) output 1. These patterns do *not* contain a 2x2 square filled with the non-background color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
