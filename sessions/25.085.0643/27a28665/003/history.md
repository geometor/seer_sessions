Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a single integer based on the rotational symmetry and structure of the non-white pattern.

1. Identify the pattern formed by the non-white pixels in the input 3x3 grid.
2. Determine the rotational symmetry of this pattern.
3. If the pattern has 4-way rotational symmetry (looks the same after 90, 180, 270 degree rotations), the output is 6.
4. Else, if the pattern has 2-way rotational symmetry (looks the same after a 180 degree rotation, but not 90/270), the output is 2.
5. Else (the pattern is asymmetric), check if there exists any 2x2 subgrid within the input grid that consists entirely of the non-white pattern pixels.
6. If such a 2x2 subgrid exists, the output is 3.
7. Otherwise (asymmetric and no 2x2 subgrid of the pattern color), the output is 1.

## General Assessment

The previous code successfully identified a potential logic involving rotational symmetry and the presence of 2x2 blocks. However, it failed on examples 4 and 5, both of which have 4-way rotational symmetry ('X' shape) but expected an output of 2, whereas the code assigned them an output of 6 based on the initial rule for 4-way symmetry. This indicates the rule needs refinement to distinguish between different types of 4-way symmetric patterns or to adjust the conditions leading to outputs 2 and 6.

The strategy will be to re-evaluate the properties of the grids, focusing on the specific shapes associated with each output, especially for the symmetric cases. We will refine the natural language program to capture these more specific conditions.

## Metrics and Analysis

We will re-examine each example based on the proposed revised logic: specific pattern shapes ('+' or 'X'), asymmetry, and the presence of a 2x2 block of the pattern color.

| Example | Input Grid                    | Pattern Color | Shape / Properties          | Expected Output | Previous Output | Correct? | Analysis                                                                 |
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | `[[0,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0]]`   | 1 (blue)      | Asymmetric, Has 2x2 block   | 3               | 3               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric with a 2x2 block.                     |
| 2       | `[[0,8,8],[0,8,8],[8,0,0]]`   | 8 (azure)     | Asymmetric, Has 2x2 block   | 3               | 3               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric with a 2x2 block.                     |
| 3       | `[[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]]`   | 5 (gray)      | 4-way Symmetric ('+' shape) | 6               | 6               | Yes      | Correctly identified based on symmetry (implicitly, the '+' shape).      |
| 4       | `[[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]]`   | 8 (azure)     | 4-way Symmetric ('X' shape) | 2               | 6               | No       | Incorrectly classified. Has 4-way symmetry but is an 'X' shape, not '+'. |
| 5       | `[[5,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,5]]`   | 5 (gray)      | 4-way Symmetric ('X' shape) | 2               | 6               | No       | Incorrectly classified. Has 4-way symmetry but is an 'X' shape, not '+'. |
| 6       | `[[4,4,0],[4,0,4],[0,4,0]]`   | 4 (yellow)    | Asymmetric, No 2x2 block    | 1               | 1               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric without a 2x2 block.                  |
| 7       | `[[5,5,0],[5,0,5],[0,5,0]]`   | 5 (gray)      | Asymmetric, No 2x2 block    | 1               | 1               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric without a 2x2 block.                  |

The analysis confirms that the distinction between the '+' shape (output 6) and the 'X' shape (output 2) is crucial. Both possess 4-way rotational symmetry, but lead to different outputs. The rules for asymmetric patterns (output 1 or 3 based on 2x2 block presence) remain consistent.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Pattern:** Examine the 3x3 input grid and determine the single non-white color (let's call it `pattern_color`).
2.  **Check for '+' Shape:** Compare the input grid to a template representing a '+' shape centered in the grid, using the identified `pattern_color`. The '+' template is:
    
```
    white, pattern_color, white
    pattern_color, pattern_color, pattern_color
    white, pattern_color, white
    ```

    If the input grid matches this template exactly, the output is 6.
3.  **Check for 'X' Shape:** If it's not a '+' shape, compare the input grid to a template representing an 'X' shape (diagonal cross) centered in the grid, using the `pattern_color`. The 'X' template is:
    
```
    pattern_color, white, pattern_color
    white, pattern_color, white
    pattern_color, white, pattern_color
    ```

    If the input grid matches this template exactly, the output is 2.
4.  **Check for 2x2 Block:** If the input grid matches neither the '+' nor the 'X' shape template, examine all four possible 2x2 subgrids within the 3x3 input grid. Determine if any of these 2x2 subgrids consist entirely of the `pattern_color`.
5.  **Determine Output for Asymmetric/Other Cases:**
    *   If a 2x2 block of `pattern_color` was found in step 4, the output is 3.
    *   If no 2x2 block of `pattern_color` was found in step 4, the output is 1.
