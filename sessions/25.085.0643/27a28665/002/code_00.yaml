task_description: Identify a specific property of the pattern formed by non-white pixels in a 3x3 grid and output a corresponding integer code (1, 2, 3, or 6).

grid_properties:
  - size: 3x3
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - pattern_color: The single non-white color present in the grid.

objects:
  - object: pattern
    definition: The set of connected or disconnected pixels matching the pattern_color.
    properties:
      - shape: The geometric arrangement of the pattern pixels.
      - symmetry: Rotational symmetry (4-way, 2-way, or asymmetric).
      - contains_2x2_block: Whether a 2x2 subgrid exists composed entirely of the pattern_color.

transformation_rules:
  - rule_1:
      condition: The pattern perfectly matches the '+' shape template `[[0, C, 0], [C, C, C], [0, C, 0]]`, where C is the pattern_color.
      output: 6
  - rule_2:
      condition: The pattern perfectly matches the 'X' shape template `[[C, 0, C], [0, C, 0], [C, 0, C]]`, where C is the pattern_color.
      output: 2
  - rule_3:
      condition: The pattern does not match the '+' or 'X' shape templates, AND it contains at least one 2x2 block composed entirely of the pattern_color.
      output: 3
  - rule_4:
      condition: The pattern does not match the '+' or 'X' shape templates, AND it does not contain any 2x2 block composed entirely of the pattern_color.
      output: 1

output_properties:
  - type: Single integer.
  - possible_values: [1, 2, 3, 6]
