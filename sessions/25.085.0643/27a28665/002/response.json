            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified a potential logic involving rotational symmetry and the presence of 2x2 blocks. However, it failed on examples 4 and 5, both of which have 4-way rotational symmetry ('X' shape) but expected an output of 2, whereas the code assigned them an output of 6 based on the initial rule for 4-way symmetry. This indicates the rule needs refinement to distinguish between different types of 4-way symmetric patterns or to adjust the conditions leading to outputs 2 and 6.\n\nThe strategy will be to re-evaluate the properties of the grids, focusing on the specific shapes associated with each output, especially for the symmetric cases. We will refine the natural language program to capture these more specific conditions.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nWe will re-examine each example based on the proposed revised logic: specific pattern shapes ('+' or 'X'), asymmetry, and the presence of a 2x2 block of the pattern color.\n\n| Example | Input Grid                    | Pattern Color | Shape / Properties          | Expected Output | Previous Output | Correct? | Analysis                                                                 |\n| :------ | :---------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | `[[0,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0]]`   | 1 (blue)      | Asymmetric, Has 2x2 block   | 3               | 3               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric with a 2x2 block.                     |\n| 2       | `[[0,8,8],[0,8,8],[8,0,0]]`   | 8 (azure)     | Asymmetric, Has 2x2 block   | 3               | 3               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric with a 2x2 block.                     |\n| 3       | `[[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]]`   | 5 (gray)      | 4-way Symmetric ('+' shape) | 6               | 6               | Yes      | Correctly identified based on symmetry (implicitly, the '+' shape).      |\n| 4       | `[[8,0,8],[0,8,0],[8,0,8]]`   | 8 (azure)     | 4-way Symmetric ('X' shape) | 2               | 6               | No       | Incorrectly classified. Has 4-way symmetry but is an 'X' shape, not '+'. |\n| 5       | `[[5,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,5]]`   | 5 (gray)      | 4-way Symmetric ('X' shape) | 2               | 6               | No       | Incorrectly classified. Has 4-way symmetry but is an 'X' shape, not '+'. |\n| 6       | `[[4,4,0],[4,0,4],[0,4,0]]`   | 4 (yellow)    | Asymmetric, No 2x2 block    | 1               | 1               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric without a 2x2 block.                  |\n| 7       | `[[5,5,0],[5,0,5],[0,5,0]]`   | 5 (gray)      | Asymmetric, No 2x2 block    | 1               | 1               | Yes      | Correctly identified as asymmetric without a 2x2 block.                  |\n\nThe analysis confirms that the distinction between the '+' shape (output 6) and the 'X' shape (output 2) is crucial. Both possess 4-way rotational symmetry, but lead to different outputs. The rules for asymmetric patterns (output 1 or 3 based on 2x2 block presence) remain consistent.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
