"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a single integer based on the rotational symmetry and structure of the non-white pattern.

1. Identify the pattern formed by the non-white pixels in the input 3x3 grid.
2. Determine the rotational symmetry of this pattern.
3. If the pattern has 4-way rotational symmetry (looks the same after 90, 180, 270 degree rotations), the output is 6.
4. Else, if the pattern has 2-way rotational symmetry (looks the same after a 180 degree rotation, but not 90/270), the output is 2.
5. Else (the pattern is asymmetric), check if there exists any 2x2 subgrid within the input grid that consists entirely of the non-white pattern pixels.
6. If such a 2x2 subgrid exists, the output is 3.
7. Otherwise (asymmetric and no 2x2 subgrid of the pattern color), the output is 1.
