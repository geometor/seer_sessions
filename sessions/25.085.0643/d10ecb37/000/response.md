Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example takes a larger grid as input and produces a smaller 2x2 grid as output.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used in the output grid are always present in the corresponding input grid. No new colors are introduced.
3.  **Spatial Relationship:** The output grid seems to correspond to a specific region within the input grid.
4.  **Example 1:** The input is 8x8. The output `[[2, 4], [2, 5]]` matches the subgrid at the top-left corner of the input: `input[0:2, 0:2]`.
5.  **Example 2:** The input is 6x6. The output `[[4, 3], [6, 0]]` matches the subgrid at the top-left corner of the input: `input[0:2, 0:2]`.
6.  **Example 3:** The input is 12x6. The output `[[3, 2], [1, 4]]` matches the subgrid at the top-left corner of the input: `input[0:2, 0:2]`.
7.  **Consistency:** In all provided examples, the output grid is identical to the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: variable height and width (>= 2x2)
  - item: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
      - dimensions: fixed 2x2
transformation:
  - action: extract_subgrid
    source: input_grid
    parameters:
      - top_row: 0
      - left_column: 0
      - height: 2
      - width: 2
    result: output_grid
relationship:
  - The output_grid is the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner (index [0,0]) of the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Select the subgrid composed of the cells at row indices 0 and 1, and column indices 0 and 1.
3.  Return this 2x2 subgrid as the output grid.
