task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - type: grid
  - size: H x W (variable, e.g., 3x3 in examples)
output_properties:
  - type: grid
  - size: 2H x 2W (e.g., 6x6 in examples)
transformation:
  name: tiling_with_reflections
  components:
    - region: top_left_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: identity (no change)
    - region: top_right_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: horizontal_reflection
    - region: bottom_left_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: vertical_reflection
    - region: bottom_right_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: horizontal_and_vertical_reflection (or 180_degree_rotation)
relationship:
  - output_grid_size is double the input_grid_size in both dimensions.
  - output_grid is constructed by placing transformed versions of the input_grid into its four quadrants.
