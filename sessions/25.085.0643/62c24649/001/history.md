Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception:**
The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a larger output grid. In all provided examples, the input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 6x6, exactly double the height and width. The output grid appears to be composed of four copies of the input grid, arranged in a 2x2 pattern. Each copy seems to be a specific transformation (reflection) of the original input grid.

*   The top-left quadrant of the output grid matches the input grid exactly.
*   The top-right quadrant appears to be a horizontal reflection (flipped left-to-right) of the input grid.
*   The bottom-left quadrant appears to be a vertical reflection (flipped top-to-bottom) of the input grid.
*   The bottom-right quadrant appears to be both a horizontal and vertical reflection of the input grid (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - type: grid
  - size: H x W (variable, e.g., 3x3 in examples)
output_properties:
  - type: grid
  - size: 2H x 2W (e.g., 6x6 in examples)
transformation:
  name: tiling_with_reflections
  components:
    - region: top_left_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: identity (no change)
    - region: top_right_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: horizontal_reflection
    - region: bottom_left_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: vertical_reflection
    - region: bottom_right_quadrant
      source: input_grid
      operation: horizontal_and_vertical_reflection (or 180_degree_rotation)
relationship:
  - output_grid_size is double the input_grid_size in both dimensions.
  - output_grid is constructed by placing transformed versions of the input_grid into its four quadrants.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W.
3.  Copy the original input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
4.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid.
5.  Copy the horizontally flipped grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
6.  Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
7.  Copy the vertically flipped grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
8.  Create a version of the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically.
9.  Copy the doubly flipped grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
10. Return the completed output grid.
