Okay, let's break down this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 7 columns.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 3 columns.
3.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Inputs use Orange (7), White (0), Blue (1), and Gray (5).
    *   Outputs use only White (0) and Green (3).
4.  **Key Feature - Separator:** There is always a vertical column of Blue (1) pixels in the input grid, specifically the 4th column (index 3). This column appears to act as a separator, dividing the input grid into two distinct 4x3 regions: a "left region" (columns 0-2) and a "right region" (columns 4-6). The separator column itself is not directly represented in the output.
5.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to involve comparing the left region and the right region pixel by pixel to determine the content of the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions (4x3) as these left and right regions.
6.  **Rule Derivation:** By examining the pixel values across examples:
    *   A pixel in the output grid is Green (3) if *and only if* the corresponding pixel in the *left region* of the input is White (0) AND the corresponding pixel in the *right region* of the input is also White (0).
    *   In all other cases, the pixel in the output grid is White (0). This includes cases where one corresponding input pixel is White (0) but the other is not, or where neither corresponding input pixel is White (0).

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_dimensions:
    input: Fixed 4x7
    output: Fixed 4x3
  colors:
    input: [Orange (7), White (0), Blue (1), Gray (5)]
    output: [White (0), Green (3)]
  features:
    - name: Separator Column
      description: A single vertical column of Blue (1) pixels always present at input column index 3.
      role: Divides the input into two regions of equal size (4x3).
    - name: Left Region
      description: The portion of the input grid to the left of the separator column (columns 0-2).
      dimensions: 4x3
      colors_present: [Orange (7), White (0)]
    - name: Right Region
      description: The portion of the input grid to the right of the separator column (columns 4-6).
      dimensions: 4x3
      colors_present: [Gray (5), White (0)]
transformation:
  type: Pixel-wise Comparison
  input_elements: Left Region, Right Region
  output_elements: Output Grid
  rule:
    condition: For each coordinate (row, col) within the 4x3 dimensions:
      IF Left Region pixel at (row, col) is White (0) AND Right Region pixel at (row, col) is White (0)
      THEN Output Grid pixel at (row, col) is Green (3)
      ELSE Output Grid pixel at (row, col) is White (0)
  relationship: The output grid represents the locations where both the left and right input regions have a White (0) pixel simultaneously.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the vertical column composed entirely of Blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This is the separator column.
2.  Define the "left region" as the columns of the input grid to the left of the separator column.
3.  Define the "right region" as the columns of the input grid to the right of the separator column.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and the same number of columns as the left (or right) region. Initialize all pixels in the output grid to White (0).
5.  Iterate through each pixel coordinate (row `r`, column `c`) within the dimensions of the left region (which are the same as the output grid dimensions).
6.  For each coordinate (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the left region.
    b.  Check the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the right region.
    c.  If *both* the pixel in the left region and the pixel in the right region are White (0), then set the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to Green (3).
    d.  Otherwise, leave the pixel at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid as White (0).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
