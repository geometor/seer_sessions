This column appears to act as a separator, dividing the input grid into two distinct 4x3 regions: a \"left region\" (columns 0-2) and a \"right region\" (columns 4-6). The separator column itself is not directly represented in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation seems to involve comparing the left region and the right region pixel by pixel to determine the content of the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions (4x3) as these left and right regions.\n6.  **Rule Derivation:** By examining the pixel values across examples:\n    *   A pixel in the output grid is Green (3) if *and only if* the corresponding pixel in the *left region* of the input is White (0) AND the corresponding pixel in the *right region* of the input is also White (0).\n    *   In all other cases, the pixel in the output grid is White (0). This includes cases where one corresponding input pixel is White (0) but the other is not, or where neither corresponding input pixel is White (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
