Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have dimensions 3x7. They feature a prominent vertical line of gray (5) pixels in the 4th column (index 3). The remaining pixels are either blue (1) or white (0).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids have dimensions 3x3. They consist only of red (2) and white (0) pixels.
3.  **Key Feature - Gray Separator:** The gray line in the input appears to function as a separator, dividing the grid into a left section (columns 0-2) and a right section (columns 4-6). Both sections have dimensions 3x3, matching the output grid size.
4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to compare the left and right sections of the input grid position by position. A red (2) pixel is placed in the output grid at a specific coordinate (row, column) if, and only if, *both* the left section *and* the right section of the input grid have a blue (1) pixel at that same relative coordinate. If this condition isn't met (i.e., one or both corresponding pixels in the input sections are not blue), the output pixel at that coordinate is white (0).
5.  **Color Mapping:** Input blue (1) pixels are the key trigger. When the condition (presence in both halves) is met, they result in an output red (2) pixel. All other input configurations result in an output white (0) pixel.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Combine information from two halves of an input grid based on a separator.

Input:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 7
      colors: [white(0), blue(1), gray(5)]
  - name: separator
    type: object
    description: A vertical line of gray(5) pixels.
    location: Column index 3.
    function: Divides the input_grid into two subgrids.
  - name: left_subgrid
    type: grid_section
    derivation: Columns 0-2 of input_grid.
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors: [white(0), blue(1)]
  - name: right_subgrid
    type: grid_section
    derivation: Columns 4-6 of input_grid.
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors: [white(0), blue(1)]

Output:
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      colors: [white(0), red(2)]

Transformation:
  - action: Compare corresponding pixels
    input_1: left_subgrid
    input_2: right_subgrid
    output: output_grid
    rule: For each coordinate (row, col):
            IF left_subgrid[row, col] == blue(1) AND right_subgrid[row, col] == blue(1)
            THEN output_grid[row, col] = red(2)
            ELSE output_grid[row, col] = white(0)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the vertical line of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This line acts as a separator.
2.  Define the 'left subgrid' as the portion of the input grid to the left of the gray separator (columns 0-2).
3.  Define the 'right subgrid' as the portion of the input grid to the right of the gray separator (columns 4-6).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the left (or right) subgrid (3x3), initially filled with white (0) pixels.
5.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) within the dimensions of the subgrids (rows 0-2, columns 0-2).
6.  For the current position (`r`, `c`), check the color of the pixel in the `left_subgrid` at (`r`, `c`) and the color of the pixel in the `right_subgrid` at (`r`, `c`).
7.  If *both* pixels checked in step 6 are blue (1), set the pixel in the `output_grid` at position (`r`, `c`) to red (2).
8.  If the condition in step 7 is not met (i.e., at least one of the corresponding pixels is not blue), leave the pixel in the `output_grid` at position (`r`, `c`) as white (0).
9.  Return the completed `output_grid`.
