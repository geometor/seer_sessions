            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have dimensions 3x7. They feature a prominent vertical line of gray (5) pixels in the 4th column (index 3). The remaining pixels are either blue (1) or white (0).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids have dimensions 3x3. They consist only of red (2) and white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Key Feature - Gray Separator:** The gray line in the input appears to function as a separator, dividing the grid into a left section (columns 0-2) and a right section (columns 4-6). Both sections have dimensions 3x3, matching the output grid size.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation seems to compare the left and right sections of the input grid position by position. A red (2) pixel is placed in the output grid at a specific coordinate (row, column) if, and only if, *both* the left section *and* the right section of the input grid have a blue (1) pixel at that same relative coordinate. If this condition isn't met (i.e., one or both corresponding pixels in the input sections are not blue), the output pixel at that coordinate is white (0).\n5.  **Color Mapping:** Input blue (1) pixels are the key trigger. When the condition (presence in both halves) is met, they result in an output red (2) pixel. All other input configurations result in an output white (0) pixel.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
