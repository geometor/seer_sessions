The colors present in the input grid are the same as the colors present in the output grid, but their positions have changed. Comparing the input and output grids in each example, it appears that the output grid is a transformation of the input grid where rows have become columns and columns have become rows. This is consistent across all provided examples and is characteristic of a matrix transpose operation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
