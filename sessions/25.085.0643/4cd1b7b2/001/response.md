Processes a 4x4 grid based on the following rules:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Define the set of possible fill colors: U = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (row r, column c).
4. If the value of the input cell input[r, c] is white (0):
    a. Create an empty set C to store context colors.
    b. Scan row r: For each cell in this row, if its color is not white (0), add it to set C.
    c. Scan column c: For each cell in this column, if its color is not white (0), add it to set C.
    d. Calculate the set of missing colors M by finding the difference between the universal set U and the context set C (M = U - C).
    e. Check the size of set M:
        i. If M contains exactly one color, set the output cell output[r, c] to that color.
        ii. If M contains more than one color:
            1. Find the minimum color value in M, call it min_M.
            2. Check if min_M is 1 AND if the set M is exactly equal to {1, 2}.
            3. If both conditions in step (ii.2) are true, set the output cell output[r, c] to 2.
            4. Otherwise (if min_M is not 1, or M is not {1, 2}), set the output cell output[r, c] to min_M.
5. If the value of the input cell input[r, c] is not white (0), its value in the output grid output[r, c] remains unchanged.
6. After iterating through all cells, return the output grid.
