            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 4x4 grids. The dimensions remain unchanged.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use colors white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation seems to involve only the white (0) cells in the input grid. All non-white cells (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input appear to retain their original positions and colors in the output grid.\n4.  **White Cell Replacement:** Each white cell in the input is replaced by a non-white color (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the output.\n5.  **Contextual Coloring:** The specific color used to replace a white cell appears to depend on the non-white colors present in the *same row and column* as that white cell in the input grid.\n6.  **Rule Identification:** The rule seems to involve identifying which colors from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} are *missing* from the combined set of non-white colors found in the white cell's row and column.\n7.  **Tie-Breaking:** When more than one color is missing from the row/column context, a specific tie-breaking rule is needed. The examples suggest this rule involves selecting the minimum missing color, with a special case adjustment if the missing colors are exactly {1, 2}.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`).\n4.  If the value of the input cell `input[r, c]` is white (0):\n    a.  Create an empty set `C` to store context colors.\n    b.  Scan row `r`: For each cell in this row, if its color is not white (0), add it to set `C`.\n    c.  Scan column `c`: For each cell in this column, if its color is not white (0), add it to set `C`.\n    d.  Calculate the set of missing colors `M` by finding the difference between the universal set `U` and the context set `C` (`M = U - C`).\n    e.  Check the size of set `M`:\n        i.  If `M` contains exactly one color, set the output cell `output[r, c]` to that color.\n        ii. If `M` contains more than one color:\n            1. Find the minimum color value in `M`, call it `min_M`.\n            2. Check if `min_M` is 1 AND if the set `M` is exactly equal to `{1, 2}`.\n            3. If both conditions in step (ii.2) are true, set the output cell `output[r, c]` to 2.\n            4. Otherwise (if `min_M` is not 1, or `M` is not `{1, 2}`), set the output cell `output[r, c]` to `min_M`.\n5.  If the value of the input cell `input[r, c]` is *not* white (0), its value in the output grid `output[r, c]` remains unchanged (already copied in step 1).\n6.  After iterating through all cells, the `output` grid contains the final transformed result."
