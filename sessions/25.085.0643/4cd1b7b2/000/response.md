Okay, let's break down the transformation.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both 4x4 grids. The dimensions remain unchanged.
2.  **Color Palette:** The grids use colors white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation seems to involve only the white (0) cells in the input grid. All non-white cells (1, 2, 3, 4) in the input appear to retain their original positions and colors in the output grid.
4.  **White Cell Replacement:** Each white cell in the input is replaced by a non-white color (1, 2, 3, or 4) in the output.
5.  **Contextual Coloring:** The specific color used to replace a white cell appears to depend on the non-white colors present in the *same row and column* as that white cell in the input grid.
6.  **Rule Identification:** The rule seems to involve identifying which colors from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} are *missing* from the combined set of non-white colors found in the white cell's row and column.
7.  **Tie-Breaking:** When more than one color is missing from the row/column context, a specific tie-breaking rule is needed. The examples suggest this rule involves selecting the minimum missing color, with a special case adjustment if the missing colors are exactly {1, 2}.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: fill_empty_cells
grid_properties:
  size: fixed (4x4 in examples)
  color_palette: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] # white, blue, red, green, yellow
cell_focus: white_cells (value 0)
transformation_rule:
  action: replace_white_cells
  reference_set: [1, 2, 3, 4] # Potential fill colors
  context:
    - row_colors: non-white colors in the same row as the white cell
    - column_colors: non-white colors in the same column as the white cell
  logic:
    1. Combine row_colors and column_colors into a set `C`.
    2. Find missing colors `M = reference_set - C`.
    3. If `M` contains one color, use that color.
    4. If `M` contains multiple colors:
       - Determine `min_M = minimum value in M`.
       - If `min_M == 1` and `M == {1, 2}`, use color `2`.
       - Otherwise, use color `min_M`.
unchanged_elements: non-white_cells (retain position and color)
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Define the set of possible fill colors: `U = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`).
4.  If the value of the input cell `input[r, c]` is white (0):
    a.  Create an empty set `C` to store context colors.
    b.  Scan row `r`: For each cell in this row, if its color is not white (0), add it to set `C`.
    c.  Scan column `c`: For each cell in this column, if its color is not white (0), add it to set `C`.
    d.  Calculate the set of missing colors `M` by finding the difference between the universal set `U` and the context set `C` (`M = U - C`).
    e.  Check the size of set `M`:
        i.  If `M` contains exactly one color, set the output cell `output[r, c]` to that color.
        ii. If `M` contains more than one color:
            1. Find the minimum color value in `M`, call it `min_M`.
            2. Check if `min_M` is 1 AND if the set `M` is exactly equal to `{1, 2}`.
            3. If both conditions in step (ii.2) are true, set the output cell `output[r, c]` to 2.
            4. Otherwise (if `min_M` is not 1, or `M` is not `{1, 2}`), set the output cell `output[r, c]` to `min_M`.
5.  If the value of the input cell `input[r, c]` is *not* white (0), its value in the output grid `output[r, c]` remains unchanged (already copied in step 1).
6.  After iterating through all cells, the `output` grid contains the final transformed result.
