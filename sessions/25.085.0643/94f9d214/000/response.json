Visually, they appear to be composed of two distinct 4x4 sections stacked vertically.\n2.  **Input Color Patterns**:\n    *   The top 4x4 section (rows 0-3) primarily uses green (3) pixels on a white (0) background to form a pattern.\n    *   The bottom 4x4 section (rows 4-7) primarily uses blue (1) pixels on a white (0) background to form a different pattern.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure**: Each output grid is 4 rows by 4 columns, matching the dimensions of the input sections.\n4.  **Output Color Patterns**: The output grids contain only red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.\n5.  **Transformation Logic**: The output seems to be derived by comparing the top 4x4 section of the input with the bottom 4x4 section. Specifically, a red (2) pixel appears in the output grid at a position (r, c) only where *both* the top input section *and* the bottom input section have a white (0) pixel at that same relative position (r, c). If either or both corresponding input pixels are non-white (green or blue), the output pixel at (r, c) is white (0).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

If the pixel in the 'top grid' at (r, c) is white (0) AND the pixel in the 'bottom grid' at (r, c) is also white (0), then change the color of the pixel in the output grid at (r, c) to red (2).\n6.  If the condition in step 5 is not met (i.e., if either or both corresponding input pixels are not white), leave the output grid pixel at (r, c) as white (0).\n7.  After iterating through all positions, the resulting 4x4 grid is the final output."
