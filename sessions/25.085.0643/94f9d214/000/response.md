Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure**: Each input grid is 8 rows by 4 columns. Visually, they appear to be composed of two distinct 4x4 sections stacked vertically.
2.  **Input Color Patterns**:
    *   The top 4x4 section (rows 0-3) primarily uses green (3) pixels on a white (0) background to form a pattern.
    *   The bottom 4x4 section (rows 4-7) primarily uses blue (1) pixels on a white (0) background to form a different pattern.
3.  **Output Grid Structure**: Each output grid is 4 rows by 4 columns, matching the dimensions of the input sections.
4.  **Output Color Patterns**: The output grids contain only red (2) pixels on a white (0) background.
5.  **Transformation Logic**: The output seems to be derived by comparing the top 4x4 section of the input with the bottom 4x4 section. Specifically, a red (2) pixel appears in the output grid at a position (r, c) only where *both* the top input section *and* the bottom input section have a white (0) pixel at that same relative position (r, c). If either or both corresponding input pixels are non-white (green or blue), the output pixel at (r, c) is white (0).

## Facts


```yaml
- task: Identify corresponding white pixels in two vertically stacked patterns.
- grid_dimensions:
    - input: 8x4
    - output: 4x4
- color_roles:
    - white (0): Background color in both input sections and the output grid. Crucial for the comparison logic.
    - green (3): Forms the pattern in the top 4x4 section of the input.
    - blue (1): Forms the pattern in the bottom 4x4 section of the input.
    - red (2): Marks the positions in the output grid where the comparison condition is met.
- structure:
    - input_division: The 8x4 input grid is treated as two separate 4x4 grids.
        - top_section: Input rows 0 through 3.
        - bottom_section: Input rows 4 through 7.
    - output_correspondence: The output grid has the same dimensions (4x4) as the input sections.
- transformation:
    - type: Pixel-wise comparison between input sections.
    - rule: For each coordinate (row `r`, column `c`) within the 4x4 dimensions:
        - Condition: Check if the pixel at `input[r][c]` is white (0) AND the pixel at `input[r+4][c]` is white (0).
        - Output mapping:
            - If Condition is TRUE: The output pixel at `output[r][c]` is red (2).
            - If Condition is FALSE: The output pixel at `output[r][c]` is white (0).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Divide the 8x4 input grid into two 4x4 grids: the 'top grid' (rows 0-3) and the 'bottom grid' (rows 4-7).
2.  Create a new 4x4 output grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
3.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
4.  For the current position (r, c), examine the color of the pixel in the 'top grid' at `top_grid[r][c]` and the color of the pixel in the 'bottom grid' at `bottom_grid[r][c]`.
5.  If the pixel in the 'top grid' at (r, c) is white (0) AND the pixel in the 'bottom grid' at (r, c) is also white (0), then change the color of the pixel in the output grid at (r, c) to red (2).
6.  If the condition in step 5 is not met (i.e., if either or both corresponding input pixels are not white), leave the output grid pixel at (r, c) as white (0).
7.  After iterating through all positions, the resulting 4x4 grid is the final output.
