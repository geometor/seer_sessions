- task: Identify corresponding white pixels in two vertically stacked patterns.
- grid_dimensions:
    - input: 8x4
    - output: 4x4
- color_roles:
    - white (0): Background color in both input sections and the output grid. Crucial for the comparison logic.
    - green (3): Forms the pattern in the top 4x4 section of the input.
    - blue (1): Forms the pattern in the bottom 4x4 section of the input.
    - red (2): Marks the positions in the output grid where the comparison condition is met.
- structure:
    - input_division: The 8x4 input grid is treated as two separate 4x4 grids.
        - top_section: Input rows 0 through 3.
        - bottom_section: Input rows 4 through 7.
    - output_correspondence: The output grid has the same dimensions (4x4) as the input sections.
- transformation:
    - type: Pixel-wise comparison between input sections.
    - rule: For each coordinate (row `r`, column `c`) within the 4x4 dimensions:
        - Condition: Check if the pixel at `input[r][c]` is white (0) AND the pixel at `input[r+4][c]` is white (0).
        - Output mapping:
            - If Condition is TRUE: The output pixel at `output[r][c]` is red (2).
            - If Condition is FALSE: The output pixel at `output[r][c]` is white (0).
