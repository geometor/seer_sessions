task_context:
  description: Rearrange pixels within a single-column grid based on specific index swaps.
  grid_properties:
    - type: single column (width 1)
    - height: variable (observed height 5 in examples)
    - pixels: represented by integers 0-9 (colors)
input_objects:
  - object: pixel_list
    description: A vertical list of pixels in the input column.
output_objects:
  - object: pixel_list
    description: A vertical list of pixels, rearranged from the input.
transformation:
  actions:
    - action: identify_indices
      description: Determine the indices of pixels in the column (0 to height-1).
    - action: swap_pixels
      description: Swap pixels at specific index pairs.
      conditions:
        - if height >= 2: swap index 0 and index 1.
        - if height >= 5: swap index 3 and index 4.
      notes: Pixel at index 2 remains unchanged if height >= 3. The behavior for heights other than 5 needs further clarification if encountered.
