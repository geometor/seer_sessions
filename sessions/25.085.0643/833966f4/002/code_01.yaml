task_context:
  description: Rearranges pixels within a single-column grid based on fixed index swaps.
  grid_properties:
    - type: single column (width 1)
    - height: 5 (based on examples, generalization needed for other heights)
    - pixels: integers 0-9 (colors)
input_objects:
  - object: input_column
    description: A vertical list of pixels (height 5).
    attributes:
      - pixels: list of colors at indices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
output_objects:
  - object: output_column
    description: The rearranged vertical list of pixels (height 5).
    attributes:
      - pixels: list of colors derived from input pixels.
transformation:
  description: Swaps specific pairs of pixels based on their indices in the column.
  actions:
    - action: swap_indices_0_1
      input: pixels at index 0 and 1
      output: pixel from index 0 moved to index 1, pixel from index 1 moved to index 0.
    - action: keep_index_2
      input: pixel at index 2
      output: pixel remains at index 2.
    - action: swap_indices_3_4
      input: pixels at index 3 and 4
      output: pixel from index 3 moved to index 4, pixel from index 4 moved to index 3.
  assumptions:
    - This specific swap pattern (0<>1, 2<>2, 3<>4) applies to grids of height 5. The behavior for other heights is currently undefined by the examples.
