Maroon (9) appears most frequently (3 times). The output is filled with maroon (9).\n    *   Example 2: Input has yellow (3), grey (1), magenta (2), green (2), white (1). Yellow (4) appears most frequently (3 times). The output is filled with yellow (4).\n    *   Example 3: Input has yellow (2), magenta (3), maroon (1), blue (1), grey (2). Magenta (6) appears most frequently (3 times). The output is filled with magenta (6).\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying the most frequent color (pixel value) in the input grid and then creating an output grid of the same size, filled entirely with that most frequent color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
