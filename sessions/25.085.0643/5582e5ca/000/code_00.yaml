task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - input_output_size_conservation: True  # Output grid dimensions match input grid dimensions.
  - output_homogeneity: True             # Output grid contains only one color.
elements:
  - role: input_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels with varying colors.
  - role: output_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels filled with a single color derived from the input.
transformation:
  - type: analysis
    scope: whole_grid
    input: input_grid
    operation: frequency_count
    description: Count the occurrences of each distinct pixel color within the input grid.
  - type: selection
    criteria: most_frequent
    input: color_frequencies
    output: selected_color
    description: Identify the color with the highest frequency count. (Assumes no ties or defines a tie-breaker based on observed data - none seen yet).
  - type: construction
    input: [input_grid_dimensions, selected_color]
    output: output_grid
    operation: fill
    description: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling all pixels with the selected_color.
relationships:
  - output_grid color is determined by the most frequent color in the input_grid.
  - output_grid dimensions are identical to input_grid dimensions.
assumptions:
  - There is always a unique most frequent color in the input grid. (Based on provided examples).
