task_description: Applies a two-stage compression to the input grid. First, compresses each row horizontally by removing consecutive duplicate pixel colors, keeping only the first pixel of each contiguous block. Second, compresses the resulting grid vertically by removing consecutive identical rows, keeping only the first row of each contiguous block of identical rows.

grid_properties:
  - Input and output grids are 2D arrangements of pixels.
  - Pixel values are integers representing colors.
  - Grid dimensions change during the transformation.

objects:
  - pixel: A cell with a specific color value.
  - row: A horizontal sequence of pixels.
  - contiguous_horizontal_block: A sequence of one or more adjacent pixels in the same row having the same color.
  - processed_row: A row resulting from horizontal compression, containing only the first pixel of each contiguous_horizontal_block from the original row.
  - contiguous_vertical_block: A sequence of one or more adjacent, identical processed_rows.

actions:
  - horizontal_compression (applied per row):
      input: row
      output: processed_row
      rule: Iterate through the input row. Retain the first pixel. For subsequent pixels, retain a pixel only if its color differs from the immediately preceding pixel's color in the input row.
  - vertical_compression (applied to list of processed rows):
      input: list_of_processed_rows
      output: final_list_of_rows
      rule: Iterate through the list of processed rows. Retain the first processed row. For subsequent processed rows, retain a row only if it is different from the immediately preceding row in the list.

inferred_goal: To generate a compressed representation of the input grid by eliminating horizontal and vertical redundancy according to specific run-length encoding rules (keep first element of each run).
