```python

"""
Processes an input grid in two steps:
1.  For each row, remove adjacent duplicate colors horizontally. Only the first pixel in a contiguous horizontal block of the same color is kept.
2.  From the resulting list of processed rows, remove consecutive identical rows vertically. Only the first row in a contiguous vertical block of identical processed rows is kept.
The final list of rows forms the output grid.
