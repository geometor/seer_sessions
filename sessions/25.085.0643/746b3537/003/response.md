Applies a two-stage compression to the input grid. 
First, compresses each row horizontally by removing consecutive duplicate pixel colors, 
keeping only the first pixel of each contiguous block. 
Second, compresses the resulting grid vertically by removing consecutive identical rows, 
keeping only the first row of each contiguous block of identical rows.
