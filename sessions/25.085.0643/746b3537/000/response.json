            "text": "*   **Perception**:\n    *   The input grids contain rows where colors may repeat horizontally and rows themselves may be identical to adjacent rows.\n    *   The output grids are generally smaller than the input grids, both in height and often in width.\n    *   The transformation seems to involve processing rows individually and then processing the sequence of processed rows.\n    *   In Example 1, `(2, 2)` becomes `(2)`, `(6, 6)` becomes `(6)`, `(8, 8)` becomes `(8)`. The final output `(2), (6), (8)` suggests that identical consecutive results (`(8)`) are also reduced.\n    *   In Example 2, identical input rows `(3, 4, 6)` result in a single output row `(3, 4, 6)`.\n    *   In Example 3, the row `(2, 3, 3, 8, 1)` becomes `(2, 3, 8, 1)`, indicating adjacent duplicates within a row are removed. Since all input rows are identical, the output is just one instance of the processed row.\n    *   In Example 4, rows like `(4, 4, 4, 4)` become `(4)`. Then, the sequence of processed rows `(4), (4), (2), (2), (8), (3)` is reduced to `(4), (2), (8), (3)` by removing consecutive identical rows.\n    *   In Example 5, rows `(1, 1, 1)` become `(1)` and `(2, 2, 2)` becomes `(2)`. The sequence of processed rows is `(1), (2), (1)`. Since there are no consecutive identical rows, the output matches this sequence.\n    *   The process appears to be: 1. Simplify each row by removing adjacent duplicate colors. 2. Simplify the resulting list of rows by removing consecutive identical rows.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
