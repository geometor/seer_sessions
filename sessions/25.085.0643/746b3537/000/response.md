*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grids contain rows where colors may repeat horizontally and rows themselves may be identical to adjacent rows.
    *   The output grids are generally smaller than the input grids, both in height and often in width.
    *   The transformation seems to involve processing rows individually and then processing the sequence of processed rows.
    *   In Example 1, `(2, 2)` becomes `(2)`, `(6, 6)` becomes `(6)`, `(8, 8)` becomes `(8)`. The final output `(2), (6), (8)` suggests that identical consecutive results (`(8)`) are also reduced.
    *   In Example 2, identical input rows `(3, 4, 6)` result in a single output row `(3, 4, 6)`.
    *   In Example 3, the row `(2, 3, 3, 8, 1)` becomes `(2, 3, 8, 1)`, indicating adjacent duplicates within a row are removed. Since all input rows are identical, the output is just one instance of the processed row.
    *   In Example 4, rows like `(4, 4, 4, 4)` become `(4)`. Then, the sequence of processed rows `(4), (4), (2), (2), (8), (3)` is reduced to `(4), (2), (8), (3)` by removing consecutive identical rows.
    *   In Example 5, rows `(1, 1, 1)` become `(1)` and `(2, 2, 2)` becomes `(2)`. The sequence of processed rows is `(1), (2), (1)`. Since there are no consecutive identical rows, the output matches this sequence.
    *   The process appears to be: 1. Simplify each row by removing adjacent duplicate colors. 2. Simplify the resulting list of rows by removing consecutive identical rows.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an empty list called `processed_rows`.
    2.  For each `row` in the `input_grid`:
        a.  Initialize an empty list called `current_processed_row`.
        b.  Iterate through the `pixels` in the `row`.
        c.  If `current_processed_row` is empty or the current `pixel` is different from the last pixel added to `current_processed_row`, append the current `pixel` to `current_processed_row`.
        d.  Append the `current_processed_row` to the `processed_rows` list.
    3.  Initialize an empty list called `final_rows`.
    4.  Iterate through the `rows` in the `processed_rows` list.
    5.  If `final_rows` is empty or the current `row` is different from the last row added to `final_rows`, append the current `row` to `final_rows`.
    6.  Construct the `output_grid` using the rows in the `final_rows` list.
