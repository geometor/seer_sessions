Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

### Perception

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The grid dimensions vary across examples.
2.  **Color Palette:** The specific colors present in the input grid vary between examples.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing certain pixels in the input grid to a specific color, orange (7), in the output grid. Other pixels retain their original color.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** The change to orange (7) appears conditional. It depends on both the original color of the pixel itself and the colors of its immediate neighbors (including diagonals).
5.  **Stable Colors:** For each example pair, there seems to be a subset of colors present in the input that *never* change to orange (7) in the output. These "stable" colors seem to play a crucial role. If a pixel's color is one of these stable colors, it remains unchanged.
6.  **Triggering Change:** Pixels whose colors are *not* stable potentially change to orange (7). The trigger for this change is the presence of at least one neighbor (orthogonal or diagonal) whose color *is* one of the stable colors.
7.  **Identifying Stable Colors:** The set of stable colors for a given input-output pair can be identified by finding the colors that exist in the input grid and also exist in the output grid *at the same position*, excluding any instances where the output color is orange (7). A simpler way seems to be: find all unique colors in the input, find all unique colors in the output *except* orange (7), and the intersection of these two sets gives the stable colors.

### Facts

task_elements:
  - description: Input and output are grids of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - grid_properties:
      - dimensions: Variable height and width (1x1 to 30x30).
      - values: Integers 0-9.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Conditional Color Replacement
  - target_color: 7 (orange)
  - conditions:
      - Applies to each pixel individually.
      - Depends on the pixel's original color and its neighbors' colors.
  - key_concept:
      - name: Stable Colors
      - definition: A subset of colors present in the input grid that do not change to orange (7) in the output grid. These colors are determined per task instance.
      - identification: Find unique colors in input. Find unique colors in output, excluding orange (7). The intersection is the set of stable colors.
  - steps:
      - step_1: Determine the set of "stable colors" for the given input/output pair.
      - step_2: Iterate through each pixel (cell) in the input grid.
      - step_3: Let 'C' be the color of the current pixel.
      - step_4: Check if 'C' belongs to the set of stable colors.
      - step_5: If 'C' IS NOT a stable color:
          - Check all 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) of the current pixel.
          - If at least one neighbor's color IS a stable color:
              - Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to orange (7).
          - Else (no stable neighbors):
              - Keep the original color 'C' in the output grid.
      - step_6: If 'C' IS a stable color:
          - Keep the original color 'C' in the output grid.
  - neighborhood:
      - type: Moore neighborhood (8 surrounding cells, including diagonals).
      - boundary_handling: Neighbors outside the grid boundaries are ignored.

### Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Stable Colors:** Given an input grid and its corresponding output grid, determine the set of "stable colors". These are the colors present in the input grid which also appear in the output grid *without* having been changed to orange (7). Calculate this by finding the intersection of the unique colors in the input grid and the unique colors in the output grid (excluding orange (7)).
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially copying all pixel values from the input grid.
3.  **Process Each Pixel:** For each pixel at position (row, column) in the input grid:
    a.  Get the color `C` of the input pixel `input[row, column]`.
    b.  Check if color `C` is present in the previously identified set of stable colors.
    c.  **If `C` is NOT a stable color:**
        i.  Examine the colors of all valid neighbors of this pixel (up to 8 neighbors: top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, bottom, bottom-right).
        ii. If any of these neighbors has a color that IS in the set of stable colors:
            Change the color of the pixel at `output[row, column]` to orange (7).
        iii. (If `C` is not stable, but none of its neighbors are stable, the output pixel retains its original color `C` as per the initialization in Step 2).
    d.  **If `C` IS a stable color:**
        i. The pixel at `output[row, column]` retains its original color `C` (as initialized in Step 2).
4.  **Return Output Grid:** The final modified grid is the result of the transformation.
