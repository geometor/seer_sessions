task_elements:
  - description: Input and output are grids of pixels with integer values 0-9 representing colors.
  - grid_properties:
      - dimensions: Variable height and width (1x1 to 30x30).
      - values: Integers 0-9.
transformation_rule:
  - name: Conditional Color Replacement
  - target_color: 7 (orange)
  - conditions:
      - Applies to each pixel individually.
      - Depends on the pixel's original color and its neighbors' colors.
  - key_concept:
      - name: Stable Colors
      - definition: A subset of colors present in the input grid that do not change to orange (7) in the output grid. These colors are determined per task instance.
      - identification: Find unique colors in input. Find unique colors in output, excluding orange (7). The intersection is the set of stable colors.
  - steps:
      - step_1: Determine the set of "stable colors" for the given input/output pair.
      - step_2: Iterate through each pixel (cell) in the input grid.
      - step_3: Let 'C' be the color of the current pixel.
      - step_4: Check if 'C' belongs to the set of stable colors.
      - step_5: If 'C' IS NOT a stable color:
          - Check all 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) of the current pixel.
          - If at least one neighbor's color IS a stable color:
              - Set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to orange (7).
          - Else (no stable neighbors):
              - Keep the original color 'C' in the output grid.
      - step_6: If 'C' IS a stable color:
          - Keep the original color 'C' in the output grid.
  - neighborhood:
      - type: Moore neighborhood (8 surrounding cells, including diagonals).
      - boundary_handling: Neighbors outside the grid boundaries are ignored.
