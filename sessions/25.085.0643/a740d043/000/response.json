Embedded within this background are one or more small, contiguous objects of different colors (green, red, gray, magenta). The task seems to involve isolating these objects from the background and creating a new, smaller grid that contains only these objects, preserving their relative spatial arrangement. The background of the output grid is white (value 0), replacing the original blue background and any empty space within the bounding box of the extracted objects.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
