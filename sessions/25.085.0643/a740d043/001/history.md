*   **Perception**: The input grids consist primarily of a background color (blue, value 1). Embedded within this background are one or more small, contiguous objects of different colors (green, red, gray, magenta). The task seems to involve isolating these objects from the background and creating a new, smaller grid that contains only these objects, preserving their relative spatial arrangement. The background of the output grid is white (value 0), replacing the original blue background and any empty space within the bounding box of the extracted objects.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_description: Extract non-background objects and place them on a new canvas, preserving relative positions.
    background_color: 1 # blue
    output_fill_color: 0 # white
    elements:
      - role: background
        color: 1
        description: The dominant color in the input grid, which is ignored during processing.
      - role: objects
        description: Contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than the background color (1).
        properties:
          - color: Any color except 1.
          - shape: Varies (e.g., 2x1, 2x2, 1x1, 1x2).
          - position: Their location within the input grid.
    actions:
      - action: identify_objects
        description: Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (1).
      - action: determine_bounding_box
        description: Find the smallest rectangle (defined by min/max row and column indices) that encloses all identified non-background pixels.
      - action: create_output_grid
        description: Initialize a new grid with dimensions equal to the height and width of the bounding box, filled with the output fill color (0).
      - action: transfer_objects
        description: Copy the non-background pixels from the input grid into the output grid. The position of each pixel in the output grid is determined by its original position relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box in the input grid.
    relationships:
      - type: spatial_preservation
        description: The relative positions of the non-background objects to each other are maintained in the output grid.
      - type: replacement
        description: The original background color (1) is removed, and any space within the bounding box in the output grid not occupied by an object pixel is filled with the output fill color (0).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not blue (color 1).
    2.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row`), maximum row index (`max_row`), minimum column index (`min_col`), and maximum column index (`max_col`) among all the non-blue pixels found in step 1. This defines the bounding box containing the objects.
    3.  Calculate the height of the bounding box as `height = max_row - min_row + 1`.
    4.  Calculate the width of the bounding box as `width = max_col - min_col + 1`.
    5.  Create a new output grid with the calculated `height` and `width`, initially filled entirely with white pixels (color 0).
    6.  Iterate through each pixel within the bounding box in the input grid (from `min_row` to `max_row` and `min_col` to `max_col`).
    7.  If an input pixel at `(row, col)` is not blue (color 1), copy its color to the output grid at position `(row - min_row, col - min_col)`.
    8.  Return the generated output grid.
