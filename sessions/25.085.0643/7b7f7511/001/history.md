Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid.
2.  **Dimensions:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid in one dimension (either width or height), while the other dimension remains the same.
    *   train_1: Input 6x3 -> Output 3x3 (width halved)
    *   train_2: Input 8x4 -> Output 4x4 (width halved)
    *   train_3: Input 2x6 -> Output 2x3 (height halved)
3.  **Content Relationship:** The output grid seems to be a subgrid of the input grid. Specifically, it looks like one half of the input grid.
4.  **Pattern Repetition:** On closer inspection, the input grids appear to be composed of a smaller pattern repeated exactly twice.
    *   train_1: The left half `[[4, 4, 4], [6, 4, 8], [6, 6, 8]]` is identical to the right half. The repetition is horizontal.
    *   train_2: The left half `[[1, 1, 3, 2], [1, 1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1, 1], [2, 3, 1, 1]]` is identical to the right half. The repetition is horizontal.
    *   train_3: The top half `[[2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 4]]` is identical to the bottom half. The repetition is vertical.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation identifies this repeated pattern and outputs only a single instance of it. If the repetition is horizontal, the left half is kept. If the repetition is vertical, the top half is kept.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Identify a repeating pattern within the input grid and extract a single instance.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - content: 2D array of pixels
      - structure: Contains a smaller pattern repeated exactly twice, either horizontally or vertically.

  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: H or H/2
      - width: W/2 or W
      - content: 2D array of pixels
      - relationship_to_input: A single instance of the repeating pattern found in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: check_horizontal_repetition
    condition: Input grid width W is even.
    steps:
      - Split the input grid vertically into a left_half (columns 0 to W/2 - 1) and a right_half (columns W/2 to W - 1).
      - Compare left_half and right_half pixel by pixel.
    result: Boolean (True if identical, False otherwise).

  - action: check_vertical_repetition
    condition: Input grid height H is even.
    steps:
      - Split the input grid horizontally into a top_half (rows 0 to H/2 - 1) and a bottom_half (rows H/2 to H - 1).
      - Compare top_half and bottom_half pixel by pixel.
    result: Boolean (True if identical, False otherwise).

  - action: determine_output
    conditions_and_results:
      - condition: Horizontal repetition is True.
        result: Output grid is the left_half of the input grid.
      - condition: Vertical repetition is True.
        result: Output grid is the top_half of the input grid.

assumptions:
  - The input grid always contains exactly one type of repetition (either horizontal or vertical) where the pattern is repeated precisely twice.
  - If horizontal repetition occurs, the width is even.
  - If vertical repetition occurs, the height is even.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid's dimensions (height H, width W).
2.  Check for horizontal repetition:
    *   If the width W is even, divide the grid vertically into two equal halves: a left half (columns 0 to W/2 - 1) and a right half (columns W/2 to W - 1).
    *   Compare the left half and the right half.
    *   If the left half is identical to the right half, the output grid is the left half.
3.  If horizontal repetition was not found (or width was odd), check for vertical repetition:
    *   If the height H is even, divide the grid horizontally into two equal halves: a top half (rows 0 to H/2 - 1) and a bottom half (rows H/2 to H - 1).
    *   Compare the top half and the bottom half.
    *   If the top half is identical to the bottom half, the output grid is the top half.
