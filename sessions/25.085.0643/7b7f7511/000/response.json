Specifically, it looks like one half of the input grid.\n4.  **Pattern Repetition:** On closer inspection, the input grids appear to be composed of a smaller pattern repeated exactly twice.\n    *   train_1: The left half `[[4, 4, 4], [6, 4, 8], [6, 6, 8]]` is identical to the right half. The repetition is horizontal.\n    *   train_2: The left half `[[1, 1, 3, 2], [1, 1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1, 1], [2, 3, 1, 1]]` is identical to the right half. The repetition is horizontal.\n    *   train_3: The top half `[[2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 4]]` is identical to the bottom half. The repetition is vertical.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation identifies this repeated pattern and outputs only a single instance of it. If the repetition is horizontal, the left half is kept. If the repetition is vertical, the top half is kept.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
