task_description: Identify a repeating pattern within the input grid and extract a single instance.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
      - content: 2D array of pixels
      - structure: Contains a smaller pattern repeated exactly twice, either horizontally or vertically.

  - element: output_grid
    properties:
      - height: H or H/2
      - width: W/2 or W
      - content: 2D array of pixels
      - relationship_to_input: A single instance of the repeating pattern found in the input grid.

actions:
  - action: check_horizontal_repetition
    condition: Input grid width W is even.
    steps:
      - Split the input grid vertically into a left_half (columns 0 to W/2 - 1) and a right_half (columns W/2 to W - 1).
      - Compare left_half and right_half pixel by pixel.
    result: Boolean (True if identical, False otherwise).

  - action: check_vertical_repetition
    condition: Input grid height H is even.
    steps:
      - Split the input grid horizontally into a top_half (rows 0 to H/2 - 1) and a bottom_half (rows H/2 to H - 1).
      - Compare top_half and bottom_half pixel by pixel.
    result: Boolean (True if identical, False otherwise).

  - action: determine_output
    conditions_and_results:
      - condition: Horizontal repetition is True.
        result: Output grid is the left_half of the input grid.
      - condition: Vertical repetition is True.
        result: Output grid is the top_half of the input grid.

assumptions:
  - The input grid always contains exactly one type of repetition (either horizontal or vertical) where the pattern is repeated precisely twice.
  - If horizontal repetition occurs, the width is even.
  - If vertical repetition occurs, the height is even.
