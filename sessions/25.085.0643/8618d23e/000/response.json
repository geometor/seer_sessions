This row is located at the midpoint of the original grid's height. (e.g., if input height is H, this row is at index H/2 in the output).\n    *   There is a column of maroon added to the right of the top half.\n    *   There is a column of maroon added to the left of the bottom half.\n    *   The intersection of the added maroon row and the conceptual added column is also maroon.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
