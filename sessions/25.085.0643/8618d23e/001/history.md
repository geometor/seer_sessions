Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size Change**: The output grid is always one row taller and one column wider than the input grid.
    *   train\_1: Input 4x2 -> Output 5x3
    *   train\_2: Input 2x1 -> Output 3x2
    *   train\_3: Input 6x3 -> Output 7x4
2.  **New Color**: The color maroon (9) appears in the output grids but is not present in the input grids.
3.  **Structure Preservation**: The original patterns and colors from the input grid are preserved in the output grid, but their positions are altered.
4.  **Splitting and Shifting**: The input grid appears to be split horizontally into two equal halves.
    *   The top half of the input is placed in the top-left portion of the output grid.
    *   The bottom half of the input is placed in the bottom-right portion of the output grid.
5.  **Maroon Padding**: The maroon color (9) fills the space created by the resizing and shifting.
    *   There is a full row of maroon separating the top and bottom halves in the output grid. This row is located at the midpoint of the original grid's height. (e.g., if input height is H, this row is at index H/2 in the output).
    *   There is a column of maroon added to the right of the top half.
    *   There is a column of maroon added to the left of the bottom half.
    *   The intersection of the added maroon row and the conceptual added column is also maroon.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
resizing:
  height: input_height + 1
  width: input_width + 1
input_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: H
      width: W
      content: Original pixels
output_elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      height: H + 1
      width: W + 1
      content: Transformed pixels including original content and new padding
constants:
  padding_color: 9 # maroon
actions:
  - name: split_input_grid
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      axis: horizontal
      position: middle (row H/2)
    outputs:
      - top_half (rows 0 to H/2 - 1)
      - bottom_half (rows H/2 to H - 1)
  - name: create_output_grid
    parameters:
      height: H + 1
      width: W + 1
      initial_value: undefined # Or can be considered padding_color initially
  - name: place_top_half
    target: output_grid
    parameters:
      source: top_half
      target_location: top-left corner (rows 0 to H/2 - 1, cols 0 to W - 1)
  - name: place_bottom_half
    target: output_grid
    parameters:
      source: bottom_half
      target_location: bottom-right corner (rows H/2 + 1 to H, cols 1 to W)
  - name: fill_padding
    target: output_grid
    parameters:
      color: padding_color (9)
      locations:
        - full_row: H/2
        - partial_column_right: (col W, rows 0 to H/2 - 1)
        - partial_column_left: (col 0, rows H/2 + 1 to H)
relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions depend directly on the input grid dimensions.
  - The placement of the input halves in the output grid is fixed relative to the new grid boundaries and the padding.
  - The padding color (maroon 9) serves as a structural separator.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height H+1 and width W+1.
3.  Calculate the middle row index for splitting: `mid_row = H / 2`.
4.  Copy the top half of the input grid (from row 0 to `mid_row - 1`, all columns) into the output grid at the top-left position (rows 0 to `mid_row - 1`, columns 0 to `W - 1`).
5.  Copy the bottom half of the input grid (from row `mid_row` to `H - 1`, all columns) into the output grid at the bottom-right position (rows `mid_row + 1` to H, columns 1 to W).
6.  Fill the entire row at index `mid_row` in the output grid with the color maroon (9).
7.  Fill the cells in the last column (index W) of the output grid, from row 0 to `mid_row - 1`, with the color maroon (9).
8.  Fill the cells in the first column (index 0) of the output grid, from row `mid_row + 1` to H, with the color maroon (9).
9.  Return the resulting output grid.
