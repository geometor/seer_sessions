task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - description: Input and output grids are 2D arrays of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - input_dimensions: Variable height (H) and width (W). (Observed as 3x3 in examples).
  - output_dimensions: Height is 2 * H, Width is W. (Observed as 6x3 in examples).
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    description: The entire input grid is treated as a single object.
actions:
  - name: copy
    input: input_grid
    output: copy_of_input_grid
    description: Create an identical copy of the input grid.
  - name: reflect_vertical
    input: input_grid
    output: reflected_grid
    description: Create a new grid by flipping the input grid vertically (upside down). The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last, etc.
  - name: concatenate_vertical
    input: [copy_of_input_grid, reflected_grid]
    output: output_grid
    description: Stack the copy_of_input_grid on top of the reflected_grid to form the final output grid.
relationships:
  - description: The top H rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
  - description: The bottom H rows of the output grid are a vertical reflection of the input grid.
  - description: The output grid height is twice the input grid height.
  - description: The output grid width is the same as the input grid width.
