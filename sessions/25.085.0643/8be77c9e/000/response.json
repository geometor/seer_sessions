Observing the relationship between the input and output grids, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking the original input grid and appending a vertically mirrored version of it directly below. The original input grid occupies the top half of the output grid, and its reflection occupies the bottom half. The reflection occurs across the horizontal axis located at the bottom edge of the original input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
