**Perception:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. In all provided examples, the input grid is a 3x3 grid, and the output grid is a 6x3 grid. Observing the relationship between the input and output grids, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking the original input grid and appending a vertically mirrored version of it directly below. The original input grid occupies the top half of the output grid, and its reflection occupies the bottom half. The reflection occurs across the horizontal axis located at the bottom edge of the original input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: transformation
grid_properties:
  - description: Input and output grids are 2D arrays of pixels (integers 0-9).
  - input_dimensions: Variable height (H) and width (W). (Observed as 3x3 in examples).
  - output_dimensions: Height is 2 * H, Width is W. (Observed as 6x3 in examples).
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    description: The entire input grid is treated as a single object.
actions:
  - name: copy
    input: input_grid
    output: copy_of_input_grid
    description: Create an identical copy of the input grid.
  - name: reflect_vertical
    input: input_grid
    output: reflected_grid
    description: Create a new grid by flipping the input grid vertically (upside down). The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last, etc.
  - name: concatenate_vertical
    input: [copy_of_input_grid, reflected_grid]
    output: output_grid
    description: Stack the copy_of_input_grid on top of the reflected_grid to form the final output grid.
relationships:
  - description: The top H rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
  - description: The bottom H rows of the output grid are a vertical reflection of the input grid.
  - description: The output grid height is twice the input grid height.
  - description: The output grid width is the same as the input grid width.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Create a vertically reflected version of the input grid (flip it upside down).
3.  Construct the output grid by placing the original input grid in the top portion and the vertically reflected grid in the bottom portion, directly below the original. The final output grid will have the same width as the input grid but twice the height.
