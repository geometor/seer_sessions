Find the single red pixel (2) in the input grid. Create an output grid of the same size, initialized to white (0). Place specific colored pixels (green=3, magenta=6, azure=8, orange=7) diagonally around the original red pixel's location in the output grid, but only if the target diagonal position falls within the grid boundaries.
