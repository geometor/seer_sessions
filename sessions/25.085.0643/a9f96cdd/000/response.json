The output grids are also 3x5, but the red pixel is replaced, and new colored pixels appear around the original red pixel's location. Specifically, green (3), magenta (6), azure (8), and orange (7) pixels are placed in positions diagonally adjacent to where the red pixel was.\n\n*   Green (3) appears diagonally Up-Left.\n*   Magenta (6) appears diagonally Up-Right.\n*   Azure (8) appears diagonally Down-Left.\n*   Orange (7) appears diagonally Down-Right.\n\nThe placement of these new pixels is conditional on whether the target diagonal position falls within the grid boundaries. If a diagonal position is outside the grid, the corresponding colored pixel is not placed. The original position of the red pixel becomes white in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
