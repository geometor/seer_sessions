No colors are changed, added, or removed within the copied section.\n3.  **Location of Subgrid:** The location of the extracted 2x2 subgrid seems to vary:\n    *   In example 1 (4x4 input), the top-right 2x2 subgrid is extracted.\n    *   In example 2 (3x3 input), the top-left 2x2 subgrid is extracted.\n    *   In example 3 (5x5 input), the top-left 2x2 subgrid is extracted.\n4.  **Pattern in Location:** There seems to be a correlation between the width of the input grid and the corner from which the 2x2 subgrid is taken.\n    *   Even width (4) -> Top-Right corner.\n    *   Odd widths (3, 5) -> Top-Left corner.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
