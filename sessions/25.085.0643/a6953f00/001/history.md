Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size Changes:** The input grids have varying dimensions (4x4, 3x3, 5x5), while all output grids are consistently 2x2.
2.  **Content Relationship:** The output grid appears to be a direct copy of a 2x2 section from the input grid. No colors are changed, added, or removed within the copied section.
3.  **Location of Subgrid:** The location of the extracted 2x2 subgrid seems to vary:
    *   In example 1 (4x4 input), the top-right 2x2 subgrid is extracted.
    *   In example 2 (3x3 input), the top-left 2x2 subgrid is extracted.
    *   In example 3 (5x5 input), the top-left 2x2 subgrid is extracted.
4.  **Pattern in Location:** There seems to be a correlation between the width of the input grid and the corner from which the 2x2 subgrid is taken.
    *   Even width (4) -> Top-Right corner.
    *   Odd widths (3, 5) -> Top-Left corner.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
2.  Check if the width of the input grid is an even or odd number.
3.  If the width is even, extract the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-right corner of the input grid (rows 0 and 1, columns width-2 and width-1).
4.  If the width is odd, extract the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid (rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1).
5.  The extracted 2x2 subgrid is the output grid.
