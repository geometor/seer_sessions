task_type: geometric_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimension_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
transformation:
  - type: rotation
  - angle_degrees: 180
  - center: center of the grid
pixel_mapping:
  - rule: Each pixel at input coordinates (row, col) moves to output coordinates (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - col), where height and width are the dimensions of the grid.
  - color_preservation: The color of the pixel remains unchanged during the move.
