Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of the elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids in both examples are 3x3 squares.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow(4), gray (5), orange (7), and azure (8). The set of non-white colors present in the input of an example seems to be exactly the same as the set of non-white colors in the corresponding output.
3.  **Pixel Arrangement:** The arrangement of colored pixels (non-white pixels) changes from the input to the output.
4.  **Transformation Type:** The change in arrangement appears to be a geometric transformation. Comparing the position of each pixel in the input to its position in the output suggests a rotation.
5.  **Specific Transformation:**
    *   In `train_1`: The pixel at (0,0) (gray) moves to (2,2). The pixel at (0,1) (gray) moves to (2,1). The pixel at (0,2) (red) moves to (2,0). The pixel at (1,0) (blue) moves to (1,2). This pattern is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.
    *   In `train_2`: The pixel at (0,0) (green) moves to (2,2). The pixel at (0,1) (green) moves to (2,1). The pixel at (0,2) (azure) moves to (2,0). The pixel at (1,0) (green) moves to (1,2). The pixel at (1,1) (orange) stays at (1,1). The pixel at (2,0) (gray) moves to (0,2). This pattern is also consistent with a 180-degree rotation.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: geometric_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimension_relation: input and output grids have the same dimensions.
transformation:
  - type: rotation
  - angle_degrees: 180
  - center: center of the grid
pixel_mapping:
  - rule: Each pixel at input coordinates (row, col) moves to output coordinates (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - col), where height and width are the dimensions of the grid.
  - color_preservation: The color of the pixel remains unchanged during the move.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  For each pixel in the input grid located at coordinates (row, column):
    a.  Calculate the target coordinates in the output grid as (height - 1 - row, width - 1 - column).
    b.  Copy the color of the input pixel at (row, column) to the target coordinates in the output grid.
4.  Return the completed output grid.
