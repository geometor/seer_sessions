            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids in both examples are 3x3 squares.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors used are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow(4), gray (5), orange (7), and azure (8). The set of non-white colors present in the input of an example seems to be exactly the same as the set of non-white colors in the corresponding output.\n3.  **Pixel Arrangement:** The arrangement of colored pixels (non-white pixels) changes from the input to the output.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** The change in arrangement appears to be a geometric transformation. Comparing the position of each pixel in the input to its position in the output suggests a rotation.\n5.  **Specific Transformation:**\n    *   In `train_1`: The pixel at (0,0) (gray) moves to (2,2). The pixel at (0,1) (gray) moves to (2,1). The pixel at (0,2) (red) moves to (2,0). The pixel at (1,0) (blue) moves to (1,2). This pattern is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   In `train_2`: The pixel at (0,0) (green) moves to (2,2). The pixel at (0,1) (green) moves to (2,1). The pixel at (0,2) (azure) moves to (2,0). The pixel at (1,0) (green) moves to (1,2). The pixel at (1,1) (orange) stays at (1,1). The pixel at (2,0) (gray) moves to (0,2). This pattern is also consistent with a 180-degree rotation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
