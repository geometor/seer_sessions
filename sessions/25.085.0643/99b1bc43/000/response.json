Comparing corresponding cells (e.g., input upper[0,0] and input lower[0,0] to produce output[0,0]).\n    *   The rule for combination appears to be related to whether the corresponding cells in the upper and lower sections are non-white.\n        *   If one cell is non-white (blue or red) and the other is white (0), the output cell is green (3).\n        *   If both cells are white (0), the output cell is white (0).\n        *   If the upper cell is blue (1) and the lower cell is red (2), the output cell is white (0).\n    *   This logic is equivalent to a bitwise XOR operation if we consider white (0) as 0 and blue (1)/red (2) as 1. The result is green (3) if the XOR result is 1, and white (0) if the XOR result is 0.\n\n*   **Facts**\n    "
