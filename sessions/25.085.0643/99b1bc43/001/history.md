*   **Perception**
    *   The input grids consistently have dimensions 9x4.
    *   A distinct horizontal line of yellow pixels (color 4) is present in the middle (row 4) of every input grid, separating it into an upper 4x4 section and a lower 4x4 section.
    *   The upper section (rows 0-3) contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
    *   The lower section (rows 5-8) contains red (2) and white (0) pixels.
    *   The output grids are always 4x4.
    *   The output grids contain green (3) and white (0) pixels.
    *   The transformation appears to involve combining the upper 4x4 section and the lower 4x4 section of the input grid to produce the 4x4 output grid.
    *   The combination seems to happen on a cell-by-cell basis. Comparing corresponding cells (e.g., input upper[0,0] and input lower[0,0] to produce output[0,0]).
    *   The rule for combination appears to be related to whether the corresponding cells in the upper and lower sections are non-white.
        *   If one cell is non-white (blue or red) and the other is white (0), the output cell is green (3).
        *   If both cells are white (0), the output cell is white (0).
        *   If the upper cell is blue (1) and the lower cell is red (2), the output cell is white (0).
    *   This logic is equivalent to a bitwise XOR operation if we consider white (0) as 0 and blue (1)/red (2) as 1. The result is green (3) if the XOR result is 1, and white (0) if the XOR result is 0.

      rule: |
        For each cell position (row, col) from 0 to 3:
        Let upper_cell = upper_subgrid[row, col]
        Let lower_cell = lower_subgrid[row, col]
        If (upper_cell is blue (1) AND lower_cell is white (0)) OR (upper_cell is white (0) AND lower_cell is red (2)), then output_grid[row, col] is green (3).
        Otherwise (both white, or one blue and one red), output_grid[row, col] is white (0).
      alternative_rule_description: Treat white as 0, blue as 1, red as 1. Perform XOR. If result is 1, output green (3). If result is 0, output white (0).

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**
    1.  Identify the 4x4 subgrid in the top four rows (rows 0-3) of the input grid (let's call this `upper_grid`).
    2.  Identify the 4x4 subgrid in the bottom four rows (rows 5-8) of the input grid (let's call this `lower_grid`). The yellow separator line in row 4 is ignored.
    3.  Create a new 4x4 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
    4.  Iterate through each cell position `(row, col)` from `(0, 0)` to `(3, 3)`.
    5.  For the current position `(row, col)`, get the color of the cell from `upper_grid` (let this be `upper_color`) and the color of the cell from `lower_grid` (let this be `lower_color`).
    6.  Apply the combination rule:
        *   If `upper_color` is blue (1) and `lower_color` is white (0), set the output grid cell at `(row, col)` to green (3).
        *   Else if `upper_color` is white (0) and `lower_color` is red (2), set the output grid cell at `(row, col)` to green (3).
        *   Else (if both are white, or if `upper_color` is blue and `lower_color` is red), set the output grid cell at `(row, col)` to white (0).
    7.  Return the generated 4x4 output grid.
