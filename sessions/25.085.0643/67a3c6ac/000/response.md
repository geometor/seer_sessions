*   **Perception of the elements**:
    *   The inputs and outputs are grids of pixels with varying dimensions (7x7, 4x4, 6x6).
    *   The colors used in the input grids are preserved in the output grids. No new colors are introduced, and no existing colors are removed (though their counts might change if the transformation involved deletion, which isn't the case here).
    *   Comparing the input and output grids for each example, the arrangement of pixels within each row appears to be reversed. The first pixel in an input row becomes the last pixel in the corresponding output row, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
    *   The overall structure of the grid (number of rows and columns) remains unchanged.
    *   The transformation seems to be a geometric operation: a horizontal reflection (or flip) applied independently to each row.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: geometric_transformation
    input_entity: grid
    output_entity: grid
    properties:
      - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
      - pixel_colors: The set of pixel colors present in the input is identical to the set in the output.
    transformation:
      type: reflection
      axis: horizontal
      scope: per_row
    relationships:
      - input_pixel_at(row, col) maps_to output_pixel_at(row, input_width - 1 - col)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    2.  For the current row, reverse the order of its pixels.
    3.  Place the reversed row into the corresponding row position in the output grid.
    4.  The resulting grid, containing all the reversed rows, is the final output.
