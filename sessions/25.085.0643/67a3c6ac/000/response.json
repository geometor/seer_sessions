No new colors are introduced, and no existing colors are removed (though their counts might change if the transformation involved deletion, which isn't the case here).\n    *   Comparing the input and output grids for each example, the arrangement of pixels within each row appears to be reversed. The first pixel in an input row becomes the last pixel in the corresponding output row, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.\n    *   The overall structure of the grid (number of rows and columns) remains unchanged.\n    *   The transformation seems to be a geometric operation: a horizontal reflection (or flip) applied independently to each row.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
