If an input pixel is at row `r` and column `c`, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid occupies rows `r*3` to `r*3 + 2` and columns `c*3` to `c*3 + 2`.\n    *   This transformation is essentially an upscaling or magnification of the input grid by a factor of 3, where each original pixel becomes a 3x3 square of the same color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
