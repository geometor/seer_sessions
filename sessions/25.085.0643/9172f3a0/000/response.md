*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a small grid (3x3 in the examples).
    *   The output is a larger grid (9x9 in the examples), exactly 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid.
    *   Each pixel in the input grid seems to correspond to a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid.
    *   The position of the 3x3 block in the output grid is determined by the position of the corresponding pixel in the input grid. If an input pixel is at row `r` and column `c`, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid occupies rows `r*3` to `r*3 + 2` and columns `c*3` to `c*3 + 2`.
    *   This transformation is essentially an upscaling or magnification of the input grid by a factor of 3, where each original pixel becomes a 3x3 square of the same color.

*   **Facts:**

    task_type: upscaling
    input_grid:
      description: A grid of pixels with varying colors.
      properties:
        height: H_in
        width: W_in
    output_grid:
      description: A larger grid derived from the input grid.
      properties:
        height: H_out

      relationship_to_input:
        - H_out = H_in * 3
        - W_out = W_in * 3
        - Contains 3x3 blocks of uniform color.
    transformation:
      type: pixel_mapping_and_scaling
      mapping:
        - Each pixel at position (r, c) in the input grid with color 'X'.
        - Corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid.
        - The block is located starting at row (r * 3) and column (c * 3).
        - All pixels within this 3x3 block have the color 'X'.
      scale_factor: 3
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        in_input: individual cell with a color
        in_output: becomes part of a 3x3 block
      - type: block
        in_output: 3x3 area of uniform color corresponding to an input pixel
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the dimensions (height `H_in`, width `W_in`) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `H_out = H_in * 3` and `W_out = W_in * 3`.
    3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at row `r` (from 0 to `H_in - 1`) and column `c` (from 0 to `W_in - 1`).
    4.  Get the color `X` of the input pixel at `(r, c)`.
    5.  In the output grid, fill the 3x3 block starting at row `r * 3` and column `c * 3` entirely with the color `X`. This block covers rows `r*3`, `r*3 + 1`, `r*3 + 2` and columns `c*3`, `c*3 + 1`, `c*3 + 2`.
    6.  Return the completed output grid.
