Okay, analyzing the provided example pair:

**Perception**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid.
2.  The output is a 3x6 grid. The height remains the same, while the width doubles.
3.  Visually comparing the input and output, the left half (first 3 columns) of the output grid is identical to the input grid.
4.  The right half (last 3 columns) of the output grid appears to be a mirror image (horizontal reflection) of the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
- task: Reflection and Concatenation
  input_grid:
    height: 3
    width: 3
  output_grid:
    height: 3
    width: 6
  relationship:
    - type: dimension_change
      input_height: H
      input_width: W
      output_height: H
      output_width: 2 * W
    - type: composition
      description: The output grid is formed by placing the original input grid side-by-side with a transformed version of the input grid.
      output_left_half:
        source: input_grid
        transformation: identity
      output_right_half:
        source: input_grid
        transformation: horizontal_reflection
  objects:
    - id: input_grid
      description: The entire input grid treated as a single object.
  actions:
    - action: reflect
      axis: horizontal
      target: input_grid
      result: reflected_grid
    - action: concatenate
      direction: horizontal
      elements:

      result: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Create a horizontally reflected copy of the input grid.
3.  Construct the output grid by placing the original input grid on the left and the horizontally reflected copy immediately to its right. The resulting grid will have the same height as the input and twice the width.
