The corresponding output grids are all 9 rows high and 3 columns wide. The width remains constant, while the height increases by 50% (from 6 to 9, which is 6 + 6/2).\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. It appears that every blue (1) pixel in the input is transformed into a red (2) pixel in the output, while white (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n3.  **Content Relationship:** The output grid seems to be constructed from the input grid. The first 6 rows of the output grid are identical to the input grid, except for the color change (blue to red). The last 3 rows of the output grid appear to be a copy of the first 3 rows of the (color-transformed) grid.\n4.  **Operation:** The transformation involves two main steps: a color change (pixel-wise replacement) and a structural change (copying and appending a portion of the grid). The portion copied and appended is the top half (first H/2 rows) of the grid after the color transformation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
