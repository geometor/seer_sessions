This occurs only in Example 2.\n- Otherwise, the appended rows start from index 0 of the modified grid (rows 0, 1, 2). This occurs in Examples 1 and 3.\n- The previous code failed on Example 2 because it always appended rows starting from index 0.\n\nNow, I will formulate the report.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully implements the color transformation (blue to red) observed in all examples. However, it fails on Example 2 due to an incorrect assumption about the structural transformation (appending rows). The code assumes the top half (rows 0 to `H // 2 - 1`) of the color-modified grid is always appended. Analysis of Example 2 reveals that under specific conditions, a different contiguous block of rows from the modified grid should be appended.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to:\n1.  Identify the precise condition that differentiates Example 2 from Examples 1 and 3.\n2.  Determine the alternative block of rows that should be appended when this condition is met.\n3.  Update the transformation logic to incorporate this conditional behavior.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered and analyzed using code execution:\n\n"

The number of rows appended is consistently `H // 2 = 3`.\n    *   The key difference lies in *which* 3 rows are appended. The appended rows always come from the grid *after* the color transformation.\n    *   **Condition:** The content of the row at index `H // 2` (which is index 3 for `H=6`) in the *original input grid* determines the starting index for the rows to be appended.\n        *   If input row `H // 2` is `[white, blue, blue]` (i.e., `[0, 1, 1]`), as seen in Example 2, the appended rows are taken from the modified grid starting at index 2 (rows 2, 3, 4).\n        *   Otherwise (as seen in Examples 1 and 3), the appended rows are taken from the modified grid starting at index 0 (rows 0, 1, 2).\n    *   The previous code incorrectly always used a starting index of 0, leading to the failure in Example 2.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
