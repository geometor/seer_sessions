The output grid consists primarily of the gray background color, with a single 2x2 square of red color placed in the bottom right quadrant. The key seems to be identifying the location of the red pixel in the input grid and using that location to determine the position of the 2x2 red square in the output grid. All other colors from the input are disregarded in the output, replaced by the gray background color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
