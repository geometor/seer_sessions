*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a 4x4 input grid into a 4x4 output grid. The input grid contains several different colors scattered on a gray background. The output grid consists primarily of the gray background color, with a single 2x2 square of red color placed in the bottom right quadrant. The key seems to be identifying the location of the red pixel in the input grid and using that location to determine the position of the 2x2 red square in the output grid. All other colors from the input are disregarded in the output, replaced by the gray background color.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: single_object_transformation
    grid_properties:
      - input_dimensions: 4x4
      - output_dimensions: 4x4
      - background_color: gray (6)
    input_objects:
      - object: target_pixel
        color: red (2)
        location: (2, 3) # row, column (0-indexed)
        count: 1
      - object: noise_pixels
        colors: [maroon (9), blue (1), yellow (4), dark_gray (5)]
        locations: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 2)]
    output_objects:
      - object: target_square
        shape: 2x2
        color: red (2)
        location_top_left: (2, 2) # row, column (0-indexed)
        pixels: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
    relationships:
      - relation: placement_rule
        description: The top-left corner of the output red square is located at (target_pixel.row, target_pixel.column - 1).
      - relation: color_mapping
        description: The color of the output square is the same as the color of the input target_pixel (red).
      - relation: background_fill
        description: All cells in the output grid not part of the target_square are filled with the background_color (gray).
      - relation: noise_removal
        description: All non-red, non-background pixels from the input grid are ignored and replaced by the background color in the output.
    assumptions:
      - There is exactly one red (2) pixel in the input grid.
      - The red (2) pixel is not located in the first column or the last row of the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling all cells with the background color gray (6).
    2.  Locate the single pixel with the color red (2) in the input grid. Let its coordinates be `(row, col)`.
    3.  Determine the coordinates for a 2x2 square in the output grid: `(row, col - 1)`, `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col - 1)`, and `(row + 1, col)`.
    4.  Change the color of these four cells in the output grid to red (2).
