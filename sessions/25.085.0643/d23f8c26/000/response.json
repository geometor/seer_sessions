All pixels outside this central column in the input are replaced with white (0) in the output.\n    *   The center column index seems to be calculated based on the grid's width (e.g., for width 5, the index is 2; for width 3, the index is 1). This corresponds to integer division of `(width - 1) / 2`.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
