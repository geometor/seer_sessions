*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is always a 3x3 grid of pixels.
    *   The output is always a 3x12 grid of pixels.
    *   The output grid's height matches the input grid's height.
    *   The output grid's width is exactly four times the input grid's width (12 = 4 * 3).
    *   Comparing the input and output grids reveals a repeating pattern in the output. The output seems composed of blocks related to the input.
    *   Specifically, the output appears to be constructed by horizontally concatenating four 3x3 blocks.
    *   Observing the content of these blocks across the examples suggests a relationship involving the original input grid and a horizontally flipped version of it.
    *   The first 3x3 block of the output matches the input grid flipped horizontally.
    *   The second 3x3 block of the output matches the original input grid.
    *   This pattern of [flipped input, original input] repeats once more to form the complete 3x12 output.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: horizontal_tiling_with_flip
    input_attributes:
      - grid_dimensions: 3x3 (fixed)
    output_attributes:
      - grid_dimensions: 3x12 (fixed)
      - composition: formed by concatenating four 3x3 subgrids horizontally
    transformation:
      - name: horizontal_flip
        input: input_grid
        output: flipped_grid (3x3)
      - name: horizontal_concatenation
        inputs: [flipped_grid, input_grid, flipped_grid, input_grid]
        output: output_grid (3x12)
    relationships:
      - output_width = 4 * input_width
      - output_height = input_height
      - The output grid tiles the input grid and its horizontal reflection in an alternating pattern.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input grid.
    2.  Generate a new grid by flipping the input grid horizontally (reflecting it left-to-right). Call this the `flipped_grid`.
    3.  Construct the output grid by horizontally concatenating the `flipped_grid`, the original `input_grid`, the `flipped_grid` again, and the original `input_grid` again, in that specific order.
    4.  The resulting grid is the final output.
