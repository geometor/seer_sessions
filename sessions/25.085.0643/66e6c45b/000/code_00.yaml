task_context:
  grid_size_input: Fixed (4x4 in examples) # Assumption: Size might vary but remains square? Or input/output sizes match.
  grid_size_output: Same as input (4x4 in examples)
  background_color: white (0)

input_elements:
  - object_type: block
    description: A 2x2 square of contiguous non-white pixels.
    properties:
      - composition: Contains exactly four pixels.
      - colors: All four pixels are non-white. Colors can vary between examples.
      - location: Appears centered in the examples (top-left at (1,1) in a 4x4 grid). Need to confirm if location is always central or just needs to be found.
    pixels:
      - relative_pos: top-left
      - relative_pos: top-right
      - relative_pos: bottom-left
      - relative_pos: bottom-right

output_elements:
  - object_type: pixels
    description: Four individual non-white pixels located at the corners of the grid.
    properties:
      - colors: Identical to the colors of the pixels in the input 2x2 block.
      - count: Exactly four non-white pixels.
    locations:
      - corner: top-left (0, 0)
      - corner: top-right (0, width-1)
      - corner: bottom-left (height-1, 0)
      - corner: bottom-right (height-1, width-1)
  - object_type: background
    description: Fills the rest of the grid.
    properties:
      - color: white (0)

transformations:
  - action: identify
    target: The 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    details: Find the top-left coordinate (r, c) such that pixels at (r, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c), and (r+1, c+1) are all non-white.
  - action: create_output_grid
    details: Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the background color (white).
  - action: relocate_pixels
    source: The identified 2x2 block in the input grid.
    destination: The corners of the output grid.
    mapping:
      - input_pos: top-left of block (r, c) -> output_pos: top-left corner (0, 0)
      - input_pos: top-right of block (r, c+1) -> output_pos: top-right corner (0, width-1)
      - input_pos: bottom-left of block (r+1, c) -> output_pos: bottom-left corner (height-1, 0)
      - input_pos: bottom-right of block (r+1, c+1) -> output_pos: bottom-right corner (height-1, width-1)

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    elements: [colors]
    details: The colors of the four key pixels are preserved from input to output.
  - type: spatial_mapping
    elements: [input_block_pixels, output_corner_pixels]
    details: The relative arrangement within the 2x2 block maps directly to the corner positions (e.g., top-left maps to top-left).
