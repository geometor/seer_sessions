            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids provided are 4x4. They consist primarily of a `white` background (color 0).\n2.  **Key Feature:** Embedded within the `white` background is a 2x2 square composed of four different non-`white` colored pixels. In both examples, this 2x2 block is centered at row 1, column 1 (using 0-based indexing).\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are also 4x4 and maintain the `white` background.\n4.  **Transformation:** The four colored pixels originally forming the 2x2 block in the input are relocated to the four corners of the output grid.\n5.  **Positional Mapping:** The relocation preserves the relative positions:\n    *   The pixel at the top-left of the input 2x2 block moves to the top-left corner of the output grid.\n    *   The pixel at the top-right of the input 2x2 block moves to the top-right corner of the output grid.\n    *   The pixel at the bottom-left of the input 2x2 block moves to the bottom-left corner of the output grid.\n    *   The pixel at the bottom-right of the input 2x2 block moves to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.\n6.  **Background:** All other positions in the output grid are filled with the `white` background color (0).\n7.  **Consistency:** This pattern holds true for both provided examples (`train_1` and `train_2`).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
