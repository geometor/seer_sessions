The first row has one color (let's call it C1), and the second row has a different color (let's call it C2).\n\nThe output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows, same number of columns). The output grid is generated by creating an alternating pattern using the two colors from the input rows.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The first row of the output grid alternates between C1 and C2, starting with C1 (C1, C2, C1, C2, ...).\n- The second row of the output grid alternates between C2 and C1, starting with C2 (C2, C1, C2, C1, ...).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
