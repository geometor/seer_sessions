Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n\nThis error strongly indicates that the `input_grid` variable, which the code assumes to be a standard Python list of lists, is actually being passed as a NumPy array in the testing environment. The specific line causing the error is likely `if not input_grid[0]:`, which attempts to check if the first row is empty. For a NumPy array, evaluating its truthiness directly (e.g., in a boolean context like `if`) is ambiguous unless it contains zero or one element. NumPy requires explicit methods like `.any()` (is at least one element true?) or `.all()` (are all elements true?) for boolean evaluation of multi-element arrays, or checking its `.size` attribute.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Confirm Data Structure:** The primary issue seems to be a mismatch between the assumed data structure (list of lists) and the actual data structure (NumPy array). We need to confirm this and adjust the code accordingly.\n2.  **Review Examples:** We need the actual input/output grids for the examples that caused the errors (Example 1 and Example 2) to verify if the core transformation logic (alternating colors based on the first two rows) is still correct or if it needs refinement based on potentially different input patterns. The original logic was derived from only *one* example.\n3.  **Update Code:** Modify the Python code to correctly handle NumPy arrays (e.g., use `input_grid.shape` for dimensions, check emptiness using `.size`, potentially convert output to NumPy array if required by the testing environment).\n4.  **Refine NL Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect any changes in the transformation logic discovered from the new examples and explicitly mention the data type.\n\n**Constraint:** I cannot proceed effectively without the specific input and output grids for the examples that caused the errors. The following sections are based on the interpretation of the error message and the original task description, assuming the core logic might still be related to alternating colors.\n\n## Metrics\n\nCannot gather metrics without the input/output data for the provided examples. Access to the `train` examples (inputs and outputs) is required to determine grid dimensions, color usage, object shapes, etc.\n\n"
