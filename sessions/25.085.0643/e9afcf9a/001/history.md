## Perception

The input consists of a grid with two rows and multiple columns. Each row is filled with a single, uniform color. The first row has one color (let's call it C1), and the second row has a different color (let's call it C2).

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows, same number of columns). The output grid is generated by creating an alternating pattern using the two colors from the input rows.

Specifically:
- The first row of the output grid alternates between C1 and C2, starting with C1 (C1, C2, C1, C2, ...).
- The second row of the output grid alternates between C2 and C1, starting with C2 (C2, C1, C2, C1, ...).

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - grid_dimensions: 2 rows, N columns (where N=6 in the examples)
  - structure: Two horizontal lines (rows)
  - row_1: Uniform color C1
  - row_2: Uniform color C2
output_properties:
  - grid_dimensions: Same as input (2 rows, N columns)
  - structure: Two horizontal lines (rows) with alternating patterns
  - row_1: Alternating pattern C1, C2, C1, C2, ...
  - row_2: Alternating pattern C2, C1, C2, C1, ...
objects:
  - name: input_row_1
    type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C1
      row_index: 0
  - name: input_row_2
    type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: C2
      row_index: 1
actions:
  - name: identify_colors
    inputs: [input_row_1, input_row_2]
    outputs: [C1, C2]
  - name: determine_dimensions
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [height, width]
  - name: generate_output_row_1
    inputs: [C1, C2, width]
    rule: Iterate through columns 0 to width-1. If column index is even, use C1; if odd, use C2.
  - name: generate_output_row_2
    inputs: [C1, C2, width]
    rule: Iterate through columns 0 to width-1. If column index is even, use C2; if odd, use C1.
relationships:
  - Output row 1 pattern depends on the parity (even/odd) of the column index and uses C1 for even indices and C2 for odd indices.
  - Output row 2 pattern depends on the parity (even/odd) of the column index and uses C2 for even indices and C1 for odd indices.
  - Output grid dimensions are identical to input grid dimensions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Identify the color of the first row (row 0) as Color1 (C1).
3.  Identify the color of the second row (row 1) as Color2 (C2).
4.  Determine the width (W) of the input grid.
5.  Create a new output grid with 2 rows and W columns.
6.  For each column index `j` from 0 to W-1:
    a.  If `j` is even, set the pixel at `(0, j)` in the output grid to C1 and the pixel at `(1, j)` to C2.
    b.  If `j` is odd, set the pixel at `(0, j)` in the output grid to C2 and the pixel at `(1, j)` to C1.
7.  Return the generated output grid.
