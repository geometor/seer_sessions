"""
Transforms a 2xN input NumPy array into a 2xN output NumPy array with alternating colors.
The input array is assumed to have two rows, each with a uniform color (C1 and C2 respectively) identified from the first column.
The output array's first row alternates C1, C2, C1, ... starting with C1.
The output array's second row alternates C2, C1, C2, ... starting with C2.

Note: This logic is based on the initial interpretation and needs validation with the actual examples that caused the previous error. The code is updated to handle NumPy arrays.
