task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - grid:
      colors: [0, 5] # white, gray
      description: Smaller grid representing the initial state.
output_properties:
  - grid:
      colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
      size_relation_to_input: height doubles, width doubles
      description: Larger grid resulting from the transformation.
transformation:
  type: pixel_to_block_mapping
  scaling_factor: 2
  rules:
    - input_pixel_color: 0 # white
      output_block: [[0, 0], [0, 0]] # 2x2 white block
    - input_pixel_color: 5 # gray
      output_block: [[1, 2], [2, 1]] # 2x2 blue/red pattern block
  mapping_logic: Each pixel at (r, c) in the input maps to the 2x2 block starting at (r*2, c*2) in the output.
