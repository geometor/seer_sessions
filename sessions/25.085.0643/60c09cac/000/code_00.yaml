task_description: Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both height and width.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - input_grid: H x W dimensions
      - output_grid: (H*2) x (W*2) dimensions
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Any integer from 0-9
      - position: (row, column) coordinates in the grid
transformation:
  - action: scale
    details: Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  - mapping:
    input_pixel_at: (r, c) with color C
    output_block_top_left_at: (r*2, c*2) with size 2x2 and color C
relationship:
  - The output grid dimensions are double the input grid dimensions.
  - The position of the top-left corner of the 2x2 output block is determined by doubling the row and column indices of the corresponding input pixel.
