Specifically, the output grids appear to be exactly twice the height and twice the width of the corresponding input grids.\n    *   Each pixel in the input grid seems to correspond to a 2x2 block of pixels of the same color in the output grid.\n    *   The relative positions of the colored blocks in the output grid correspond to the relative positions of the colored pixels in the input grid, but scaled up.\n    *   The background color (white) also expands into 2x2 blocks.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel in the input grid at position (row `r`, column `c`) from `r = 0` to `H-1` and `c = 0` to `W-1`.\n4.  For each input pixel at (`r`, `c`), get its color `C`.\n5.  In the output grid, fill a 2x2 block of pixels with the color `C`. The top-left corner of this block will be at position (`r * 2`, `c * 2`). Specifically, the pixels at (`r * 2`, `c * 2`), (`r * 2 + 1`, `c * 2`), (`r * 2`, `c * 2 + 1`), and (`r * 2 + 1`, `c * 2 + 1`) in the output grid should all be set to color `C`.\n6.
