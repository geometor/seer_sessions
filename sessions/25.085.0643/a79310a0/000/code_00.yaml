task_context:
  - description: Grid transformation based on object movement and color change.
  - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width in each example.
  - background_color: White (0) is the predominant background color and remains unchanged unless replaced by a transformed object.

objects:
  - id: input_object
    description: Contiguous block(s) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: Varies (single pixel, 2x2 block, 1x3 block)
      - location: Specific coordinates within the input grid.
  - id: output_object
    description: Object derived from the input_object in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: Same shape as the corresponding input_object.
      - location: Shifted one row down compared to the corresponding input_object.

transformations:
  - action: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    target: pixels with color azure (8)
    output: Set of azure objects (groups of contiguous azure pixels).
  - action: translate_object
    input: azure object coordinates (row, col)
    parameter: vertical_shift = +1 row
    output: new coordinates (row + 1, col)
  - action: change_color
    input: translated azure pixels
    parameter: new_color = red (2)
    output: red pixels at the new coordinates.
  - action: generate_output
    steps:
      - Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
      - For each azure pixel at (row, col) in the input grid:
        - Calculate the target coordinates (new_row, new_col) = (row + 1, col).
        - If new_row is within the grid's height boundary:
          - Set the pixel at (new_row, new_col) in the new grid to red (2).
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: Each red pixel in the output grid is located one row directly below the corresponding azure pixel in the input grid.
  - type: color_mapping
    description: Azure (8) in the input maps to red (2) in the output after translation.
  - type: shape_preservation
    description: The shape and relative arrangement of pixels within an object are preserved during the transformation.
