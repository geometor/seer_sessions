These azure pixels always form one or more contiguous objects (single pixels or blocks). The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.\nIn the output grids, the azure objects are replaced by objects of the same shape but colored red (2). These red objects are positioned exactly one row below the original position of the azure objects in the input grid. Pixels that were originally white remain white. If moving an azure pixel down would place it outside the grid boundaries, that pixel is effectively removed (or rather, the corresponding output cell remains white).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
