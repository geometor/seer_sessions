They vary in size (height and width).\n2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They feature a border of azure pixels (8) surrounding an interior area.\n3.  **Interior Pixels:** The pixels inside the azure border retain the original color from the input, which is white (0). If the grid is only 1 or 2 pixels wide or high, there might be no interior pixels (e.g., a 2xN grid would have no interior white pixels).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the outermost pixels (the border) of the grid and changes their color to azure (8). The pixels not on the border remain unchanged (white).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Check if the cell is located on the border of the grid. A cell is on the border if its row index `r` is 0 or `H-1`, OR if its column index `c` is 0 or `W-1`.\n    b. If the cell is on the border, set the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).\n    c. If the cell is *not* on the border (i.e., it's in the interior), set the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the color of the input cell `(r, c)` (which is always white (0) in the examples provided, but generalizing is safer).\n5.  The resulting grid is the final output."
