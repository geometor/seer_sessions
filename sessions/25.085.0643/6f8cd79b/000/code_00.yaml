Examples:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array
      Content: Uniformly white (0) pixels
      Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 5x4, 4x3, 5x6, 3x3)
    Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array
      Content: Mixed pixels
      Dimensions: Same as input
      Objects:
        - Object: Border
          Color: Azure (8)
          Location: Outermost rows and columns (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1)
          Shape: Rectangular frame
        - Object: Interior
          Color: White (0)
          Location: Pixels not part of the border
          Shape: Rectangle (possibly empty if dimensions are small)
    Relationship:
      - The output grid's dimensions match the input grid's dimensions.
      - Pixels are categorized based on their location (border vs. interior).
    Action:
      - Change_Color: Pixels located on the border of the input grid are changed to azure (8) in the output grid.
      - Preserve_Color: Pixels located in the interior of the input grid retain their original color (white, 0) in the output grid.
