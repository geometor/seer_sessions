Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input Grids:** All input grids consist entirely of white pixels (0). They vary in size (height and width).
2.  **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids. They feature a border of azure pixels (8) surrounding an interior area.
3.  **Interior Pixels:** The pixels inside the azure border retain the original color from the input, which is white (0). If the grid is only 1 or 2 pixels wide or high, there might be no interior pixels (e.g., a 2xN grid would have no interior white pixels).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation identifies the outermost pixels (the border) of the grid and changes their color to azure (8). The pixels not on the border remain unchanged (white).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Examples:
  - Input_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array
      Content: Uniformly white (0) pixels
      Dimensions: Variable (e.g., 5x4, 4x3, 5x6, 3x3)
    Output_Grid:
      Type: 2D Array
      Content: Mixed pixels
      Dimensions: Same as input
      Objects:
        - Object: Border
          Color: Azure (8)
          Location: Outermost rows and columns (row 0, row H-1, column 0, column W-1)
          Shape: Rectangular frame
        - Object: Interior
          Color: White (0)
          Location: Pixels not part of the border
          Shape: Rectangle (possibly empty if dimensions are small)
    Relationship:
      - The output grid's dimensions match the input grid's dimensions.
      - Pixels are categorized based on their location (border vs. interior).
    Action:
      - Change_Color: Pixels located on the border of the input grid are changed to azure (8) in the output grid.
      - Preserve_Color: Pixels located in the interior of the input grid retain their original color (white, 0) in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Given an input grid of height `H` and width `W`.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions `H` x `W`.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).
4.  For each cell at `(r, c)`:
    a. Check if the cell is located on the border of the grid. A cell is on the border if its row index `r` is 0 or `H-1`, OR if its column index `c` is 0 or `W-1`.
    b. If the cell is on the border, set the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to azure (8).
    c. If the cell is *not* on the border (i.e., it's in the interior), set the color of the corresponding cell `(r, c)` in the output grid to the color of the input cell `(r, c)` (which is always white (0) in the examples provided, but generalizing is safer).
5.  The resulting grid is the final output.
