Task: Tiling pattern based on row transformation and flips

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Shape: 3x2 (Height x Width)
    - Content: Pixels represented by integers 0-9 (colors)
  Structure:
    - Consists of 3 rows, each containing 2 pixels [Pixel_A, Pixel_B].

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - Shape: 9x4 (Height x Width)
    - Content: Pixels derived from input grid colors.

Transformations:
  - Step 1: Row Expansion and Rearrangement
    - Action: Transform each input row `[A, B]` into a new 4-pixel row `[B, A, A, B]`.
    - Result: Creates 3 rows of 4 pixels each.
  - Step 2: Intermediate Grid Formation
    - Action: Stack the 3 transformed rows vertically in their original order.
    - Result: A 3x4 grid (let's call it `Intermediate_Direct`).
  - Step 3: Pattern Grid Generation (P)
    - Action: Perform a vertical flip (reverse row order) on the `Intermediate_Direct` grid.
    - Result: A 3x4 grid (let's call it `Pattern_Grid` or `P`).
  - Step 4: Flipped Pattern Grid Generation (P_flipped)
    - Action: Perform a vertical flip (reverse row order) on the `Pattern_Grid` (`P`).
    - Result: A 3x4 grid (let's call it `Flipped_Pattern_Grid` or `P_flipped`).
  - Step 5: Final Grid Assembly
    - Action: Vertically concatenate the grids `P`, `P_flipped`, and `P` in that specific order.
    - Result: The final 9x4 output grid.

Relationships:
  - The output grid's height is 3 times the height of the `Pattern_Grid`.
  - The output grid's width is 2 times the width of the input grid.
  - The middle 3x4 block of the output grid is a vertical flip of the top (and bottom) 3x4 block.
