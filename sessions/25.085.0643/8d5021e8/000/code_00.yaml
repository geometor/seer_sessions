Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    Height: 3
    Width: 2
    Structure: Composed of rows, each having 2 pixels (cells). Let a row be represented as [Pixel_A, Pixel_B].

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    Height: 9
    Width: 4
  Relationships:
    - Derived from Input_Grid through a series of transformations.

Transformation:
  Steps:
    1. Row_Transformation:
       - Input: A single row [Pixel_A, Pixel_B] from the Input_Grid.
       - Output: A new row [Pixel_B, Pixel_A, Pixel_A, Pixel_B].
       - Action: Apply this transformation to every row of the Input_Grid.
    2. Intermediate_Grid_Creation:
       - Input: The set of transformed rows from Step 1.
       - Output: An Intermediate_Grid with dimensions 3x4.
       - Action: Arrange the transformed rows in the same top-to-bottom order as the original Input_Grid rows.
    3. Vertical_Flip:
       - Input: The Intermediate_Grid (3x4).
       - Output: A Flipped_Intermediate_Grid (3x4).
       - Action: Reverse the order of the rows in the Intermediate_Grid.
    4. Tiling:
       - Input: The Flipped_Intermediate_Grid (3x4).
       - Output: The final Output_Grid (9x4).
       - Action: Vertically concatenate the Flipped_Intermediate_Grid with itself twice (tile it 3 times vertically).
