Conversely, wherever there is an azure (8) pixel in the input, there is a gray (5) pixel in the output.\n5.  **Consistency:** This pattern of swapping gray (5) and azure (8) holds true for all pixels in all three training examples. Pixels with other colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) remain unchanged.\n6.  **No Spatial Dependency:** The change applied to a pixel depends only on its own color, not on its neighbors or its position within the grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
