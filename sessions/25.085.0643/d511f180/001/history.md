## train_1

**input:**
```
3 5 1
4 5 8
2 4 9
```


**output:**
```
3 8 1
4 8 5
2 4 9
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
2 7 8 8 8
5 5 6 5 4
8 5 5 5 2
8 8 4 3 6
6 5 1 9 3
```


**output:**
```
2 7 5 5 5
8 8 6 8 4
5 8 8 8 2
5 5 4 3 6
6 8 1 9 3
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
6 5 3
5 7 5
8 8 2
```


**output:**
```
6 8 3
8 7 8
5 5 2
```

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions in each example.
2.  **Color Changes:** Comparing the input and output grids, I observe that only specific colors change, while others remain in the same position.
3.  **Specific Colors:** In all three examples, the colors gray (5) and azure (8) seem to be involved in the changes.
4.  **Symmetrical Change:** Looking closely, wherever there is a gray (5) pixel in the input, there is an azure (8) pixel in the corresponding position in the output. Conversely, wherever there is an azure (8) pixel in the input, there is a gray (5) pixel in the output.
5.  **Consistency:** This pattern of swapping gray (5) and azure (8) holds true for all pixels in all three training examples. Pixels with other colors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) remain unchanged.
6.  **No Spatial Dependency:** The change applied to a pixel depends only on its own color, not on its neighbors or its position within the grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions remain constant between input and output.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value from 0 to 9.
actions:
  - name: swap_colors
    target: pixels
    conditions:
      - input pixel color is gray (5)
      - input pixel color is azure (8)
    effects:
      - if color is gray (5), change to azure (8).
      - if color is azure (8), change to gray (5).
      - if color is neither gray (5) nor azure (8), keep the color unchanged.
relationships:
  - The transformation of a pixel depends solely on its individual color value.
  - There is a reciprocal relationship between gray (5) and azure (8): each is replaced by the other.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid, examining its color.
3.  If the color of the input pixel is gray (5), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to azure (8).
4.  If the color of the input pixel is azure (8), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to gray (5).
5.  If the color of the input pixel is any other color, set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the same color as the input pixel.
6.  The new grid is the output.
