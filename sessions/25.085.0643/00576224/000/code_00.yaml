task_description: Constructs a larger grid by tiling the input grid and its horizontally flipped version in a specific 3x3 pattern.
grid_properties:
  - scope: input
    attributes:
      height: H
      width: W
  - scope: output
    attributes:
      height: 3 * H
      width: 3 * W
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    description: The original HxW grid provided as input.
  - id: flipped_grid
    description: An HxW grid created by horizontally flipping the input_grid.

    grid_layout: 3 rows x 3 columns
    tile_size: H x W
    output_grid_dimensions: (3*H) x (3*W)
    tile_mapping:
      - tile_grid_coordinates: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)] # row, col
        source_grid: input_grid
      - tile_grid_coordinates: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)]
        source_grid: flipped_grid
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: The output grid is composed of 3 rows and 3 columns of tiles. Each tile is the size of the input grid. The tiles in the top and bottom rows are copies of the input grid. The tiles in the middle row are horizontally flipped copies of the input grid.
