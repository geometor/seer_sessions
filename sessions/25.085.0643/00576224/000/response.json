            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** In both examples, the input is a 2x2 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. The output dimensions are exactly 3 times the input dimensions in both height and width.\n2.  **Content Relationship:** The output grid appears to be constructed by repeating the input grid or a modified version of it.\n3.  **Pattern Identification:**\n    *   Let the input grid be denoted by `I`.\n    *   In `train_1`, `I = [[7, 9], [4, 3]]`. The output can be seen as a 3x3 arrangement of 2x2 blocks.\n        *   The blocks in the top row (0) and bottom row (2) are identical to `I`: `[[7, 9], [4, 3]]`.\n        *   The blocks in the middle row (1) are different: `[[9, 7], [3, 4]]`. This block is a horizontally flipped version of `I`.\n    *   In `train_2`, `I = [[8, 6], [6, 4]]`. The output also follows the 3x3 arrangement.\n        *   Top and bottom row blocks match `I`: `[[8, 6], [6, 4]]`.\n        *   Middle row blocks are `[[6, 8], [4, 6]]`. This is also a horizontally flipped version of `I`.\n4.  **Generalization:** The pattern seems consistent: create an output grid 3 times the size of the input grid. Tile this output grid with 3x3 blocks, where each block has the dimensions of the input grid. The blocks in the first and third rows of this 3x3 tiling are copies of the input grid. The blocks in the second (middle) row are horizontally flipped copies of the input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
