Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-white pixel colors.\n2.  Count the frequency of each unique non-white color.\n3.  If there are no non-white colors, the output is a 1x1 grid containing white (0).\n4.  If there is only one unique non-white color, C1, the output is a 1x1 grid \n    containing C1.\n5.  If there are two or more unique non-white colors:\n    a.  Identify the color with the highest frequency (C1) and its count (Count1).\n    b.  Identify the color with the second highest frequency (C2) and its count \n        (Count2). If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the lower \n        numerical value is chosen.\n    c.  Calculate the difference: Diff = Count1 - Count2.\n    d.  If Diff is exactly 1:\n        i.  Calculate the total count of all non-white pixels (Total).\n        ii. If Total is less than or equal to 15, the output is a 1x1 grid \n            containing C2.\n        iii. If Total is greater than 15, the output is a 2x2 grid with the \n             pattern [[C2, C2], [C2, C1]].\n    e.  If Diff is 2 or 3: The output is a 2x2 grid with the pattern \n        [[C2, C2], [C2, C1]].\n    f.  If Diff is greater than 3: The output is a 2x2 grid with the pattern \n        [[C1, C1], [C2, C1]].\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the frequency analysis of non-white colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert input to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Flatten the grid and filter out white pixels (color 0)\n    non_white_pixels = grid[grid != 0]\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each non-white color\n    color_counts = Counter(non_white_pixels)\n    \n    # Get the colors and their counts, sorted:\n    # Primary key: count descending (-item[1])\n    # Secondary key: color value ascending (item[0]) for tie-breaking\n    sorted_colors = sorted(color_counts.items(), key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))\n    \n    # Case 1: No non-white colors found\n    if not sorted_colors:\n        output_grid = np.array([[0]], dtype=int)\n        return output_grid.tolist() # Return as list of lists\n\n    # Get the most frequent color (C1) and its count (Count1)\n    c1, count1 = sorted_colors[0]\n    \n    # Case 2: Only one unique non-white color exists\n    if len(sorted_colors) == 1:\n        output_grid = np.array([[c1]], dtype=int)\n        return output_grid.tolist() # Return as list of lists\n\n    # Case 3: Two or more unique non-white colors exist\n    # Get the second most frequent color (C2) and its count (Count2)\n    c2, count2 = sorted_colors[1]\n    \n    # Calculate the difference in counts\n    diff = count1 - count2\n    \n    # Apply rules based on the difference (Diff)\n    if diff == 1:\n        # Calculate total number of non-white pixels\n        total_non_white = len(non_white_pixels)\n        if total_non_white <= 15:\n            # Output 1x1 grid with C2\n            output_grid = np.array([[c2]], dtype=int)\n        else:\n            # Output 2x2 grid with pattern [[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]\n            output_grid = np.array([[c2, c2], \n                                    [c2, c1]], dtype=int)\n    elif 1 < diff <= 3: # Diff is 2 or 3\n        # Output 2x2 grid with pattern [[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]\n        output_grid = np.array([[c2, c2], \n                                [c2, c1]], dtype=int)\n    else: # Diff > 3\n        # Output 2x2 grid with the pattern [[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]\n        output_grid = np.array([[c1, c1], \n                                [c2, c1]], dtype=int)\n                                \n    # Convert the final numpy array grid to a list of lists before returning\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
