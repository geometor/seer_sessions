"""
Transforms an input grid into a smaller output grid (1x1 or 2x2) based on the 
frequency analysis of non-white pixels (colors > 0).

1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-white pixel colors.
2.  Count the frequency of each unique non-white color.
3.  If there are no non-white colors, the output is a 1x1 grid containing white (0).
4.  If there is only one unique non-white color, C1, the output is a 1x1 grid 
    containing C1.
5.  If there are two or more unique non-white colors:
    a.  Identify the color with the highest frequency (C1) and its count (Count1).
    b.  Identify the color with the second highest frequency (C2) and its count 
        (Count2). If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the lower 
        numerical value is chosen.
    c.  Calculate the difference: Diff = Count1 - Count2.
    d.  If Diff is exactly 1:
        i.  Calculate the total count of all non-white pixels (Total).
        ii. If Total is less than or equal to 15, the output is a 1x1 grid 
            containing C2.
        iii. If Total is greater than 15, the output is a 2x2 grid with the 
             pattern [[C2, C2], [C2, C1]].
    e.  If Diff is 2 or 3: The output is a 2x2 grid with the pattern 
        [[C2, C2], [C2, C1]].
    f.  If Diff is greater than 3: The output is a 2x2 grid with the pattern 
        [[C1, C1], [C2, C1]].
