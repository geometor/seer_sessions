task_description: Transforms an input grid into a smaller output grid (1x1 or 2x2) based on the frequency analysis of non-white pixels.

observations:
  - The transformation depends on the counts of the non-white pixels.
  - White pixels (color 0) are ignored in the analysis but form the background of the output if no non-white pixels exist.
  - The output grid size is either 1x1 or 2x2.
  - Key factors are the frequencies of the two most common non-white colors (C1 and C2) and their difference (Diff = Count1 - Count2).
  - The total number of non-white pixels also plays a role when the top two counts are very close (Diff=1).

derived_properties:
  - Input grid: A 2D array of integers (colors).
  - Non-white pixels: Pixels with color > 0.
  - Color frequencies: A map of each non-white color to its count in the grid.
  - C1: The non-white color with the highest frequency.
  - C2: The non-white color with the second highest frequency. (Handle ties if necessary, e.g., by color index).
  - Count1: Frequency of C1.
  - Count2: Frequency of C2.
  - Diff: Difference between Count1 and Count2 (Count1 - Count2).
  - Total Non-White: Sum of frequencies of all non-white colors.

actions_and_transformations:
  - Filter out white pixels.
  - Count frequencies of remaining pixels.
  - Identify C1, Count1, C2, Count2.
  - Handle edge cases:
      - No non-white pixels: Output is `[[0]]`.
      - One unique non-white color C1: Output is `[[C1]]`.
  - Calculate Diff = Count1 - Count2.
  - Apply rules based on Diff:
      - If Diff = 1:
          - Calculate Total Non-White.
          - If Total <= 15: Output is `[[C2]]`.
          - If Total > 15: Output is `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`.
      - If 1 < Diff <= 3: Output is `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`.
      - If Diff > 3: Output is `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`.

output_grid_generation:
  - Create a 1x1 or 2x2 grid based on the determined rule and colors C1, C2.
