            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task based solely on the frequency difference between the two most common non-white colors. This logic succeeded for Example 2 but failed for Examples 1 and 3, indicating the rule is more complex.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   In Example 1, the counts were close (difference=1), and the code outputted the most frequent color (C1), but the expected output was the *second* most frequent color (C2).\n*   In Example 3, the counts were also close (difference=1). The previous code's logic dictated a 1x1 output of C1, but the expected output was a specific 2x2 pattern involving both C1 and C2, different from the pattern used in Example 2.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the transformation rule by incorporating additional factors observed across all examples. The key seems to be how to handle cases where the frequencies of the top two colors are very close (difference <= 1). The total count of non-white pixels appears to be a deciding factor in these close-count scenarios, determining both the output grid size and the specific pattern/color used.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's calculate the exact frequencies and properties for each example.\n"

            "text": "**Correction based on `tool_code` output:**\n\nMy manual counts were slightly off. Let's re-evaluate with the accurate counts:\n\n*   **Example 1:** C1=6(count=8), C2=8(count=7). Diff = 1. Total Non-White = 15. Expected Output: `[[8]]`.\n*   **Example 2:** C1=1(count=13), C2=2(count=8). Diff = 5. Total Non-White = 21. Expected Output: `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`.\n*   **Example 3:** C1=2(count=24), C2=5(count=21). Diff = 3. Total Non-White = 45. Expected Output: `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.\n\n**Revisiting the Hypothesis:**\n\nThe original hypothesis was based on Diff > 1 vs Diff <= 1.\nThe revised hypothesis incorporated Total Non-White count for the Diff <= 1 case, using a threshold of 20.\n\nLet's test the *revised* hypothesis with the *correct* counts:\n\n*   **Ex 1:** Diff=1 (<=1). Total=15 (<=20). Rule: Output `[[C2]]`. Output `[[8]]`. **Matches.**\n*   **Ex 2:** Diff=5 (>1). Rule: Output `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`. Output `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. **Matches.**\n*   **Ex 3:** Diff=3 (>1). Rule: Output `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`. Output `[[2, 2], [5, 2]]`. **Does NOT match.** Expected output is `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`.\n\nThe logic still fails for Example 3. The `tool_code` output shows Diff=3, which falls into the `Diff > 1` case according to the hypothesis. However, the expected output `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]` doesn't match the `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]` pattern derived from Example 2 (which would be `[[2, 2], [5, 2]]`).\n\n**Further Refinement:**\n\nLet's reconsider the conditions and outputs:\n\n*   Ex 1: Diff=1, Total=15. Output: `[[C2]]`. (1x1 grid)\n*   Ex 2: Diff=5, Total=21. Output: `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`. (2x2 grid)\n*   Ex 3: Diff=3, Total=45. Output: `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`. (2x2 grid)\n\nWhat distinguishes Ex 2 and Ex 3, both resulting in a 2x2 grid?\n*   Ex 2: Diff=5. Pattern `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`.\n*   Ex 3: Diff=3. Pattern `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`.\n\nMaybe the *threshold* for switching patterns isn't just `Diff > 1`? Perhaps there's a range?\n*   If Diff is \"small\" (e.g., <= 3)? -> `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]` (like Ex 3)?\n*   If Diff is \"large\" (e.g., > 3)? -> `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]` (like Ex 2)?\n*   What about Ex 1 (Diff=1)? This resulted in a 1x1 grid `[[C2]]`.\n\nLet's try a new structure based on Diff:\n\n1.  Calculate Diff = Count1 - Count2.\n2.  **Case A: Diff = 1**\n    *   Calculate Total Non-White.\n    *   If Total <= 20 (or maybe a different threshold like 15?), Output `[[C2]]`. (Fits Ex 1)\n    *   If Total > 20 (or threshold), what happens? We don't have an example for Diff=1 and large Total.\n3.  **Case B: 1 < Diff <= 3** (Maybe includes Diff=2, Diff=3)\n    *   Output `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`. (Fits Ex 3 where Diff=3)\n4.  **Case C: Diff > 3**\n    *   Output `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`. (Fits Ex 2 where Diff=5)\n\nLet's re-test this new hypothesis:\n*   **Ex 1:** Diff=1. Total=15. Fits Case A. Threshold check: 15 <= 20? Yes. Output `[[C2]]` -> `[[8]]`. **Matches.**\n*   **Ex 2:** Diff=5. Fits Case C (Diff > 3). Output `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]` -> `[[1, 1], [2, 1]]`. **Matches.**\n*   **Ex 3:** Diff=3. Fits Case B (1 < Diff <= 3). Output `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]` -> `[[5, 5], [5, 2]]`. **Matches.**\n\nThis structure seems to work for all three examples. The threshold for Case A (Diff=1) is still a bit uncertain, but <= 20 works for Ex 1. Let's tentatively use <= 15 as the threshold based on Ex 1's total, as it's the only data point. If Total > 15 when Diff=1, we'd need another example to know the output, but maybe it defaults to the Case B pattern `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`?\n\nRevised Final Logic:\n1. Count non-white pixels.\n2. If 0 non-white pixels, output `[[0]]`.\n3. If 1 unique non-white color (C1), output `[[C1]]`.\n4. If 2 or more unique non-white colors:\n    a. Find C1 (most frequent), Count1.\n    b. Find C2 (second most frequent), Count2. Handle ties appropriately (e.g., by color index as done before, though not strictly necessary based on examples).\n    c. Calculate Diff = Count1 - Count2.\n    d. **If Diff = 1:**\n        i. Calculate Total non-white pixels.\n        ii. If Total <= 15: Output `[[C2]]`.\n        iii. If Total > 15: Output `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`. (Assumption based on pattern similarity with Diff=3 case).\n    e. **If 1 < Diff <= 3:** (i.e., Diff is 2 or 3)\n        i. Output `[[C2, C2], [C2, C1]]`.\n    f. **If Diff > 3:**\n        i. Output `[[C1, C1], [C2, C1]]`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
