"""
Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-white pixel colors (colors other than 0).
Count the number of occurrences (frequency) for each unique non-white color found.
If there are no non-white colors, return a default grid (e.g., 1x1 white).
If there is only one unique non-white color (C1), create a 1x1 output grid containing C1.
If there are two or more unique non-white colors:
  Identify the color with the highest frequency (C1) and its count (Count1).
  Identify the color with the second highest frequency (C2) and its count (Count2).
  Calculate the difference: Diff = Count1 - Count2.
  If Diff is less than or equal to 1, create a 1x1 output grid containing C1.
  If Diff is greater than 1, create a 2x2 output grid with the pattern [[C1, C1], [C2, C1]].
