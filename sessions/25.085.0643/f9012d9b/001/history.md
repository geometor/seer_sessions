*   **Perception:**
    The task involves analyzing an input grid of colored pixels and producing a smaller output grid. The input grids contain various colors, including white (0), which seems to act as a background or irrelevant color. The output grid's size and content appear to depend on the frequency of the non-white colors present in the input grid. Specifically, the process involves counting the occurrences of each non-white color, identifying the most frequent (C1) and second most frequent (C2) colors, and comparing their counts. If the difference between the counts of C1 and C2 is small (1 or less, or if there's only one non-white color), the output is a 1x1 grid containing C1. If the difference is larger (greater than 1), the output is a specific 2x2 pattern composed of C1 and C2.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    elements:
      - item: input_grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors (0-9).
      - item: output_grid
        description: A smaller 2D array of pixels, either 1x1 or 2x2.
      - item: non_white_pixels
        description: Pixels in the input grid whose color value is not 0 (white).
      - item: color_frequency
        description: The count of occurrences for each non-white color in the input grid.
      - item: ranked_colors
        description: Non-white colors sorted in descending order based on their frequency.
        properties:
          - C1: The most frequent non-white color.
          - C2: The second most frequent non-white color (if it exists).
      - item: frequency_difference
        description: The absolute difference between the count of C1 and the count of C2. Calculated only if C2 exists.
    actions:
      - action: count_colors
        description: Count the occurrences of each non-white color in the input grid.
      - action: rank_colors
        description: Determine the most frequent (C1) and second most frequent (C2) non-white colors based on their counts.
      - action: determine_output_size_and_content
        description: >
          Based on the presence and frequency difference of C1 and C2, decide the output grid's dimensions and pixel values.
          - If only C1 exists, or if the frequency difference between C1 and C2 is less than or equal to 1, the output is 1x1 containing C1.
          - If the frequency difference is greater than 1, the output is 2x2 with the pattern [[C1, C1], [C2, C1]].
    relationships:
      - relationship: output_determination
        description: The output grid's size and content are determined by the frequency ranking and difference between the counts of the non-white colors in the input grid.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify all unique non-white pixel colors (colors other than 0).
    2.  Count the number of occurrences (frequency) for each unique non-white color found.
    3.  If there are no non-white colors, the output is undefined or perhaps an empty grid (based on ARC conventions, likely requires clarification, but doesn't occur in examples).
    4.  If there is only one unique non-white color (C1), create a 1x1 output grid containing that color C1.
    5.  If there are two or more unique non-white colors:
        a.  Identify the color with the highest frequency (C1) and its count (Count1).
        b.  Identify the color with the second highest frequency (C2) and its count (Count2). (Handle potential ties for C1 or C2 consistently, e.g., by color value if counts are equal, although not needed for these examples).
        c.  Calculate the difference: Diff = Count1 - Count2.
        d.  If Diff is less than or equal to 1, create a 1x1 output grid containing the most frequent color C1.
        e.  If Diff is greater than 1, create a 2x2 output grid with the following pattern:
            
```
            [[C1, C1],
             [C2, C1]]
            ```
