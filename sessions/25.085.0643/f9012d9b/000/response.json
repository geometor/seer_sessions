The input grids contain various colors, including white (0), which seems to act as a background or irrelevant color. The output grid's size and content appear to depend on the frequency of the non-white colors present in the input grid. Specifically, the process involves counting the occurrences of each non-white color, identifying the most frequent (C1) and second most frequent (C2) colors, and comparing their counts. If the difference between the counts of C1 and C2 is small (1 or less, or if there's only one non-white color), the output is a 1x1 grid containing C1. If the difference is larger (greater than 1), the output is a specific 2x2 pattern composed of C1 and C2.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
