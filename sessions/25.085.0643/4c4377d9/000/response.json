The output grid is always 6 rows high and 4 columns wide, exactly double the height of the input while maintaining the same width. The content of the output grid appears to be derived directly from the input grid. Specifically, the top half of the output grid (the first 3 rows) is a vertically flipped version of the input grid. The bottom half of the output grid (the last 3 rows) is identical to the original input grid. The colors involved change between examples (maroon/yellow, yellow/blue, green/gray, maroon/gray), but the transformation pattern remains consistent.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
