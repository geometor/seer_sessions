            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. In all provided examples, the input grid is 3x3 and the output grid is 5x5.\n2.  **Pixel Values:** The pixel values (colors) from the input grid are preserved in the output grid, but their spatial arrangement and coverage change.\n3.  **Expansion Pattern:** Observing the relationship between input and output pixels reveals a pattern of expansion.\n    *   Pixels in the corners of the input grid (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) seem to expand into 2x2 blocks in the output grid.\n    *   Pixels on the edges but not corners (e.g., top-center, bottom-center, left-center, right-center) seem to expand into 1x2 (for horizontal edges) or 2x1 (for vertical edges) blocks.\n    *   The pixel in the absolute center of the 3x3 input grid seems to map to a single 1x1 pixel in the output grid.\n4.  **Positional Dependency:** The amount and direction of expansion depend on the pixel's position within the input grid, specifically whether it lies on a boundary (first/last row or column).\n5.  **Dimension Change:** The output grid's dimensions (H', W') appear related to the input dimensions (H, W) based on this boundary expansion. For an HxW input, rows 0 and H-1 seem to contribute 2 rows each to the output height (if H>1), while other rows contribute 1 row. Similarly, columns 0 and W-1 contribute 2 columns each to the output width (if W>1), while others contribute 1 column.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Similarly, for each input column `c`, determine its horizontal scale factor: `col_factor` is 2 if `W_in > 1` and `c` is the first (0) or last (`W_in - 1`) column, otherwise `col_factor` is 1.\n3.  **Calculate Output Size:** Calculate the output grid height `H_out` by summing all `row_factors` for rows 0 to `H_in - 1`. Calculate the output grid width `W_out` by summing all `col_factors` for columns 0 to `W_in - 1`.\n4.  **Compute Offsets:** Calculate cumulative row offsets (`row_starts`) where `row_starts[r]` is the sum of `row_factors` for rows 0 to `r-1`. Calculate cumulative column offsets (`col_starts`) where `col_starts[c]` is the sum of `col_factors` for columns 0 to `c-1`.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid `output_grid` of size `H_out` x `W_out`. Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the `input_grid` with value `v`:\n    a. Retrieve the pre-calculated `row_factor` and `col_factor` for this pixel's position.\n    b. Retrieve the pre-calculated start row `R_start = row_starts[r]` and start column `C_start = col_starts[c]`.\n    c. Fill the rectangular region in `output_grid` defined by rows `R_start` to `R_start + row_factor - 1` and columns `C_start` to `C_start + col_factor - 1` with the input pixel value `v`.\n6.  **Return Output:** The completed `output_grid` is the result."
