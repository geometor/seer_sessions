- task_description: "Transform an input grid by first swapping its two constituent colors, then tiling the resulting grid in a 2x2 arrangement."
- grid_properties:
    - input_grid:
        - dimensions: Variable (H x W)
        - colors: Contains exactly two colors, one of which is always white (0).
    - output_grid:
        - dimensions: Double the input grid dimensions (2H x 2W).
        - colors: Contains the same two colors as the input grid.
        - structure: Composed of four identical quadrants arranged in a 2x2 pattern.
- transformation_steps:
    - step_1_color_identification:
        - input: input_grid
        - action: Identify the two unique colors present in the grid. Let these be C1 and C2. (Observation: C1 is always 0).
        - output: colors C1, C2
    - step_2_color_swap:
        - input: input_grid, colors C1, C2
        - action: Create an intermediate grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel has color C1, change it to C2 in the intermediate grid. If a pixel has color C2, change it to C1.
        - output: intermediate_grid
    - step_3_tiling:
        - input: intermediate_grid
        - action: Create the output grid with dimensions 2H x 2W. Copy the intermediate_grid into the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid.
        - output: output_grid
