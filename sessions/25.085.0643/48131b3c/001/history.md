*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid.
    *   Across all examples, the output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the input grid's dimensions.
    *   The content of the output grid appears to be constructed by repeating the entire input grid multiple times.
    *   Specifically, the input grid is tiled in a 2x2 arrangement to form the output grid. The top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the output grid are identical copies of the input grid.
    *   The colors and relative positions of pixels within each copied instance of the input grid remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**

    task_type: Grid Transformation
    input_attributes:
      - type: grid
      - properties:
          - height: H
          - width: W
          - content: pattern of pixels

      - type: grid
      - properties:
          - height: 2 * H
          - width: 2 * W
          - content: derived from input grid pattern
    transformation:
      - name: Tiling
      - description: The input grid is used as a tile to create the output grid.
      - parameters:
          - tile_pattern: The entire input grid.
          - arrangement: 2x2 grid of tiles.
      - details:
          - The output grid is composed of four identical copies of the input grid.
          - Copy 1 (Top-Left): Placed at output coordinates (0, 0).
          - Copy 2 (Top-Right): Placed at output coordinates (0, W).
          - Copy 3 (Bottom-Left): Placed at output coordinates (H, 0).
          - Copy 4 (Bottom-Right): Placed at output coordinates (H, W).
    relationships:
      - The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
      - The output grid is a composite structure formed by repeating the input grid.
    invariants:
      - The pixel colors and their relative arrangement within the repeated input pattern are preserved.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Get the input grid.
    2.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    3.  Create a new output grid with height 2\*H and width 2\*W.
    4.  Copy the input grid to the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    5.  Copy the input grid to the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2\*W-1).
    6.  Copy the input grid to the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2\*H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    7.  Copy the input grid to the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2\*H-1, columns W to 2\*W-1).
    8.  Return the resulting output grid.
