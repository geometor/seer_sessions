task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - dimensions: Both input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    - height: The height of the input grid is even (10 in the examples).
    - width: The width is consistent between input and output (4 in the examples).
  relevant_input_region:
    - name: bottom_half
    - definition: The rows from index `height / 2` to `height - 1`.
    - content: Contains all non-background pixels in the input.
  output_structure:
    - top_half: Rows from index 0 to `height / 2 - 1`.
    - bottom_half: Rows from index `height / 2` to `height - 1`.

  relationships:
    - output_grid.bottom_half is identical to input_grid.bottom_half.
    - output_grid.top_half is a vertically flipped version of input_grid.bottom_half.
    - output_grid exhibits vertical symmetry across its horizontal midpoint.
