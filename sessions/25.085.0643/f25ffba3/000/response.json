The top half (rows 0 through 4) is entirely white.\n3.  **Input vs. Output Structure:**\n    *   The bottom half of the output grid (rows 5-9) appears to be an exact copy of the bottom half of the input grid (rows 5-9).\n    *   The top half of the output grid (rows 0-4) seems related to the bottom half of the input grid. Comparing input row 9 with output row 0, input row 8 with output row 1, and so on, reveals that the top half of the output grid is a vertically flipped version of the bottom half of the input grid.\n4.  **Symmetry:** The output grid exhibits vertical symmetry around the horizontal line between row 4 and row 5. The top half is a mirror image (flipped vertically) of the bottom half.\n5.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation seems to involve isolating the bottom half of the input grid, copying it to the bottom half of the output grid, and copying a vertically flipped version of it to the top half of the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
