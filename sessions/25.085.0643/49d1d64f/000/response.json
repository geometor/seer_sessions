Specifically, the output grid has 2 more rows and 2 more columns than the input grid.\n    *   Example 1: Input 2x3 -> Output 4x5 (Height +2, Width +2)\n    *   Example 2: Input 2x2 -> Output 4x4 (Height +2, Width +2)\n    *   Example 3: Input 3x3 -> Output 5x5 (Height +2, Width +2)\n3.  **Core Structure Preservation:** The central part of the output grid seems to contain modified or duplicated elements from the input grid.\n4.  **Padding/Border:** The extra rows and columns in the output act as a border or padding around a central structure derived from the input.\n5.  **Row-wise Operations:** The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis.\n    *   Each row `i` (from 0 to H-1) in the input grid corresponds to row `i+1` in the output grid.\n    *   Output row `i+1` is constructed by taking input row `i`, prepending its first element, and appending its last element.\n    *   The first row (row 0) of the output grid is constructed by taking the *first* row of the input grid and padding it left and right with the white color (0).\n    *   The last row (row H+1) of the output grid is constructed by taking the *last* row of the input grid and padding it left and right with the white color (0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
