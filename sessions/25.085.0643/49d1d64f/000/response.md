Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are rectangular grids of pixels represented by numbers 0-9 (colors).
2.  **Dimensionality Change:** The output grid is always larger than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has 2 more rows and 2 more columns than the input grid.
    *   Example 1: Input 2x3 -> Output 4x5 (Height +2, Width +2)
    *   Example 2: Input 2x2 -> Output 4x4 (Height +2, Width +2)
    *   Example 3: Input 3x3 -> Output 5x5 (Height +2, Width +2)
3.  **Core Structure Preservation:** The central part of the output grid seems to contain modified or duplicated elements from the input grid.
4.  **Padding/Border:** The extra rows and columns in the output act as a border or padding around a central structure derived from the input.
5.  **Row-wise Operations:** The transformation appears to operate on a row-by-row basis.
    *   Each row `i` (from 0 to H-1) in the input grid corresponds to row `i+1` in the output grid.
    *   Output row `i+1` is constructed by taking input row `i`, prepending its first element, and appending its last element.
    *   The first row (row 0) of the output grid is constructed by taking the *first* row of the input grid and padding it left and right with the white color (0).
    *   The last row (row H+1) of the output grid is constructed by taking the *last* row of the input grid and padding it left and right with the white color (0).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Add specific padding to create a larger grid.
grid_properties:
  input_height: H
  input_width: W
  output_height: H + 2
  output_width: W + 2
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
  - type: row
    description: Each row of the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: containment
    parent: output_grid
    child: modified versions of input grid rows
transformations:
  - action: create_intermediate_rows
    input: each row `R` from input_grid (index `i`, 0 <= i < H)
    output: new row `R'`
    rule: R' = [R[0]] + R + [R[W-1]]
    placement: These R' rows form rows 1 to H of the output_grid. (output_grid[i+1] = R')
  - action: create_top_border_row
    input: first row `R0` of input_grid
    output: new row `T`
    rule: T = [0] + R0 + [0] (where 0 represents the white color)
    placement: T forms row 0 of the output_grid.
  - action: create_bottom_border_row
    input: last row `RH_minus_1` of input_grid
    output: new row `B`
    rule: B = [0] + RH_minus_1 + [0] (where 0 represents the white color)
    placement: B forms row H+1 of the output_grid.
  - action: assemble_output
    components:
      - top_border_row `T`
      - intermediate_rows `R'` (stacked)
      - bottom_border_row `B`
    order: T, stacked R', B
    output: final output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Given an input grid of height H and width W.
2.  Create a new output grid with height H+2 and width W+2.
3.  Construct the first row (row 0) of the output grid: Take the first row of the input grid, place a white pixel (0) before it, and place a white pixel (0) after it.
4.  Construct the last row (row H+1) of the output grid: Take the last row (row H-1) of the input grid, place a white pixel (0) before it, and place a white pixel (0) after it.
5.  For each row `i` from 0 to H-1 in the input grid:
    a.  Identify the pixel value at the start (first column) of input row `i`.
    b.  Identify the pixel value at the end (last column) of input row `i`.
    c.  Construct the corresponding row `i+1` in the output grid by taking the input row `i`, placing the identified starting pixel value before it, and placing the identified ending pixel value after it.
6.  The assembled output grid is the result.
