Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example takes a smaller rectangular grid as input and produces a larger rectangular grid as output.
2.  **Dimensions:** In all examples, the output grid's height is exactly double the input grid's height, and the output grid's width is exactly double the input grid's width.
3.  **Content Preservation/Transformation:** The colors present in the input grid are the only colors present in the output grid. The arrangement, however, is changed and expanded.
4.  **Symmetry:** The output grids exhibit symmetry. If you draw a line down the middle vertically and horizontally, the quadrants appear to be reflections of each other or the original input.
5.  **Quadrant Analysis:**
    *   The top-left quadrant of the output grid appears identical to the input grid.
    *   The top-right quadrant appears to be a mirror image (horizontal reflection) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant appears to be an upside-down mirror image (vertical reflection) of the input grid.
    *   The bottom-right quadrant appears to be a mirror image of the bottom-left quadrant (horizontal reflection of a vertical reflection) or an upside-down mirror image of the top-right quadrant (vertical reflection of a horizontal reflection). This is equivalent to rotating the input grid 180 degrees or reflecting it both vertically and horizontally.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - type: 2D grid
  - variable_size: yes (height H, width W)
  - variable_colors: yes (uses white and one other color per example)
output_properties:
  - type: 2D grid
  - size: fixed relative to input (height 2H, width 2W)
  - content: derived from input grid colors
relationships:
  - output_grid_size: [2 * input_height, 2 * input_width]
actions:
  - identify: input grid (I)
  - generate: output grid (O) of size 2H x 2W
  - copy: I to the top-left quadrant of O (rows 0 to H-1, cols 0 to W-1)
  - reflect_horizontal: I to create R_h
  - copy: R_h to the top-right quadrant of O (rows 0 to H-1, cols W to 2W-1)
  - reflect_vertical: I to create R_v
  - copy: R_v to the bottom-left quadrant of O (rows H to 2H-1, cols 0 to W-1)
  - reflect_horizontal: R_v to create R_hv (or reflect_vertical R_h)
  - copy: R_hv to the bottom-right quadrant of O (rows H to 2H-1, cols W to 2W-1)
resulting_pattern:
  - The output grid is composed of four tiles arranged 2x2.
  - Tile_TopLeft: Input grid
  - Tile_TopRight: Input grid reflected horizontally
  - Tile_BottomLeft: Input grid reflected vertically
  - Tile_BottomRight: Input grid reflected horizontally and vertically
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 2H and width 2W.
3.  Copy the original input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
4.  Create a horizontally reflected version of the input grid. Copy this reflected grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
5.  Create a vertically reflected version of the input grid. Copy this reflected grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
6.  Create a version of the input grid that is reflected both horizontally and vertically (or rotate the input 180 degrees). Copy this doubly reflected grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
