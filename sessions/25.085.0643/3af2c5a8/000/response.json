The arrangement, however, is changed and expanded.\n4.  **Symmetry:** The output grids exhibit symmetry. If you draw a line down the middle vertically and horizontally, the quadrants appear to be reflections of each other or the original input.\n5.  **Quadrant Analysis:**\n    *   The top-left quadrant of the output grid appears identical to the input grid.\n    *   The top-right quadrant appears to be a mirror image (horizontal reflection) of the input grid.\n    *   The bottom-left quadrant appears to be an upside-down mirror image (vertical reflection) of the input grid.\n    *   The bottom-right quadrant appears to be a mirror image of the bottom-left quadrant (horizontal reflection of a vertical reflection) or an upside-down mirror image of the top-right quadrant (vertical reflection of a horizontal reflection). This is equivalent to rotating the input grid 180 degrees or reflecting it both vertically and horizontally.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
