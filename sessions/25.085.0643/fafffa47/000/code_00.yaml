Task: Superposition Comparison

Input:
  - type: grid
  - height: 6
  - width: 3
  - colors: [white(0), blue(1), maroon(9)] # Primarily
  - structure: Composed of two vertical 3x3 subgrids.
    - subgrid_1: Top half (rows 0-2)
    - subgrid_2: Bottom half (rows 3-5)

Output:
  - type: grid
  - height: 3
  - width: 3
  - colors: [white(0), red(2)]

Transformation: Pixel-wise Comparison
  - rule: Compare corresponding pixels from the top and bottom input subgrids.
  - condition: If a pixel at `(r, c)` in the top subgrid AND the pixel at `(r, c)` in the bottom subgrid are both white(0).
  - result_true: The output pixel at `(r, c)` is red(2).
  - result_false: The output pixel at `(r, c)` is white(0).
