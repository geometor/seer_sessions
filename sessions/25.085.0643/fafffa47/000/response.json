The output grids are consistently 3 rows by 3 columns.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and maroon (9). White appears as the background or default color in the output. Red appears selectively in the output. Blue and maroon appear only in the input.\n3.  **Input Division:** The input grid appears to be conceptually divided into two 3x3 sections: the top half (rows 0-2) and the bottom half (rows 3-5).\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be generated by comparing corresponding cells between the top and bottom halves of the input grid.\n5.  **Rule Identification:** Observing the examples, a consistent pattern emerges: a cell in the output grid becomes red (2) if and only if the corresponding cell in the *top* half of the input grid AND the corresponding cell in the *bottom* half of the input grid are *both* white (0). Otherwise, the output cell is white (0).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Get the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the top input grid.\n    b.  Get the color of the cell at `(row + 3, column)` in the input grid (which corresponds to position `(row, column)` in the conceptual bottom input grid).\n    c.  Check if the color from step 4a is white (0) AND the color from step 4b is also white (0).\n    d.  If both conditions in step 4c are true, set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to red (2).\n    e.  Otherwise (if either or both are not white), leave the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid as white (0).\n5.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid."
