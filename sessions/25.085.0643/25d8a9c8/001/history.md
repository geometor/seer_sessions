*   **Perception:**
    *   The task takes a 3x3 grid as input and produces a 3x3 grid as output.
    *   The input grids contain various colors.
    *   The output grids only contain white (0) and gray (5).
    *   The transformation appears to operate independently on each row of the input grid.
    *   Looking at each row in the examples, there seems to be a condition based on the colors within that row.
    *   If all pixels in an input row share the same color, the corresponding output row is filled entirely with gray (5).
    *   If an input row contains pixels of different colors, the corresponding output row is filled entirely with white (0).

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_context:
      grid_size_input: 3x3
      grid_size_output: 3x3
      input_colors: variable (red, maroon, yellow, orange, green, magenta, blue observed)
      output_colors: white (0), gray (5)
      transformation_scope: row-based

    objects:
      - object: row
        properties:
          - pixels: sequence of color values in the row
          - unique_colors_count: the number of distinct color values in the row

    actions:
      - action: analyze_row_colors
        input: input_row (object: row)
        output: unique_colors_count (property of row)
      - action: transform_row
        input: input_row (object: row)
        output: output_row (object: row)
        condition: based on the unique_colors_count of the input_row

    relationships:
      - relationship: row_transformation_rule
        based_on: input_row.unique_colors_count
        rule: |
          if input_row.unique_colors_count == 1:
            output_row.pixels = all gray (5)
          else (if input_row.unique_colors_count > 1):
            output_row.pixels = all white (0)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    3.  For the current input row, determine if all pixels in that row have the same color value.
    4.  If all pixels in the input row have the same color, set all pixels in the corresponding row of the output grid to gray (5).
    5.  If the pixels in the input row have different colors (i.e., more than one unique color), set all pixels in the corresponding row of the output grid to white (0).
    6.  Return the completed output grid.
