"""
Transforms an input grid based on the uniformity of colors within each row.

Iterates through each row of the input grid. If all pixels in a row share the 
same color, the corresponding row in the output grid is filled with gray (5). 
If a row contains pixels of different colors, the corresponding output row is 
filled with white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
