task_description: Downsample a 6x6 grid to a 3x3 grid by selecting the non-white pixel from each 2x2 block.

grid_properties:
  - input_grid_size:
      height: 6
      width: 6
  - output_grid_size:
      height: 3
      width: 3
  - color_palette: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8] # Colors observed in examples (0 is white)

objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color_value: Integer (0-9)
      - is_white: Boolean (true if value is 0)
  - object_type: block
    definition: A 2x2 contiguous group of pixels in the input grid.
    relationship_to_output: Each 2x2 block in the input corresponds to a single pixel in the output.

transformation:
  type: downsampling
  method: block_sampling
  block_size: 2x2
  rule:
    - For each 2x2 block in the input grid (starting from the top-left, moving row by row):
      - Find all non-white pixels within the block.
      - If exactly one non-white pixel exists:
          - The corresponding output pixel takes the color value of that non-white pixel.
      - If zero non-white pixels exist (all pixels are white):
          - The corresponding output pixel takes the value 0 (white).
    - Assumption: Each 2x2 block contains at most one non-white pixel.

relationship_between_grids:
  - The output grid is a scaled-down representation of the input grid.
  - Output pixel at (row_out, col_out) corresponds to the input 2x2 block starting at (row_out * 2, col_out * 2).
