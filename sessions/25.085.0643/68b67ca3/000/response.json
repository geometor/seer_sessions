This suggests a downscaling or sampling operation where the output grid is exactly half the height and half the width of the input grid.\n2.  **Pixel Values:** Both input and output grids contain colored pixels (values 1-9) and white pixels (value 0).\n3.  **Pixel Distribution:** In the input grids, non-white pixels appear sparsely. There seems to be at most one non-white pixel within any 2x2 region corresponding to an output pixel.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to represent the non-white pixels found within corresponding 2x2 blocks of the input grid. If a 2x2 block in the input contains only white pixels, the corresponding output pixel is also white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
