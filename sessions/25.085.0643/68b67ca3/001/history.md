Okay, let's break down the transformation in this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grid Sizes:** All input grids are 6x6, and all output grids are 3x3. This suggests a downscaling or sampling operation where the output grid is exactly half the height and half the width of the input grid.
2.  **Pixel Values:** Both input and output grids contain colored pixels (values 1-9) and white pixels (value 0).
3.  **Pixel Distribution:** In the input grids, non-white pixels appear sparsely. There seems to be at most one non-white pixel within any 2x2 region corresponding to an output pixel.
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid appears to represent the non-white pixels found within corresponding 2x2 blocks of the input grid. If a 2x2 block in the input contains only white pixels, the corresponding output pixel is also white.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Downsample a 6x6 grid to a 3x3 grid by selecting the non-white pixel from each 2x2 block.

grid_properties:
  - input_grid_size:
      height: 6
      width: 6
  - output_grid_size:
      height: 3
      width: 3
  - color_palette: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8] # Colors observed in examples (0 is white)

objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color_value: Integer (0-9)
      - is_white: Boolean (true if value is 0)
  - object_type: block
    definition: A 2x2 contiguous group of pixels in the input grid.
    relationship_to_output: Each 2x2 block in the input corresponds to a single pixel in the output.

transformation:
  type: downsampling
  method: block_sampling
  block_size: 2x2
  rule:
    - For each 2x2 block in the input grid (starting from the top-left, moving row by row):
      - Find all non-white pixels within the block.
      - If exactly one non-white pixel exists:
          - The corresponding output pixel takes the color value of that non-white pixel.
      - If zero non-white pixels exist (all pixels are white):
          - The corresponding output pixel takes the value 0 (white).
    - Assumption: Each 2x2 block contains at most one non-white pixel.

relationship_between_grids:
  - The output grid is a scaled-down representation of the input grid.
  - Output pixel at (row_out, col_out) corresponds to the input 2x2 block starting at (row_out * 2, col_out * 2).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
2.  Iterate through the 6x6 input grid using 2x2 blocks. The blocks cover indices (0:2, 0:2), (0:2, 2:4), (0:2, 4:6), (2:4, 0:2), (2:4, 2:4), (2:4, 4:6), (4:6, 0:2), (4:6, 2:4), (4:6, 4:6).
3.  For each 2x2 block:
    a.  Examine the four pixels within the block.
    b.  Identify if any pixel has a non-white value (a value other than 0).
    c.  If a non-white pixel is found, assign its value to the corresponding pixel in the output grid. The output grid coordinates (row_out, col_out) are calculated as (row_in // 2, col_in // 2), where (row_in, col_in) are the top-left coordinates of the 2x2 block in the input grid.
    d.  If all four pixels in the 2x2 block are white (0), the corresponding pixel in the output grid remains white (0).
4.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
