Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Each example takes a square grid (3x3 in these cases) as input and produces a larger square grid (6x6) as output. The output grid's dimensions are consistently double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.
2.  **Output Composition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by combining four modified versions of the input grid, arranged in a 2x2 tiling pattern.
3.  **Transformation Identification:** By comparing the input grid to each of the four 3x3 quadrants within the 6x6 output grid, we can identify the transformations:
    *   The top-left quadrant of the output is identical to the input grid.
    *   The top-right quadrant is the input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The bottom-left quadrant is the input grid rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise).
    *   The bottom-right quadrant is the input grid rotated 180 degrees.
4.  **Consistency:** This pattern of arranging four rotations (0, 90, 270, 180 degrees clockwise) holds true for all three provided training examples.

**YAML Facts:**
