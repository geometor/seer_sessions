Identify 3x3 subgrids within the input grid. The subgrids are arranged 
horizontally if the input width is greater than its height, and vertically if the 
input height is greater than its width. If the input is square (3x3), it is 
treated as a single subgrid. Count the number of non-white (non-zero) pixels 
in each 3x3 subgrid. Select the subgrid that contains the maximum number of 
non-white pixels. If there's a tie, the first subgrid encountered (left-to-right 
or top-to-bottom) with the maximum count is chosen. The output grid is a copy 
of the selected 3x3 subgrid.
