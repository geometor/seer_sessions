These subgrids seem to be consistently 3x3 in all provided examples.\n2.  **Arrangement:** The 3x3 subgrids are arranged either horizontally (side-by-side) when the input grid is wider than it is tall (Examples 1, 2) or vertically (stacked) when the input grid is taller than it is wide (Examples 3, 4).\n3.  **Subgrid Content:** Each 3x3 subgrid contains a pattern made of a single color against a white background (color 0).\n4.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a single 3x3 grid.\n5.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The output grid is consistently identical to one of the 3x3 subgrids present in the input grid.\n6.  **Selection Criterion:** By comparing the subgrids within each input, the subgrid chosen for the output appears to be the one containing the largest number of non-white pixels.\n    *   Example 1: Yellow (6 non-white pixels) is chosen over Green (4), Red (4), Azure (4), Blue (4).\n    *   Example 2: Orange (5 non-white pixels) is chosen over Red (4), Green (4), Blue (4).\n    *   Example 3: Orange (5 non-white pixels) is chosen over Green (4), Red (4), Azure (4).\n    *   Example 4: Azure (8 non-white pixels) is chosen over Magenta (5), Yellow (5).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Determine the size N of the square subgrids by taking the minimum of H and W (N = min(H, W)). In the examples, N is always 3.\n3.  Identify the arrangement of subgrids:\n    *   If W > H, the subgrids are arranged horizontally. The number of subgrids is W / N. Iterate through them from left to right (columns 0 to N-1, N to 2N-1, etc.).\n    *   If H > W, the subgrids are arranged vertically. The number of subgrids is H / N. Iterate through them from top to bottom (rows 0 to N-1, N to 2N-1, etc.).\n    *   If H = W, the input itself is the only subgrid.\n4.  Initialize a variable `max_count` to -1 and a variable `selected_subgrid` to null.\n5.  For each subgrid identified in step 3:\n    a.  Count the number of pixels within the subgrid that have a color value other than 0 (white). Let this be `current_count`.\n    b.  Compare `current_count` with `max_count`.\n    c.  If `current_count` is greater than `max_count`, update `max_count` to `current_count` and update `selected_subgrid` to be a copy of the current subgrid.\n6.  The final output grid is the `selected_subgrid`."
