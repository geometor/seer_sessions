task_description: Select a subgrid based on pixel count.
grid_properties:
  input_grid_dimensions: variable height and width (HxW)
  output_grid_dimensions: fixed 3x3 (NxN where N=3)

subgrid_decomposition:
  present: true
  subgrid_size: NxN, where N = min(input_height, input_width) (N=3 in examples)
  arrangement:
    type: conditional
    condition_1:
      if: input_width > input_height
      then: horizontal tiling
      count: input_width / N
    condition_2:
      if: input_height > input_width
      then: vertical tiling
      count: input_height / N
    condition_3:
      if: input_height == input_width
      then: single subgrid (input is the subgrid)
      count: 1

selection_rule:
  target: one subgrid from the input decomposition
  criterion:
    metric: count of non-white (non-zero) pixels within each subgrid
    rule: select the subgrid with the maximum count
  tie_breaking: (not explicitly needed for examples, but assumed) select the first subgrid encountered (left-to-right for horizontal, top-to-bottom for vertical) with the maximum count.

output_generation:
  action: copy
  source: the selected subgrid
  destination: the output grid
