Input Grid:
  - Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - Size: Variable height (H) and width (W)

Output Grid:
  - Type: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - Size: Fixed relationship to input size - Height = 2 * H, Width = 2 * W

Transformation:
  - Type: Scaling / Expansion
  - Operation: Each pixel at position (r, c) in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  - Mapping:
    - Input pixel at (r, c) with color X maps to:
      - Output pixel at (2*r, 2*c) with color X
      - Output pixel at (2*r+1, 2*c) with color X
      - Output pixel at (2*r, 2*c+1) with color X
      - Output pixel at (2*r+1, 2*c+1) with color X
  - Objects: Individual pixels are treated as units.
  - Properties: The color of each pixel is preserved during expansion.
  - Relationships: The spatial relationship between adjacent pixels in the input is maintained in the output through the adjacency of the corresponding 2x2 blocks.
