In all provided examples, the output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double those of the input grid. Observing the color patterns, each individual pixel (cell) in the input grid appears to be expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. The relative positions of these expanded blocks correspond to the relative positions of the original pixels.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
