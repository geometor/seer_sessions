Divide the 9x3 input grid vertically into three 3x3 subgrids: Top (rows 0-2), Middle (rows 3-5), and Bottom (rows 6-8).\n2. For each 3x3 subgrid:\n   a. Identify the two colors present.\n   b. Determine the minority color (the color that appears fewer times).\n   c. Count the number of connected components formed by pixels of the minority color. Consider pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (4-way adjacency).\n3. Compare the number of minority components calculated for each of the three subgrids.\n4. Select the subgrid that has the *minimum* number of minority components.\n5. If two or three subgrids have the same minimum number of minority components, apply a tie-breaker: select the subgrid (among those tied) whose minority color has the highest numerical value.\n6.
