  Derivation: Copy of one Input Subgrid (Top, Middle, or Bottom)

TransformationRule:
  Action: Select one Subgrid from InputGrid based on criteria.
  Criteria:
    Primary: Maximum number of connected components formed by the Minority Color within the Subgrid.
    TieBreaker:
      Condition: Multiple Subgrids share the same maximum number of Minority Color components.
      Rule: Select the Subgrid (among those tied) whose Minority Color has the highest numerical value.

Definitions:
  Minority Color: The color with the fewest pixels within a 3x3 Subgrid.
  Connected Component: A group of one or more pixels of the same color where each pixel is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one other pixel in the group.
