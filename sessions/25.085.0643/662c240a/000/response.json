            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9 rows by 3 columns. The output grids are consistently 3 rows by 3 columns.\n2.  **Input Composition:** Each 9x3 input grid can be visually divided into three stacked 3x3 subgrids. Let's call them Top (rows 0-2), Middle (rows 3-5), and Bottom (rows 6-8).\n3.  **Transformation Goal:** The output grid is always identical to one of these three 3x3 subgrids from the input. The task is to determine the rule for selecting *which* subgrid becomes the output.\n4.  **Subgrid Properties:** Each 3x3 subgrid in the examples contains exactly two distinct colors. One color appears more frequently (majority color), and the other appears less frequently (minority color).\n5.  **Identifying the Rule:**\n    *   I examined properties like the colors present, the count of unique colors, the sum of pixel values, and counts of majority/minority pixels within each subgrid, but these didn't yield a consistent selection rule on their own.\n    *   I then considered the *connected components* (objects) formed by the *minority* color within each 3x3 subgrid. Adjacent pixels of the same color (up, down, left, right) form a component.\n    *   Calculating the number of minority color components for each subgrid revealed a pattern: The subgrid with the *maximum* number of minority components is typically selected.\n        *   `train_1`: Counts (Top=2, Middle=2, Bottom=3) -> Select Bottom (Max=3)\n        *   `train_2`: Counts (Top=2, Middle=3, Bottom=1) -> Select Middle (Max=3)\n    *   **Tie-breaking:** In cases where multiple subgrids have the same maximum number of minority components, a tie-breaker is needed.\n        *   `train_3`: Counts (Top=2, Middle=2, Bottom=1). Max=2. Tie between Top and Middle. Top is selected. Minority colors are Azure(8) for Top and Blue(1) for Middle. 8 > 1.\n        *   `train_4`: Counts (Top=1, Middle=2, Bottom=2). Max=2. Tie between Middle and Bottom. Bottom is selected. Minority colors are Blue(1) for Middle and Green(3) for Bottom. 3 > 1.\n    *   The tie-breaking rule appears to be: If there's a tie in the maximum number of minority components, select the subgrid among the tied ones whose minority color has the highest numerical value.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
