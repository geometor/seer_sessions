Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are 3x3, and the corresponding output grids are 6x6. This suggests the output grid dimensions might be double the input grid dimensions.
2.  **Content Mapping:** The non-white pixels from the input grid appear in the output grid, but not just in their original positions.
3.  **Pattern:** Each non-white pixel in the input seems to initiate a diagonal "streak" or "trail" extending downwards and to the right in the output grid.
    *   In `train_1`, the yellow pixel at input (0, 1) creates yellow pixels at output (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).
    *   The azure pixel at input (1, 1) creates azure pixels at output (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).
    *   The red pixel at input (2, 0) creates red pixels at output (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3).
4.  **Extent of Streaks:** The streaks continue as long as they remain within the bounds of the 6x6 output grid.
5.  **Background:** The output grid is initialized with the background color (white, 0), and only the cells covered by the diagonal streaks are changed.
6.  **Overlapping:** In the provided examples, the diagonal streaks originating from different input pixels do not seem to overlap or overwrite each other.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - description: A small grid (e.g., 3x3) containing colored pixels (objects) and a background color (white, 0).
  - objects: Non-white pixels at specific coordinates (r, c).
output_properties:
  - description: A larger grid where dimensions are double the input dimensions (e.g., 6x6 for a 3x3 input).
  - background: Initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - content: Contains diagonal streaks of color originating from the positions corresponding to the input objects.
transformation:
  - name: Diagonal Propagation
  - description: Each non-white pixel from the input grid is propagated diagonally down and to the right in the output grid.
  - steps:
      1: Determine output grid size (2 * InputHeight, 2 * InputWidth).
      2: Initialize output grid with background color.
      3: For each non-white pixel C at input coordinates (r, c):
          a: Iterate k starting from 0.
          b: Calculate target coordinates (target_r = r + k, target_c = c + k).
          c: If target coordinates are within output grid bounds:
              i: Set output grid cell (target_r, target_c) to color C.
          d: Else (target coordinates out of bounds):
              i: Stop propagation for this input pixel.
          e: Increment k.
relationships:
  - Input pixel at (r, c) influences output pixels at (r+k, c+k).
  - Output grid dimensions are directly derived from input grid dimensions (OutputDim = 2 * InputDim).
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input grid and determine its height (H) and width (W).
2.  Calculate the dimensions for the output grid: `OutputHeight = 2 * H` and `OutputWidth = 2 * W`.
3.  Create a new output grid of size `OutputHeight` by `OutputWidth` and fill it completely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Go through each cell in the input grid, row by row (`r` from 0 to H-1), column by column (`c` from 0 to W-1).
5.  Identify the color `C` at the current input cell `(r, c)`.
6.  If the color `C` is not the background color (white, 0):
    a.  Start a counter `k` at 0.
    b.  Begin a loop:
        i.  Calculate the target row `target_r = r + k`.
        ii. Calculate the target column `target_c = c + k`.
        iii. Check if `target_r` is less than `OutputHeight` AND `target_c` is less than `OutputWidth`.
        iv. If both conditions are true (the target cell is within the output grid bounds), set the color of the output grid cell at `(target_r, target_c)` to `C`.
        v. If either condition is false (the target cell is outside the output grid bounds), stop this inner loop (for the current `k` and color `C`).
        vi. Increase the counter `k` by 1 and continue the loop.
7.  After checking all input cells, the output grid is complete. Return the output grid.
