This suggests the output grid dimensions might be double the input grid dimensions.\n2.  **Content Mapping:** The non-white pixels from the input grid appear in the output grid, but not just in their original positions.\n3.  **Pattern:** Each non-white pixel in the input seems to initiate a diagonal \"streak\" or \"trail\" extending downwards and to the right in the output grid.\n    *   In `train_1`, the yellow pixel at input (0, 1) creates yellow pixels at output (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).\n    *   The azure pixel at input (1, 1) creates azure pixels at output (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).\n    *   The red pixel at input (2, 0) creates red pixels at output (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3).\n4.  **Extent of Streaks:** The streaks continue as long as they remain within the bounds of the 6x6 output grid.\n5.  **Background:** The output grid is initialized with the background color (white, 0), and only the cells covered by the diagonal streaks are changed.\n6.  **Overlapping:** In the provided examples, the diagonal streaks originating from different input pixels do not seem to overlap or overwrite each other.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
