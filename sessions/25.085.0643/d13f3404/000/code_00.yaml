task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - description: A small grid (e.g., 3x3) containing colored pixels (objects) and a background color (white, 0).
  - objects: Non-white pixels at specific coordinates (r, c).
output_properties:
  - description: A larger grid where dimensions are double the input dimensions (e.g., 6x6 for a 3x3 input).
  - background: Initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
  - content: Contains diagonal streaks of color originating from the positions corresponding to the input objects.
transformation:
  - name: Diagonal Propagation
  - description: Each non-white pixel from the input grid is propagated diagonally down and to the right in the output grid.
  - steps:
      1: Determine output grid size (2 * InputHeight, 2 * InputWidth).
      2: Initialize output grid with background color.
      3: For each non-white pixel C at input coordinates (r, c):
          a: Iterate k starting from 0.
          b: Calculate target coordinates (target_r = r + k, target_c = c + k).
          c: If target coordinates are within output grid bounds:
              i: Set output grid cell (target_r, target_c) to color C.
          d: Else (target coordinates out of bounds):
              i: Stop propagation for this input pixel.
          e: Increment k.
relationships:
  - Input pixel at (r, c) influences output pixels at (r+k, c+k).
  - Output grid dimensions are directly derived from input grid dimensions (OutputDim = 2 * InputDim).
