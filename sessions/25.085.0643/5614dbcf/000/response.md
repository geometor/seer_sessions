Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input grids are 9x9, and both output grids are 3x3. This strongly suggests the input grid is treated as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 subgrids.
2.  **Input-Output Mapping**: Each cell in the 3x3 output grid corresponds spatially to one of the 3x3 subgrids in the input grid. The top-left output cell corresponds to the top-left 3x3 input subgrid, the top-middle output cell to the top-middle 3x3 input subgrid, and so on.
3.  **Color Significance**: The core task seems to be determining the single color value for each output cell based on the colors present within the corresponding 3x3 input subgrid.
4.  **Dominant Color**: Within each 3x3 subgrid of the input, there's often a prominent color (other than white) forming a shape or block (e.g., red 'T' in train_1, green block in train_2).
5.  **Role of Gray (5)**: Gray pixels appear in several input subgrids. Sometimes they replace a pixel within a colored shape (e.g., orange block in train_1, azure block in train_2), other times they appear alone in an otherwise white subgrid.
6.  **Transformation Logic**: The color of an output cell appears to be the dominant non-white, non-gray color found within the corresponding 3x3 input subgrid. If a subgrid contains *only* white and/or gray pixels, the corresponding output cell is white. The presence of a gray pixel within a subgrid that *also* contains another significant color (like red, orange, green, etc.) does *not* change the output color derived from that significant color.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Determine the color for each cell in a 3x3 output grid based on the contents of corresponding 3x3 subgrids within a 9x9 input grid.

input_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 9
    width: 9
    structure: Composed of nine 3x3 subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
  elements:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        color: Integer from 0 to 9.
    - type: Subgrid
      properties:
        height: 3
        width: 3
        location: Defined by its top-left corner coordinates (row, col) where row, col are multiples of 3 (0, 3, 6).
      contains:
        - type: Pixel

output_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3
  elements:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        color: Integer from 0 to 9.

relationships:
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each cell (R, C) in the output grid corresponds to the input subgrid located at rows R*3 to R*3+2 and columns C*3 to C*3+2.
  - type: Color Determination
    description: The color of an output cell is determined by the colors present within its corresponding input subgrid.

transformation:
  - action: Identify Dominant Color
    input: 3x3 subgrid from the input grid
    output: A single color value (or white if no dominant color)
    logic: Find the color within the subgrid that is not white (0) and not gray (5). If multiple such colors exist, this rule might need refinement (though not observed in examples). If only white (0) and/or gray (5) pixels are present, the result is white (0).
  - action: Assign Color
    input: Dominant color determined for a subgrid
    output: The corresponding cell in the output grid is set to this color.

constants:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: special_color
    value: 5 (gray)
    role: Ignored when determining the dominant color unless it's the only non-white color present.

examples_summary:
  - train_1: Subgrids containing red or orange (even with gray present) map to red or orange respectively. Subgrids containing only white and/or gray map to white.
  - train_2: Subgrids containing green, azure, orange, magenta, or maroon (even with gray present) map to their respective colors. Subgrids containing only white and/or gray map to white.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Divide the 9x9 input grid into a 3x3 arrangement of non-overlapping 3x3 subgrids.
2.  Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially empty or filled with a default color (e.g., white).
3.  For each 3x3 subgrid in the input grid, examine all the pixels within it.
4.  Identify if there is any pixel color within the subgrid that is *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5).
5.  If such a color is found, assign that color to the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid. (Note: The examples only show one such non-white, non-gray color per relevant subgrid. If multiple were possible, a tie-breaking rule would be needed, e.g., most frequent).
6.  If no such color is found (meaning the subgrid contains only white (0) and/or gray (5) pixels), assign white (0) to the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid.
7.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
