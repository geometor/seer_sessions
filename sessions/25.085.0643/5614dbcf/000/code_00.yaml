task_description: Determine the color for each cell in a 3x3 output grid based on the contents of corresponding 3x3 subgrids within a 9x9 input grid.

input_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 9
    width: 9
    structure: Composed of nine 3x3 subgrids arranged in a 3x3 pattern.
  elements:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        color: Integer from 0 to 9.
    - type: Subgrid
      properties:
        height: 3
        width: 3
        location: Defined by its top-left corner coordinates (row, col) where row, col are multiples of 3 (0, 3, 6).
      contains:
        - type: Pixel

output_grid:
  type: Grid
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3
  elements:
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        color: Integer from 0 to 9.

relationships:
  - type: Mapping
    description: Each cell (R, C) in the output grid corresponds to the input subgrid located at rows R*3 to R*3+2 and columns C*3 to C*3+2.
  - type: Color Determination
    description: The color of an output cell is determined by the colors present within its corresponding input subgrid.

transformation:
  - action: Identify Dominant Color
    input: 3x3 subgrid from the input grid
    output: A single color value (or white if no dominant color)
    logic: Find the color within the subgrid that is not white (0) and not gray (5). If multiple such colors exist, this rule might need refinement (though not observed in examples). If only white (0) and/or gray (5) pixels are present, the result is white (0).
  - action: Assign Color
    input: Dominant color determined for a subgrid
    output: The corresponding cell in the output grid is set to this color.

constants:
  - name: background_color
    value: 0 (white)
  - name: special_color
    value: 5 (gray)
    role: Ignored when determining the dominant color unless it's the only non-white color present.

examples_summary:
  - train_1: Subgrids containing red or orange (even with gray present) map to red or orange respectively. Subgrids containing only white and/or gray map to white.
  - train_2: Subgrids containing green, azure, orange, magenta, or maroon (even with gray present) map to their respective colors. Subgrids containing only white and/or gray map to white.
