            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: Both input grids are 9x9, and both output grids are 3x3. This strongly suggests the input grid is treated as a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 subgrids.\n2.  **Input-Output Mapping**: Each cell in the 3x3 output grid corresponds spatially to one of the 3x3 subgrids in the input grid. The top-left output cell corresponds to the top-left 3x3 input subgrid, the top-middle output cell to the top-middle 3x3 input subgrid, and so on.\n3.  **Color Significance**: The core task seems to be determining the single color value for each output cell based on the colors present within the corresponding 3x3 input subgrid.\n4.  **Dominant Color**: Within each 3x3 subgrid of the input, there's often a prominent color (other than white) forming a shape or block (e.g., red 'T' in train_1, green block in train_2).\n5.  **Role of Gray (5)**: Gray pixels appear in several input subgrids. Sometimes they replace a pixel within a colored shape (e.g., orange block in train_1, azure block in train_2), other times they appear alone in an otherwise white subgrid.\n6.  **Transformation Logic**: The color of an output cell appears to be the dominant non-white, non-gray color found within the corresponding 3x3 input subgrid. If a subgrid contains *only* white and/or gray pixels, the corresponding output cell is white. The presence of a gray pixel within a subgrid that *also* contains another significant color (like red, orange, green, etc.) does *not* change the output color derived from that significant color.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
