The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in both examples (4x4 for train_1, 6x6 for train_2).\n2.  **Row-Based Changes:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the changes appear to happen independently within specific rows. Some rows are completely unchanged, while others are modified.\n3.  **Pattern in Changed Rows:**\n    *   In `train_1`, rows 0 and 2 (even indices) are identical between input and output. Rows 1 and 3 (odd indices) are different.\n    *   In `train_2`, rows 0, 2, and 4 (even indices) are identical. Rows 1, 3, and 5 (odd indices) are different.\n    *   This suggests a rule based on row index parity: even rows are kept, odd rows are transformed.\n4.  **Transformation Rule for Odd Rows:**\n    *   Let's analyze `train_1`, row 1: Input `[7, 8, 3, 7]`, Output `[7, 7, 8, 3]`.\n        *   The last element `7` moved to the first position.\n        *   The first element `7` moved to the second position.\n        *   The second element `8` moved to the third position.\n        *   The third element `3` moved to the fourth position.\n        *   This is a circular shift to the right by one position.\n    *   Let's check `train_2`, row 1: Input `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`, Output `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`.\n        *   The last element `7` moved to the first position.\n        *   The first element `5` moved to the second position.\n        *   The second element `0` moved to the third position.\n        *   The third element `7` moved to the fourth position.\n        *   The fourth element `7` moved to the fifth position.\n        *   The fifth element `7` moved to the sixth position.\n        *   This also confirms a circular shift to the right by one position for odd-indexed rows.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
