Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels. The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid in both examples (4x4 for train_1, 6x6 for train_2).
2.  **Row-Based Changes:** Comparing inputs and outputs, the changes appear to happen independently within specific rows. Some rows are completely unchanged, while others are modified.
3.  **Pattern in Changed Rows:**
    *   In `train_1`, rows 0 and 2 (even indices) are identical between input and output. Rows 1 and 3 (odd indices) are different.
    *   In `train_2`, rows 0, 2, and 4 (even indices) are identical. Rows 1, 3, and 5 (odd indices) are different.
    *   This suggests a rule based on row index parity: even rows are kept, odd rows are transformed.
4.  **Transformation Rule for Odd Rows:**
    *   Let's analyze `train_1`, row 1: Input `[7, 8, 3, 7]`, Output `[7, 7, 8, 3]`.
        *   The last element `7` moved to the first position.
        *   The first element `7` moved to the second position.
        *   The second element `8` moved to the third position.
        *   The third element `3` moved to the fourth position.
        *   This is a circular shift to the right by one position.
    *   Let's check `train_2`, row 1: Input `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`, Output `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`.
        *   The last element `7` moved to the first position.
        *   The first element `5` moved to the second position.
        *   The second element `0` moved to the third position.
        *   The third element `7` moved to the fourth position.
        *   The fourth element `7` moved to the fifth position.
        *   The fifth element `7` moved to the sixth position.
        *   This also confirms a circular shift to the right by one position for odd-indexed rows.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimension_preservation: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
row_operations:
  - based_on_index: Transformation depends on the row index (0-based).
  - even_index_rows:
      action: No change. Rows are copied directly from input to output.
  - odd_index_rows:
      action: Transformation applied.
      transformation_type: Circular shift.
      direction: Right.
      amount: 1 position.
      details: The element at input[row_index][col_index] moves to output[row_index][(col_index + 1) % width].
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the row index `r` (starting from 0).
3.  Determine if the row index `r` is even or odd.
4.  If `r` is even, copy the entire row from the input grid to the corresponding row `r` in the output grid.
5.  If `r` is odd:
    a.  Get the width `W` of the row.
    b.  Get the list of elements `E` in the input row `r`.
    c.  Create a new list `E_shifted` of the same size.
    d.  For each column index `c` from 0 to `W-1`:
        i.  Calculate the new column index `new_c = (c + 1) % W`.
        ii. Place the element `E[c]` into the new list `E_shifted` at index `new_c`.
    e.  Place the `E_shifted` list into the output grid at row `r`.
6.  Return the completed output grid.
