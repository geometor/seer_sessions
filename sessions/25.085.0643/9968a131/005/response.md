"""
Transforms the input grid by modifying rows based on their index. 
Even-indexed rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are copied directly from the input to the output. 
Odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5, ...) are replaced with a copy of the immediately preceding row (row `r-1`). 
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
