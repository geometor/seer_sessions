task_description: Modifies grid rows based on their index parity.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  - content: Pixel values (colors) are preserved but rearranged.
transformation_rules:
  - scope: Row-based transformation.
  - condition: Row index parity (even or odd).
  - action_even_rows:
      - index: 0, 2, 4, ...
      - operation: Copy the row directly from the input to the output at the same index.
  - action_odd_rows:
      - index: 1, 3, 5, ...
      - precondition: The row index must be greater than 0 (an odd row always has a row above it in a 0-indexed grid).
      - operation: Replace the content of the odd row with the content of the row immediately preceding it (row index `r-1`).
examples:
  - example_index: 1
    input_grid_size: [4, 4]
    output_grid_size: [4, 4]
    modified_rows: [1, 3]
    modification_rule: output[1] = input[0], output[3] = input[2]
  - example_index: 2
    input_grid_size: [6, 6]
    output_grid_size: [6, 6]
    modified_rows: [1, 3, 5]
    modification_rule: output[1] = input[0], output[3] = input[2], output[5] = input[4]
