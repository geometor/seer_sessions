            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the failed attempt and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code correctly identified that the transformation operates differently on even and odd rows. However, it incorrectly assumed that odd rows were replaced by the content of the preceding even row. The comparison between the expected output and the code's output clearly shows this assumption is wrong.\n\n*   **Observation:** Even rows (0, 2, ...) in the output match the corresponding even rows in the input exactly.\n*   **Observation:** Odd rows (1, 3, ...) in the output are different from both the corresponding input odd row *and* the preceding input even row.\n*   **Hypothesis:** The transformation rule involves keeping even rows as they are and applying a specific modification *to the content of the odd rows themselves*.\n\n**Error Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Row 1: `[7, 8, 3, 7]`\n    *   Expected Output Row 1: `[7, 7, 8, 3]`\n    *   Previous Code Output Row 1: `[7, 3, 8, 7]` (Copied Input Row 0)\n    *   The transformation `[7, 8, 3, 7]` -> `[7, 7, 8, 3]` appears to be a cyclic shift of the row elements one position to the right. `7` (last) moves to pos 0, `7` (pos 0) moves to pos 1, `8` (pos 1) moves to pos 2, `3` (pos 2) moves to pos 3. This gives `[7, 7, 8, 3]`. This holds for Row 3 as well.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Row 1: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]`\n    *   Expected Output Row 1: `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`\n    *   Previous Code Output Row 1: `[0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7]` (Copied Input Row 0)\n    *   Applying the cyclic shift right rule: `[5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]` -> `[7, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7]`. This matches the expected output. This holds for Rows 3 and 5 as well.\n\n**Conclusion:** The transformation rule seems to be: keep even rows unchanged, and cyclically shift odd rows one position to the right.\n\n**Strategy Revision:** The new code should implement this revised logic. It will iterate through rows, check if the index is even or odd, and apply the corresponding rule (copy for even, cyclic shift right for odd).\n\n**Metrics**\n"
