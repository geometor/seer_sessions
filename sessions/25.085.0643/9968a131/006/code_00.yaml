task_description: Modifies grid rows based on their index. Even rows are unchanged, odd rows are cyclically shifted right.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have identical dimensions in all examples.
  - symmetry: No obvious grid-level symmetry observed, but the transformation rule treats rows symmetrically based on index parity.
objects:
  - type: row
    properties:
      - index: integer, starting from 0
      - content: list of pixel values (colors)
      - length: width of the grid
    actions:
      - copy: If row index is even, the row content is copied from input to output.
      - cyclic_shift_right: If row index is odd, the row content is cyclically shifted one position to the right. The last element becomes the first element.
