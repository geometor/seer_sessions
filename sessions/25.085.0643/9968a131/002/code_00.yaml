task_description: Transforms an input grid into an output grid.
observations:
  - input_grids: 2D arrays of integers (colors).
  - output_grids: 2D arrays of integers (colors).
  - initial_hypothesis: The transformation involves differential treatment of rows based on parity (even vs. odd index).
  - hypothesis_details: Even rows are copied; odd rows are circularly shifted right by 1.
  - hypothesis_status: FAILED - Code implementing this hypothesis failed on at least two training examples.
  - failure_mode: Errors indicate issues with potentially non-uniform grid shapes ('inhomogeneous shape') during validation, suggesting the implemented rule does not produce the correct expected outputs.
artifacts:
  - objects: Rows within the grid.
  - properties: Row index (parity: even/odd), row content (sequence of colors).
  - actions: Copying a row, Circularly shifting a row.
uncertainties:
  - The exact transformation rule is unknown.
  - The conditions under which specific actions (like shifting) apply are unclear.
  - Whether grid dimensions change between input and output is unconfirmed for all examples.
  - Cause of the "inhomogeneous shape" error (input data structure vs. comparison artifact) is uncertain without example data.
