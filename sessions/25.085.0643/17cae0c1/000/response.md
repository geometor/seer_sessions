*   **Perception:** The task operates on 3x9 grids. Both input and output grids have these dimensions. The input grids contain only 'white' (0) and 'gray' (5) pixels. The output grids are composed of solid 3x3 blocks of various colors. The transformation seems to involve analyzing 3x3 sections of the input grid and mapping each section's pattern to a specific output color, which then fills the corresponding 3x3 section in the output grid.

```yaml
    task_description: Map 3x3 patterns of gray pixels to specific output colors.
    grid_properties:
      input_dimensions: 3x9
      output_dimensions: 3x9
      input_colors: [0 (white), 5 (gray)]
      output_colors: Multiple colors, forming solid 3x3 blocks.
    objects:
      - type: grid_section
        definition: Non-overlapping 3x3 blocks within the input grid.
        count: 3 per input grid (arranged horizontally).
      - type: pattern
        definition: The arrangement of 'gray' (5) pixels within a 3x3 grid_section.
      - type: color_mapping
        definition: A fixed rule associating each unique input pattern with a specific output color.
    transformations:
      - action: partition
        input: input grid
        output: three 3x3 blocks
        details: Divide the 3x9 input grid into three adjacent 3x3 blocks.
      - action: map_pattern_to_color
        input: each 3x3 input block (pattern)
        output: a single color value
        details: Apply a predefined mapping rule based on the pattern of gray pixels.
      - action: fill_block
        input: a color value derived from map_pattern_to_color
        output: a 3x3 block filled with that color
        details: Create a solid 3x3 block using the mapped color.
      - action: assemble
        input: three 3x3 colored blocks
        output: the final 3x9 output grid
        details: Combine the generated 3x3 colored blocks horizontally in the original order.
    pattern_color_map:
      - pattern: [[5,5,5],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
        color: 6 # Magenta
      - pattern: [[5,5,5],[5,0,5],[5,5,5]]
        color: 3 # Green
      - pattern: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[5,5,5]]
        color: 1 # Blue
      - pattern: [[0,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,0]]
        color: 9 # Maroon
      - pattern: [[0,0,0],[0,5,0],[0,0,0]]
        color: 4 # Yellow
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Divide the 3x9 input grid into three adjacent 3x3 blocks (Block 1: columns 0-2, Block 2: columns 3-5, Block 3: columns 6-8).
    2.  For each 3x3 block obtained in step 1:
        a.  Examine the pattern formed by the gray (5) and white (0) pixels within the block.
        b.  Consult a fixed mapping rule to find the output color associated with this specific 3x3 pattern. The known mappings are:
            *   Pattern `[[5,5,5],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]` maps to Magenta (6).
            *   Pattern `[[5,5,5],[5,0,5],[5,5,5]]` maps to Green (3).
            *   Pattern `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[5,5,5]]` maps to Blue (1).
            *   Pattern `[[0,0,5],[0,5,0],[5,0,0]]` maps to Maroon (9).
            *   Pattern `[[0,0,0],[0,5,0],[0,0,0]]` maps to Yellow (4).
        c.  Create a new 3x3 block filled entirely with the determined output color.
    3.  Construct the final 3x9 output grid by placing the three newly created 3x3 colored blocks side-by-side, maintaining the original left-to-right order corresponding to the input blocks.
