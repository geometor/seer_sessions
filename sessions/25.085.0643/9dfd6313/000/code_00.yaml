task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - background_color: white (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) tuple
  - type: line
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
      - persistence: remains unchanged between input and output.
transformation:
  - type: geometric
  - name: reflection / transposition
  - axis: main diagonal
  - rule: pixel at input position (r, c) moves to output position (c, r).
  - effect_on_diagonal: pixels on the main diagonal (where r == c) remain stationary.
  - effect_on_background: white pixels fill any position in the output grid not occupied by a transposed non-white pixel.
