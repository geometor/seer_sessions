These gray pixels remain in the exact same positions in the output grids.\n3.  **Transformation:** Other colored pixels (non-white, non-gray) change their positions from input to output.\n4.  **Pattern of Movement:** The movement follows a specific geometric pattern. A pixel located at `(row, column)` in the input appears at `(column, row)` in the output. This is consistent across all non-gray, non-white pixels in all examples.\n5.  **Background:** White pixels (color 0) act as the background. Their positions in the output are determined by the positions *not* occupied by the moved colored pixels or the stationary gray pixels.\n6.  **Overall Operation:** The transformation appears to be a reflection of the grid across its main diagonal, which is mathematically equivalent to a matrix transposition.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
