Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are square grids of varying sizes (4x4, 3x3, 5x5).
2.  **Key Feature:** The gray pixels (color 5) consistently form the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) in the input grids. These gray pixels remain in the exact same positions in the output grids.
3.  **Transformation:** Other colored pixels (non-white, non-gray) change their positions from input to output.
4.  **Pattern of Movement:** The movement follows a specific geometric pattern. A pixel located at `(row, column)` in the input appears at `(column, row)` in the output. This is consistent across all non-gray, non-white pixels in all examples.
5.  **Background:** White pixels (color 0) act as the background. Their positions in the output are determined by the positions *not* occupied by the moved colored pixels or the stationary gray pixels.
6.  **Overall Operation:** The transformation appears to be a reflection of the grid across its main diagonal, which is mathematically equivalent to a matrix transposition.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
dimensionality: 2D
grid_properties:
  - size_relation: input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - background_color: white (0) is the predominant background color.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) tuple
  - type: line
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
      - persistence: remains unchanged between input and output.
transformation:
  - type: geometric
  - name: reflection / transposition
  - axis: main diagonal
  - rule: pixel at input position (r, c) moves to output position (c, r).
  - effect_on_diagonal: pixels on the main diagonal (where r == c) remain stationary.
  - effect_on_background: white pixels fill any position in the output grid not occupied by a transposed non-white pixel.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, where `r` is the row index and `c` is the column index.
3.  Retrieve the color value `v` from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
4.  Place the color value `v` into the output grid at the transposed position `(c, r)`.
5.  After iterating through all cells of the input grid, the resulting output grid represents the completed transformation.
