"""
Perform a grid transposition (reflection across the main diagonal).

1. Initialize an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (0).
2. Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid, where `r` is the row index and `c` is the column index.
3. Retrieve the color value `v` from the input grid at `(r, c)`.
4. Place the color value `v` into the output grid at the transposed position `(c, r)`.
5. Return the completed output grid.
