task_description: Color replacement based on pixel value.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid:
      colors_present: [Magenta (6), Orange (7)]
      dimensionality: 2D array
      size_constraint: Variable (examples show 6x4, 3x4, 3x6)
  - output_grid:
      colors_present: [Red (2), Orange (7)]
      dimensionality: 2D array
      size_constraint: Same dimensions as the corresponding input grid
transformation:
  type: Pixel-wise color substitution
  rules:
    - condition: Input pixel color is Magenta (6)
      action: Change pixel color to Red (2)
    - condition: Input pixel color is Orange (7)
      action: Keep pixel color as Orange (7)
  scope: Applied to every pixel individually.
relationships:
  - The position of each pixel in the output grid corresponds directly to its position in the input grid.
  - The transformation rule is consistent across all provided examples.
