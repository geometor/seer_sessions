            "text": "## Perception of Task Elements\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions. The grids contain pixels of different colors. In the provided examples, the input grids contain only two colors: Magenta (6) and Orange (7). The output grids contain Red (2) and Orange (7).\n\nObserving the examples, it's clear that the transformation involves a color substitution. Specifically, every pixel that is Magenta (6) in the input grid is changed to Red (2) in the output grid. All pixels that are Orange (7) in the input grid remain Orange (7) in the output grid. The position of each pixel remains unchanged. This is a simple, pixel-wise color replacement rule.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
