## Perception
The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid. By observing the examples, the transformation appears to be a geometric manipulation of the entire grid. Specifically, the pixels from the input grid seem to be rearranged to form the output grid, maintaining the same set of colors but altering their positions. Comparing the input and output grids in each example reveals a consistent pattern: the output grid is the input grid rotated by 180 degrees. For instance, the pixel at the top-left corner of the input moves to the bottom-right corner of the output, the pixel at the top-right moves to the bottom-left, and the center pixel remains in the center.
