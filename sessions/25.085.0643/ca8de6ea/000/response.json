There are exactly 9 non-white pixels in each input example.\n    *   The output grid consists only of the non-white pixels found in the input grid.\n    *   The white pixels from the input grid are discarded.\n    *   The relative order of the non-white pixels, when read from the input grid row by row, top to bottom, and left to right within each row, is preserved in the output grid, filling it in the same order (row by row, left to right).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
