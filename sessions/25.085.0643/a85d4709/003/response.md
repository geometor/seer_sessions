"""
Transform an input grid row by row based on the column position of a gray pixel (5).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
For each row in the input grid:
1. Find the column index 'c' where the gray pixel (color 5) is located.
2. Determine the color 'fill_color' for the corresponding output row based on 'c':
   - If 'c' is 0, 'fill_color' is red (2).
   - If 'c' is 1, 'fill_color' is yellow (4).
   - If 'c' is 2, 'fill_color' is green (3).
3. Fill the entire row in the output grid at the same row index with 'fill_color'.
Return the completed output grid.
