*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids are 3x3 and contain only 'white' (0) and 'gray' (5) pixels.
    *   Each row in the input grids appears to contain exactly one 'gray' pixel.
    *   The output grids are also 3x3.
    *   Each row in the output grids is filled with a single, uniform color, specifically 'red' (2), 'green' (3), or 'yellow' (4).
    *   The color filling each output row seems to be determined by the position (column index) of the 'gray' pixel in the corresponding input row.
    *   Comparing across examples reveals a consistent mapping:
        *   Gray pixel in column 0 of an input row -> Output row is filled with 'red' (2).
        *   Gray pixel in column 1 of an input row -> Output row is filled with 'yellow' (4).
        *   Gray pixel in column 2 of an input row -> Output row is filled with 'green' (3).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: transformation
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (observed as 3x3 in examples).
      - input_colors: Primarily 'white' (0) and 'gray' (5).
      - output_colors: 'red' (2), 'green' (3), 'yellow' (4).
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: 'gray' (5) in the input.
          - role: Acts as a trigger or indicator within each row.
          - relationship: Its column position determines the output row's color.
      - type: row
        properties:
          - input: Contains one 'gray' (5) pixel and 'white' (0) pixels.
          - output: Filled entirely with a single color derived from the input row's 'gray' pixel position.
    transformation: row-wise color filling
    rules:
      - for each row:
          - find the column index 'c' of the 'gray' (5) pixel.
          - determine the output color 'out_color' based on 'c':
              - if c == 0, out_color = 'red' (2)
              - if c == 1, out_color = 'yellow' (4)
              - if c == 2, out_color = 'green' (3)
          - fill the corresponding output row entirely with 'out_color'.
    assumptions:
      - Each input row contains exactly one 'gray' (5) pixel.
      - The grid dimensions are consistent between input and output.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    2.  For each row in the input grid, starting from row index 0:
        a.  Find the column index where the pixel value is 'gray' (5).
        b.  Determine the fill color for the corresponding row in the output grid based on this column index:
            i.  If the gray pixel is in column 0, the fill color is 'red' (2).
            ii. If the gray pixel is in column 1, the fill color is 'yellow' (4).
            iii.If the gray pixel is in column 2, the fill color is 'green' (3).
        c.  Fill all cells in the current row of the output grid with the determined fill color.
    3.  Return the completed output grid.
