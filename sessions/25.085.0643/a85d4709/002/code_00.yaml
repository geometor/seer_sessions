task_context:
  description: Transforms a grid row by row based on the column position of a specific pixel color.
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
    - All example grids have a width of 3.
    - Input grids contain exactly one gray pixel (5) in each row.
    - All other pixels in the input grid are white (0).
    - Output grids consist of rows filled entirely with a single color.

objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
        role: indicator
        location: Exactly one per input row. Its column index determines the output row color.
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
        location: All non-gray pixels in the input.
      - color: red (2)
        role: output_fill
        condition: Input row's gray pixel is in column 0.
      - color: yellow (4)
        role: output_fill
        condition: Input row's gray pixel is in column 1.
      - color: green (3)
        role: output_fill
        condition: Input row's gray pixel is in column 2.

actions:
  - action: process_rows_independently
    description: Each input row is processed to determine the corresponding output row.
  - action: locate_indicator
    input: input_row
    output: column_index_of_gray_pixel
    description: Find the column index (0, 1, or 2) of the gray pixel (5) within the row.
  - action: determine_output_color
    input: column_index_of_gray_pixel
    output: fill_color
    description: Map the column index to an output color using the rule {0: red(2), 1: yellow(4), 2: green(3)}.
  - action: generate_output_row
    input: fill_color, row_width
    output: output_row
    description: Create a new row of the same width as the input row, filled entirely with the determined fill_color.
  - action: construct_output_grid
    input: list_of_output_rows
    output: output_grid
    description: Assemble the generated output rows into the final output grid, maintaining the original order.
