The background color is consistently white (0). The non-white pixels form distinct shapes or patterns within the grid.\n3.  **Transformation:** Comparing each input grid to its corresponding output grid, the pattern appears to be a rotation of the entire grid.\n4.  **Rotation Direction:**\n    *   In example 1, the bottom-left 'L' shape (maroon) moves to the top-right, consistent with a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n    *   In example 2, the 'C'-like shape (magenta) rotates similarly.\n    *   In example 3, the red pattern rotates.\n    *   In example 4, the larger 'L' shape (maroon) rotates.\n    All examples consistently show a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n5.  **Content Preservation:** The colors and relative positions of the pixels within the grid are preserved during the rotation. No pixels change color or disappear/appear; they only change their absolute position due to the rotation of the grid itself.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
