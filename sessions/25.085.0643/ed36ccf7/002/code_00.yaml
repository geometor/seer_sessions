Task: Rotate grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise

Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: 3x3 matrix of integers (colors).
      Objects: Can be viewed as the entire grid pattern.
      Properties: Contains various colors (maroon, white, magenta, red).
    Output:
      Grid: 3x3 matrix, same colors as input.
      Objects: The pattern is rotated.
    Action: Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Grid_Properties:
  - All examples use 3x3 input and output grids.
  - The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
  - The transformation preserves the counts of each color.

Transformation:
  - Type: Geometric Rotation
  - Angle: 90 degrees
  - Direction: Counter-clockwise
  - Rule: A pixel at input coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) moves to output coordinates (`width - 1 - c`, `r`), where `width` is the number of columns in the input grid.
