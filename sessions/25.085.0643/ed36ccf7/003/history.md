The tool confirms that a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation works for Example 2. Since it worked for all four examples during manual checking and code verification for one, this is the highly likely transformation.

**Plan:**
1.  State the assessment: The previous code failed because it performed a clockwise rotation instead of a counter-clockwise one.
2.  Provide metrics: All examples are 3x3 grids. The transformation is confirmed as a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
3.  Create YAML facts: Describe the input grid and the single action (CCW rotation).
4.  Write the natural language program: Describe the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.**General Assessment**

The previous code implemented a 90-degree *clockwise* rotation based on the initial analysis (likely of just the first example, misinterpreted). However, testing this code against all four training examples revealed that it produced incorrect outputs for every case. The comparison between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output` (generated by the clockwise rotation code) shows significant differences in pixel positions, although grid size and color palettes remain consistent.

The strategy to resolve the errors involves re-analyzing the input-output pairs across all examples to find a transformation rule that holds true for all of them. Comparing the input grids with the *expected* output grids suggests a different type of rotation might be involved.

**Metrics and Analysis**

Let's analyze the relationship between the input and expected output for each example:

*   **Grid Dimensions:** All input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3. This means the transformation preserves the dimensions.
*   **Transformation Hypothesis:**
    *   Example 1: Input `[[0,0,9],[0,0,9],[9,9,9]]`, Output `[[9,9,9],[0,0,9],[0,0,9]]`. This matches a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation (or a vertical reflection).
    *   Example 2: Input `[[6,6,6],[0,0,0],[6,6,0]]`, Output `[[6,0,0],[6,0,6],[6,0,6]]`. This matches a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. It does *not* match a vertical reflection (`[[6,6,0],[0,0,0],[6,6,6]]`).
    *   Example 3: Input `[[2,0,2],[0,0,2],[0,2,2]]`, Output `[[2,2,2],[0,0,2],[2,0,0]]`. This matches a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
    *   Example 4: Input `[[9,0,0],[9,9,9],[9,9,9]]`, Output `[[0,9,9],[0,9,9],[9,9,9]]`. This matches a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

*   **Confirmation via Code Execution:** We can verify the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation hypothesis using numpy's `rot90` function (which defaults to counter-clockwise). Let's test Example 3:
    

*code_execution:*
```python
    import numpy as np

    input_grid_ex3 = np.array([[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]])
    expected_output_ex3 = np.array([[2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0]])

    # Perform 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation (k=1)
    rotated_grid_ex3 = np.rot90(input_grid_ex3, k=1)

    print("Input Grid (Example 3):")
    print(input_grid_ex3)
    print("\nCounter-Clockwise Rotated Grid (Example 3):")
    print(rotated_grid_ex3)
    print("\nExpected Output (Example 3):")
    print(expected_output_ex3)

    match_ex3 = np.array_equal(rotated_grid_ex3, expected_output_ex3)
    print(f"\nDoes CCW rotation match expected output for Example 3? {match_ex3}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input Grid (Example 3):
[[2 0 2]
 [0 0 2]
 [0 2 2]]

Counter-Clockwise Rotated Grid (Example 3):
[[2 2 2]
 [0 0 2]
 [2 0 0]]

Expected Output (Example 3):
[[2 2 2]
 [0 0 2]
 [2 0 0]]

Does CCW rotation match expected output for Example 3? True

```
The code execution confirms that a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation correctly transforms the input to the expected output for Example 3, consistent with the observations for the other examples.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Rotate grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise

Examples:
  - Input:
      Grid: 3x3 matrix of integers (colors).
      Objects: Can be viewed as the entire grid pattern.
      Properties: Contains various colors (maroon, white, magenta, red).
    Output:
      Grid: 3x3 matrix, same colors as input.
      Objects: The pattern is rotated.
    Action: Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Grid_Properties:
  - All examples use 3x3 input and output grids.
  - The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
  - The transformation preserves the counts of each color.

Transformation:
  - Type: Geometric Rotation
  - Angle: 90 degrees
  - Direction: Counter-clockwise
  - Rule: A pixel at input coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) moves to output coordinates (`width - 1 - c`, `r`), where `width` is the number of columns in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid.
2.  Determine the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the input grid.
3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `W` (height) x `H` (width).
4.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W-1`).
5.  For each input pixel at `(r, c)`, calculate its new position in the output grid:
    *   The new row index (`new_r`) is `W - 1 - c`.
    *   The new column index (`new_c`) is `r`.
6.  Place the color value of the input pixel `input_grid[r][c]` into the output grid at position `output_grid[new_r][new_c]`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
