Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids vary in size (9x9, 6x6) but are always square and dimensions seem to be multiples of 3. They are sparsely populated, containing mostly 'white' pixels (0) and exactly nine non-'white' pixels (1-9).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 3x3. They contain only the non-'white' pixels found in the corresponding input grid.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The non-'white' pixels from the input are rearranged into the output. The key observation is that the input grid can be perfectly divided into a 3x3 grid of smaller, equal-sized blocks (e.g., a 9x9 grid becomes nine 3x3 blocks; a 6x6 grid becomes nine 2x2 blocks). Each of these nine blocks in the input contains exactly one non-'white' pixel. The position of a block in the 3x3 division of the input grid corresponds directly to the position of its contained non-'white' pixel in the 3x3 output grid.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
task_description: "Extract non-white pixels from a 3x3 grid of blocks within the input and arrange them into a 3x3 output grid based on their block origin."

input_characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: Square, width and height are multiples of 3 (e.g., 6x6, 9x9).
  - content:
      - Mostly 'white' pixels (value 0).
      - Exactly nine non-'white' pixels (values 1-9).
  - structure: Can be divided into a 3x3 grid of equal-sized blocks. Each block contains exactly one non-'white' pixel.

output_characteristics:
  - type: grid
  - dimensions: Always 3x3.
  - content: Contains only the non-'white' pixels from the input grid. No 'white' pixels.

transformation:
  - name: Block Division
    details: Divide the input grid into nine equal-sized subgrids (blocks) arranged in a 3x3 pattern. The size of each block is (input_height/3) x (input_width/3).
  - name: Pixel Extraction
    details: Iterate through the nine blocks in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right). For each block, find the single non-'white' pixel within it.
  - name: Output Grid Construction
    details: Create a new 3x3 grid. Place the extracted non-'white' pixel from the input block at position (block_row, block_col) into the output grid at the corresponding position (block_row, block_col).

examples_summary:
  - example_1: 9x9 input -> nine 3x3 blocks. The non-white pixel from block (0,0) goes to output (0,0), from block (0,1) goes to output (0,1), ..., from block (2,2) goes to output (2,2).
  - example_2: 6x6 input -> nine 2x2 blocks. Same mapping logic applies.
  - example_3: 6x6 input -> nine 2x2 blocks. Same mapping logic applies.

relationship:
  - The spatial position (in the 3x3 block grid) of the block containing a non-white pixel in the input determines the position of that pixel in the 3x3 output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input grid.
2.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid, height `H` and width `W`.
3.  Calculate the dimensions of the blocks: `block_height = H / 3` and `block_width = W / 3`.
4.  Initialize an empty 3x3 grid to store the output.
5.  Iterate through the block grid using row index `block_row` from 0 to 2 and column index `block_col` from 0 to 2.
6.  For each `(block_row, block_col)` pair, search within the corresponding block in the input grid. The block spans rows from `block_row * block_height` to `(block_row + 1) * block_height - 1` and columns from `block_col * block_width` to `(block_col + 1) * block_width - 1`.
7.  Find the single pixel within this block that has a non-zero value (i.e., is not 'white').
8.  Take the value (color) of this found pixel.
9.  Place this value into the output grid at the position `(block_row, block_col)`.
10. After iterating through all nine blocks, return the completed 3x3 output grid.
