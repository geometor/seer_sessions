They are sparsely populated, containing mostly 'white' pixels (0) and exactly nine non-'white' pixels (1-9).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 3x3. They contain only the non-'white' pixels found in the corresponding input grid.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The non-'white' pixels from the input are rearranged into the output. The key observation is that the input grid can be perfectly divided into a 3x3 grid of smaller, equal-sized blocks (e.g., a 9x9 grid becomes nine 3x3 blocks; a 6x6 grid becomes nine 2x2 blocks). Each of these nine blocks in the input contains exactly one non-'white' pixel. The position of a block in the 3x3 division of the input grid corresponds directly to the position of its contained non-'white' pixel in the 3x3 output grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"

The size of each block is (input_height/3) x (input_width/3).\n  - name: Pixel Extraction\n    details: Iterate through the nine blocks in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right).

The non-white pixel from block (0,0) goes to output (0,0), from block (0,1) goes to output (0,1), ..., from block (2,2) goes to output (2,2).\n  - example_2: 6x6 input -> nine 2x2 blocks. Same mapping logic applies.\n  - example_3: 6x6 input -> nine 2x2 blocks. Same mapping logic applies.\n\nrelationship:\n  - The spatial position (in the 3x3 block grid) of the block containing a non-white pixel in the input determines the position of that pixel in the 3x3 output grid.\n```"
