If only one quadrant has this maximum count, select that quadrant.\n    4.  If more than one quadrant shares the maximum count, then determine the minimum count among the four quadrants. If only one quadrant has this minimum count, select that quadrant.\n    5.  If the counts are the same across all four quadrants (meaning neither the maximum nor the minimum count was unique), select the Bottom-Right quadrant.\n    6.
