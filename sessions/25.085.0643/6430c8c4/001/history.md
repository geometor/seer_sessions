Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is consistently composed of three distinct parts:
    *   A top subgrid (`grid_A`).
    *   A single horizontal row composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels, acting as a separator.
    *   A bottom subgrid (`grid_B`).
    In all examples, `grid_A` and `grid_B` have the same dimensions (4x4 in these cases).

2.  **Pixel Content:**
    *   `grid_A` contains only orange (7) and white (0) pixels.
    *   `grid_B` contains only red (2) and white (0) pixels.
    *   The separator row contains only yellow (4) pixels.

3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has the same dimensions as `grid_A` and `grid_B`.

4.  **Output Content:** The output grid contains only green (3) and white (0) pixels.

5.  **Transformation:** The output seems to be generated by comparing `grid_A` and `grid_B` on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Specifically, observing the examples suggests that a green (3) pixel appears in the output only at positions where *both* `grid_A` and `grid_B` have a white (0) pixel. All other positions in the output grid are white (0).

**Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_grid
    description: A composite grid containing two subgrids separated by a yellow line.
    properties:
      height: Varies (e.g., 9 in examples)
      width: Varies (e.g., 4 in examples)
      contains_separator: true
      separator_color: yellow (4)
      separator_orientation: horizontal

  - item: grid_A
    description: The subgrid located above the yellow separator line.
    properties:
      dimensions: Matches grid_B dimensions (e.g., 4x4)
      pixels: Contains only orange (7) and white (0)

  - item: grid_B
    description: The subgrid located below the yellow separator line.
    properties:
      dimensions: Matches grid_A dimensions (e.g., 4x4)
      pixels: Contains only red (2) and white (0)

  - item: output_grid
    description: The resulting grid after the transformation.
    properties:
      dimensions: Matches grid_A and grid_B dimensions
      pixels: Contains only green (3) and white (0)

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: [grid_A, grid_B]
    target: output_grid
    rule: Pixel-wise comparison based on color value 0.

transformation_rule:
  - step: 1
    action: locate_separator
    input: input_grid
    criteria: Find the row consisting entirely of yellow (4) pixels.
    output: separator_row_index

  - step: 2
    action: extract_subgrids
    input: input_grid, separator_row_index
    outputs: [grid_A, grid_B]
    details: grid_A is above the separator, grid_B is below.

  - step: 3
    action: initialize_output
    input: grid_A # (for dimensions)
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a new grid with the same dimensions as grid_A, filled with white (0).

  - step: 4
    action: pixel_wise_comparison
    inputs: [grid_A, grid_B, output_grid]
    condition: For each coordinate (row, col)
    logic: If grid_A[row, col] is white (0) AND grid_B[row, col] is white (0)
    effect: Set output_grid[row, col] to green (3).
    # Note: No explicit 'else' needed as the grid is pre-filled with white (0).

  - step: 5
    action: finalize
    input: output_grid
    output: final_output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the horizontal separator line within the input grid, characterized by consisting entirely of yellow (4) pixels.
2.  Extract the subgrid located above the separator line (let's call it `grid_A`).
3.  Extract the subgrid located below the separator line (let's call it `grid_B`).
4.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of `grid_A` (which will be the same as `grid_B`).
5.  Create a new output grid with these same dimensions, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
6.  Iterate through each cell position, defined by its row and column index, within the dimensions of `grid_A` and `grid_B`.
7.  For each cell position (row, column):
    *   Check the color of the pixel at this position in `grid_A`.
    *   Check the color of the pixel at this position in `grid_B`.
    *   If *both* the pixel in `grid_A` and the pixel in `grid_B` at this position are white (0), then set the color of the pixel at the corresponding position in the output grid to green (3).
8.  The resulting output grid is the final answer.
