Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Colors:** The primary colors involved are red (2) and white (0) in the input. The output introduces blue (1).
2.  **Shapes/Objects:** The red pixels sometimes form contiguous shapes, but often appear as individual pixels or parts of larger structures.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing *some* red pixels (2) into blue pixels (1). Not all red pixels are changed.
4.  **Consistency:** The background white pixels (0) remain unchanged in all examples. The positions of the red pixels that *don't* change also remain the same.
5.  **Neighborhood:** The key factor determining whether a red pixel changes seems to relate to its immediate surroundings. Let's examine the red pixels that change:
    *   In `train_1`, the red pixel at `(2, 3)` changes. Its neighbors (up, down, left, right) are `(1, 3)=0`, `(3, 3)=0`, `(2, 2)=0`. None are red.
    *   In `train_2`, the red pixels at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 1)` change.
        *   `(2, 3)` neighbors: `(1, 3)=0`, `(3, 3)=0`, `(2, 2)=0`. None red.
        *   `(3, 1)` neighbors: `(2, 1)=0`, `(3, 0)=0`, `(3, 2)=0`. None red.
    *   In `train_3`, the red pixels at `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` change.
        *   `(1, 2)` neighbors: `(0, 2)=0`, `(2, 2)=0`, `(1, 1)=0`. None red.
        *   `(2, 1)` neighbors: `(1, 1)=0`, `(2, 0)=0`, `(2, 2)=0`. None red.
    *   In `train_4`, the red pixel at `(2, 0)` changes. Its neighbors within bounds are `(1, 0)=0`, `(2, 1)=0`. None red.
6.  **Contrast:** Now consider red pixels that *don't* change. For example, in `train_1`, the red pixel at `(0, 0)` has a red neighbor at `(0, 1)`. The red pixel at `(1, 1)` has red neighbors at `(0, 1)` and `(2, 1)`.
7.  **Conclusion:** A red pixel changes to blue if and only if none of its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also red. These are "isolated" red pixels in terms of cardinal adjacency.

**Facts:**

    condition: "Always applies."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For each pixel, check if its color is red (2).
4.  If the pixel is red, examine its four cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right), staying within the grid boundaries.
5.  Count how many of these cardinal neighbors are also red (2).
6.  If the count of adjacent red neighbors is zero, change the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1).
7.  If the pixel is not red, or if it is red but has one or more red cardinal neighbors, keep its original color in the output grid.
8.  Return the modified output grid.
