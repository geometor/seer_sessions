*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The inputs are 3x3 grids containing white (0) and red (2) pixels.
    *   The outputs are single-digit numbers: 1 (blue) or 7 (orange).
    *   The arrangement of the red pixels within the 3x3 grid determines the output value.
    *   Comparing examples where the output is 1 (train\_1, train\_5, train\_6) with examples where the output is 7 (train\_2, train\_3, train\_4), a pattern emerges related to symmetry.
    *   Specifically, inputs resulting in output 1 exhibit vertical symmetry. The first column is identical to the third column.
    *   Inputs resulting in output 7 lack this vertical symmetry.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Determine an output value based on the symmetry of red pixels in a 3x3 input grid.
    elements:
      - type: grid
        description: Input is a 3x3 grid.
        pixels:
          - color: white (0)
          - color: red (2)
      - type: value
        description: Output is a single integer.
        possible_values: [1, 7] # Corresponds to blue and orange
    objects:
      - id: red_pattern
        description: The configuration of red pixels within the input grid.
    properties:
      - object: red_pattern
        property: vertical_symmetry
        description: Whether the pattern of red pixels is identical when reflected across the vertical centerline of the grid. This is equivalent to checking if the first column is identical to the third column in a 3x3 grid.
    transformation:
      rule: Check for vertical symmetry of the entire input grid.
      conditions:
        - if: grid has vertical symmetry
          output: 1 (blue)
        - if: grid does not have vertical symmetry
          output: 7 (orange)

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the 3x3 input grid.
    2.  Examine the first column (column index 0) and the third column (column index 2) of the grid.
    3.  Compare the pixels in the first column with the corresponding pixels in the third column, row by row.
    4.  If every pixel in the first column matches the pixel in the same row of the third column, the grid possesses vertical symmetry. In this case, the output is 1 (blue).
    5.  Otherwise, if there is any mismatch between the first and third columns, the grid lacks vertical symmetry. In this case, the output is 7 (orange).
