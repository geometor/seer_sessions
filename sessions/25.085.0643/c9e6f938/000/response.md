*   **Perception:**
    *   The task involves transforming an input grid into a larger output grid.
    *   All examples show the input grid being replicated on the left side of the output grid.
    *   The right side of the output grid appears to be a horizontal reflection (mirror image) of the input grid.
    *   The output grid's height remains the same as the input grid's height.
    *   The output grid's width is exactly double the input grid's width.
    *   The transformation preserves the colors and relative vertical positions of the pixels.
    *   The reflection axis is the vertical line along the right edge of the input grid.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: horizontal_reflection_concatenation
    input_grid:
      properties:
        - dimensions: H (height) x W (width)
        - content: pattern of pixels
    output_grid:
      properties:
        - dimensions: H x (2 * W)
        - content: composite of original and transformed input
      composition:
        - left_half: Identical copy of the input grid (columns 0 to W-1).
        - right_half: Horizontal reflection of the input grid (columns W to 2*W-1).
    transformation:
      type: reflection
      axis: vertical, along the right edge of the input grid
      action: concatenate the original input grid with its horizontal reflection
    relationships:
      - output_height == input_height
      - output_width == 2 * input_width
      - output_grid[r, c] == input_grid[r, c] for 0 <= c < W
      - output_grid[r, c] == input_grid[r, (2*W - 1) - c] for W <= c < 2*W
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Get the input grid. Let its height be H and width be W.
    2.  Create a new output grid with height H and width (2 * W).
    3.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to H-1 and each column `c` from 0 to W-1 of the input grid.
    4.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (`r`, `c`) to the output grid at the same position (`r`, `c`).
    5.  Calculate the corresponding reflected column index `c_reflected` for the right half of the output grid as `(2 * W - 1) - c`.
    6.  Copy the pixel value from the input grid at position (`r`, `c`) to the output grid at position (`r`, `c_reflected`).
    7.  Return the completed output grid.
