"""
Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
Iterate through each column c of the grid.
Within each column c, iterate through the rows r starting from the second row (index 1) down to the last row (index height - 1).
For each cell at (r, c):
  a. Check if the cell (r, c) in the current output grid is white (color 0).
  b. If it is white, check the color of the cell directly above it, at (r-1, c), in the current output grid.
  c. If the cell above (r-1, c) is *not* white, update the color of the current cell (r, c) in the output grid to match the color of the cell above (r-1, c).
After iterating through all specified cells, the resulting output grid is the final transformed grid.
