task_context:
  grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
  colors: The transformation involves white (0) and various other colors (non-zero).
  background_color: White (0) acts as the background or empty space.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0 to 9.
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - is_colored: Boolean (True if color is not 0, False otherwise).
actions:
  - name: fill_down
    description: A non-white pixel's color propagates downwards into adjacent white pixels within the same column.
    conditions:
      - The target pixel must be white (0).
      - The pixel directly above the target pixel must be non-white.
    effect: The target pixel's color changes to match the color of the pixel directly above it.
relationships:
  - type: vertical_adjacency
    description: Pixels in the same column, one directly above the other.
  - type: column_independence
    description: The transformation process within one column does not directly affect other columns.
  - type: propagation
    description: The color-filling effect cascades downwards. If cell (r-1, c) colors cell (r, c), and cell (r+1, c) is white, then cell (r+1, c) will subsequently be colored by the new color at (r, c).
