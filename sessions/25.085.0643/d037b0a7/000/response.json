Observing the examples, it appears that non-white pixels (colors other than 0) have an effect on the white pixels (color 0) located directly below them within the same column. Specifically, if a cell contains a non-white color, any white cell immediately below it adopts that color. This effect propagates downwards within the column, essentially \"staining\" or \"filling\" the white space below a colored pixel with that same color. The process occurs independently for each column. If a cell is white and the cell directly above it is also white, it remains white unless affected by a color further up in the column.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
