Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The input is always a small grid (3x3 in all examples).
2.  **Color Palette:** Each input grid contains predominantly white pixels (color 0) and a set of pixels of a single other color (orange-7, red-2, azure-8, blue-1).
3.  **Output Structure:** The output is always a single row (a 1xN grid).
4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to represent the non-white pixels found in the input grid.
5.  **Key Observation:** The number of pixels in the output grid directly corresponds to the *count* of the non-white pixels in the input grid. The color of the output pixels is the same as the non-white color in the input. The original positions of the non-white pixels in the input grid do not seem relevant to the output structure, only their count and color matter.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extracts non-white pixels from the input grid and represents their count and color in a single-row output grid.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    description: A 2D array containing pixels.
    properties:
      - Contains mostly white (0) pixels.
      - Contains a set of pixels of a single non-white color.
  - element: non_white_pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are not white (value > 0).
    properties:
      - All share the same color within a single input grid.
      - Their count is variable.
      - Their positions within the input grid vary.
  - element: output_grid
    description: A 2D array representing the result.
    properties:
      - Always has a height of 1.
      - Width equals the count of non_white_pixels in the input_grid.
      - All pixels have the same color, matching the color of the non_white_pixels in the input_grid.

relationships:
  - relation: count_matches_width
    description: The number of non_white_pixels in the input_grid determines the width of the output_grid.
  - relation: color_preservation
    description: The color of the non_white_pixels in the input_grid determines the color of all pixels in the output_grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_non_white
    description: Find all pixels in the input_grid with a value greater than 0.
  - action: determine_color
    description: Identify the color of the non_white_pixels (assuming only one non-white color exists).
  - action: count_pixels
    description: Count the total number of non_white_pixels identified.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid with 1 row and N columns (where N is the count from count_pixels), filling it entirely with the color determined by determine_color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels that are not white (color code 0).
2.  Identify the color of these non-white pixels (there will be only one such color).
3.  Count how many non-white pixels were found. Let this count be `N`.
4.  Generate an output grid consisting of a single row with `N` columns.
5.  Fill every pixel in this output row with the non-white color identified in step 2.
