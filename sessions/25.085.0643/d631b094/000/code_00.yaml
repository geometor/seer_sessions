task_description: Extracts non-white pixels from the input grid and represents their count and color in a single-row output grid.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    description: A 2D array containing pixels.
    properties:
      - Contains mostly white (0) pixels.
      - Contains a set of pixels of a single non-white color.
  - element: non_white_pixels
    description: Pixels in the input grid that are not white (value > 0).
    properties:
      - All share the same color within a single input grid.
      - Their count is variable.
      - Their positions within the input grid vary.
  - element: output_grid
    description: A 2D array representing the result.
    properties:
      - Always has a height of 1.
      - Width equals the count of non_white_pixels in the input_grid.
      - All pixels have the same color, matching the color of the non_white_pixels in the input_grid.

relationships:
  - relation: count_matches_width
    description: The number of non_white_pixels in the input_grid determines the width of the output_grid.
  - relation: color_preservation
    description: The color of the non_white_pixels in the input_grid determines the color of all pixels in the output_grid.

actions:
  - action: identify_non_white
    description: Find all pixels in the input_grid with a value greater than 0.
  - action: determine_color
    description: Identify the color of the non_white_pixels (assuming only one non-white color exists).
  - action: count_pixels
    description: Count the total number of non_white_pixels identified.
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create a new grid with 1 row and N columns (where N is the count from count_pixels), filling it entirely with the color determined by determine_color.
