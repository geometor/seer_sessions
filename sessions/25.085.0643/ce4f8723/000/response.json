The yellow separator line has the same width but a height of 1.\n4.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Blue (1) and Red (2) in the input seem to relate to Green (3) in the output.\n    *   White (0) in the input relates to White (0) in the output under specific conditions.\n    *   Yellow (4) acts solely as a separator and does not directly contribute to the output grid's pixel values.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** By comparing the pixel values at corresponding positions in the top and bottom input sections with the output grid, a clear pattern emerges. It appears to be a pixel-wise combination based on a logical OR operation. If a pixel is colored (non-white) in *either* the top section (blue) *or* the bottom section (red), the corresponding output pixel becomes green. If *both* corresponding pixels in the input sections are white, the output pixel remains white.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
