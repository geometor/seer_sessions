task_structure:
  - input_grid:
      description: Contains three vertically stacked sections.
      sections:
        - top_grid:
            pixels: [blue (1), white (0)]
            role: Input operand 1
        - separator:
            pixels: [yellow (4)]
            shape: Horizontal line (height 1)
            role: Divides top and bottom grids
        - bottom_grid:
            pixels: [red (2), white (0)]
            role: Input operand 2
      properties:
        - Top and bottom grids have identical dimensions within an example.
  - output_grid:
      description: Result of combining top and bottom input grids.
      pixels: [green (3), white (0)]
      properties:
        - Dimensions match the top and bottom input grids.

transformation:
  type: pixel-wise_combination
  operation: logical_OR_equivalent
  mapping:
    - condition: Pixel at (row, col) in top_grid is blue (1) OR pixel at (row, col) in bottom_grid is red (2).
      output_pixel: green (3)
    - condition: Pixel at (row, col) in top_grid is white (0) AND pixel at (row, col) in bottom_grid is white (0).
      output_pixel: white (0)
  inputs: [top_grid, bottom_grid]
  output: output_grid
