Okay, let's break down this ARC task.

## Perception

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid is composed of three distinct sections stacked vertically:
    *   A top section containing blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
    *   A middle section consisting of a single horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels, acting as a separator.
    *   A bottom section containing red (2) and white (0) pixels.
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid contains only green (3) and white (0) pixels.
3.  **Dimensionality:** The top section of the input grid, the bottom section of the input grid, and the output grid all share the same dimensions (height and width) within each example pair. The yellow separator line has the same width but a height of 1.
4.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Blue (1) and Red (2) in the input seem to relate to Green (3) in the output.
    *   White (0) in the input relates to White (0) in the output under specific conditions.
    *   Yellow (4) acts solely as a separator and does not directly contribute to the output grid's pixel values.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** By comparing the pixel values at corresponding positions in the top and bottom input sections with the output grid, a clear pattern emerges. It appears to be a pixel-wise combination based on a logical OR operation. If a pixel is colored (non-white) in *either* the top section (blue) *or* the bottom section (red), the corresponding output pixel becomes green. If *both* corresponding pixels in the input sections are white, the output pixel remains white.

transformation:
  type: pixel-wise_combination
  operation: logical_OR_equivalent
  mapping:
    - condition: Pixel at (row, col) in top_grid is blue (1) OR pixel at (row, col) in bottom_grid is red (2).
      output_pixel: green (3)
    - condition: Pixel at (row, col) in top_grid is white (0) AND pixel at (row, col) in bottom_grid is white (0).
      output_pixel: white (0)
  inputs: [top_grid, bottom_grid]
  output: output_grid

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the horizontal row composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels within the input grid. This row serves as a separator.
2.  Extract the subgrid located above the yellow separator row (let's call this `top_grid`).
3.  Extract the subgrid located below the yellow separator row (let's call this `bottom_grid`). Note that `top_grid` and `bottom_grid` will have the same dimensions.
4.  Create a new grid (the `output_grid`) with the same dimensions as `top_grid` and `bottom_grid`, initially filled with white (0) pixels.
5.  Iterate through each pixel position (row `r`, column `c`) from `(0, 0)` up to the dimensions of the `top_grid` / `bottom_grid`.
6.  For each position `(r, c)`:
    *   Check the color of the pixel at `top_grid[r][c]` and `bottom_grid[r][c]`.
    *   If the pixel in `top_grid` is blue (1) **or** the pixel in `bottom_grid` is red (2), set the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` to green (3).
    *   Otherwise (meaning both pixels are white (0)), leave the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` as white (0).
7.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
