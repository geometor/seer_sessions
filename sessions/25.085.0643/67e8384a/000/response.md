*   **Perception:** The task involves taking a small input grid (3x3 in the examples) and transforming it into a larger output grid (6x6 in the examples). The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging four copies of the input grid, each potentially transformed by flipping. Specifically, the output grid is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. The top-left quadrant matches the input, the top-right is a horizontal flip, the bottom-left is a vertical flip, and the bottom-right is flipped both horizontally and vertically.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with height 2*H and width 2*W.
    3.  Copy the original input grid into the top-left quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    4.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid.
    5.  Copy the horizontally flipped grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
    6.  Create a vertically flipped version of the input grid.
    7.  Copy the vertically flipped grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2*H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    8.  Create a version of the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically.
    9.  Copy the doubly flipped grid into the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2*H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
    10. Return the constructed output grid.
