elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell within the grid, having a color attribute.

  - attribute: color
    description: An integer value from 0 to 9 representing the pixel's color. Specific colors involved are orange (7), gray (5), blue (1), and azure (8).
transformations:
  - transformation: color_substitution
    input_pixels: pixels with color orange (7)
    output_pixels: pixels with color gray (5)
    condition: Applies to every pixel in the grid.
    unchanged_pixels: All pixels not matching the input condition (i.e., pixels that are not orange).
relationships:
  - relationship: pixel_wise_operation
    description: The transformation operates on each pixel independently based solely on its color value. The position or neighborhood of the pixel does not influence the transformation.
grid_properties:
  - property: dimensions
    value: Unchanged between input and output.
