Specifically, every pixel with the color orange (value 7) in the input grid is changed to the color gray (value 5) in the output grid.\n2.  **Other Colors Unchanged:** All pixels with colors other than orange (7) retain their original color in the output grid. In the examples, pixels with blue (1) and azure (8) remain unchanged.\n3.  **Grid Dimensions:** The height and width of the grid remain the same between input and output.\n4.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative positions of all pixels are preserved; only the color value of specific pixels (those that were orange) is altered.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
