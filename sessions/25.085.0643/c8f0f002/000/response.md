## Perception

The input and output are grids of pixels with different colors.
Comparing the input and output grids across all three training examples, I observe the following:

1.  **Color Change:** The primary difference between the input and output grids is a consistent color substitution. Specifically, every pixel with the color orange (value 7) in the input grid is changed to the color gray (value 5) in the output grid.
2.  **Other Colors Unchanged:** All pixels with colors other than orange (7) retain their original color in the output grid. In the examples, pixels with blue (1) and azure (8) remain unchanged.
3.  **Grid Dimensions:** The height and width of the grid remain the same between input and output.
4.  **Structure Preservation:** The relative positions of all pixels are preserved; only the color value of specific pixels (those that were orange) is altered.

## Facts


```yaml
elements:
  - element: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
  - element: pixel
    description: An individual cell within the grid, having a color attribute.
attributes:
  - attribute: color
    description: An integer value from 0 to 9 representing the pixel's color. Specific colors involved are orange (7), gray (5), blue (1), and azure (8).
transformations:
  - transformation: color_substitution
    input_pixels: pixels with color orange (7)
    output_pixels: pixels with color gray (5)
    condition: Applies to every pixel in the grid.
    unchanged_pixels: All pixels not matching the input condition (i.e., pixels that are not orange).
relationships:
  - relationship: pixel_wise_operation
    description: The transformation operates on each pixel independently based solely on its color value. The position or neighborhood of the pixel does not influence the transformation.
grid_properties:
  - property: dimensions
    value: Unchanged between input and output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
3.  For each pixel, check its color:
    *   If the pixel's color is orange (7), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to gray (5).
    *   If the pixel's color is not orange (7), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the new grid to the same color as the input pixel.
4.  The new grid is the output.
