They land on the bottom row (row 4), replacing the gray pixel that was originally in that column. The original position of the blue pixel in row 2 becomes white. The gray pixels in row 3 act as static obstacles and are unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Change the pixel at the bottom row in the same column, position `(H-1, col)`, in the output grid to blue (1).\n6.  Ensure all other pixels copied from the input remain unchanged unless modified by step 5.\n7.  Return the modified grid as the output."
