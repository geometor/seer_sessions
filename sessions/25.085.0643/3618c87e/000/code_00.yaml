Grid:
  - Size: 5x5 (consistent across examples)
  - BackgroundColor: white (0)

Objects:
  - Type: PixelCluster
    Color: blue (1)
    Location: Found only in row 2 in the input.
    Properties: Seems to represent movable objects.
  - Type: PixelCluster
    Color: gray (5)
    Location: Found in row 3 and row 4 in the input.
    Properties:
      - Pixels in row 3 appear static/unchanged.
      - Pixels in row 4 form a solid base line.

Relationships:
  - VerticalAlignment: Input blue pixels (1) in row 2 are always directly above gray pixels (5) in row 3.
  - TransformationSource: Blue pixels (1) in row 2.
  - TransformationTarget: Gray pixels (5) in row 4, specifically those in the same column as the source blue pixels.

Actions:
  - Move: Blue pixels effectively move from their original position (row 2, col X) to the bottom row (row 4, col X).
  - Replace:
    - The destination pixel on the bottom row changes from gray (5) to blue (1).
    - The original position of the blue pixel changes from blue (1) to white (0).
  - Preserve: Gray pixels in row 3 remain unchanged.

Result:
  - Rows 0, 1, 2 become entirely white (0).
  - Row 3 remains identical to the input's row 3.
  - Row 4 is mostly gray (5), except where blue pixels have 'landed', changing those specific cells to blue (1).
