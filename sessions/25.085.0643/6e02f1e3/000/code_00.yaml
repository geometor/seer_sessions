InputGrid:
  Type: Object
  Properties:
    - Size: 3x3 (fixed for all examples)
    - Pixels: Contains integer values representing colors (green, yellow, red observed).
OutputGrid:
  Type: Object
  Properties:
    - Size: 3x3 (fixed for all examples)
    - Pixels: Contains only gray (5) and white (0).
    - GrayPixelCount: Exactly 3.
    - WhitePixelCount: Exactly 6.
Transformation:
  Type: Action
  Input: InputGrid
  Output: OutputGrid
  Rule: Determined by color frequency analysis of the InputGrid.
ColorFrequency:
  Type: Property (derived from InputGrid)
  Description: Count of each distinct color within the InputGrid.
MajorityColorAnalysis:
  Type: Condition
  Input: ColorFrequency
  Checks:
    - Identify color(s) with the maximum frequency.
    - Check if there is a single majority color or a tie.
    - Check if the single majority color occupies the entire 3x3 grid (frequency = 9).
OutputPatterns:
  Type: State
  States:
    - TopRowGray: [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    - MainDiagonalGray: [[5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]
    - AntiDiagonalGray: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
  SelectionLogic:
    - If a single color occupies the entire InputGrid (frequency=9): Use TopRowGray.
    - If multiple colors tie for the maximum frequency: Use AntiDiagonalGray.
    - If a single color has the maximum frequency, but does not occupy the entire grid (frequency < 9): Use MainDiagonalGray.
