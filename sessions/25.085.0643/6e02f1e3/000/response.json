There appear to be three distinct patterns for the gray pixels:\n    *   Top row: `[[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (Examples 1, 3)\n    *   Main diagonal: `[[5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]` (Examples 4, 5)\n    *   Anti-diagonal: `[[0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]]` (Example 2)\n5.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The key seems to be determining which of the three output patterns to use based on the color distribution within the input grid. Specifically, the frequency of colors in the input dictates the output pattern.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
