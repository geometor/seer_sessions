Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** All examples use 3x3 input grids and produce 3x3 output grids.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Inputs use various colors: green (3), yellow (4), red (2).
    *   Outputs consistently use only gray (5) and white (0).
3.  **Output Structure:** Each output grid contains exactly three gray (5) pixels and six white (0) pixels.
4.  **Pattern Variation:** The placement of the three gray pixels in the output changes based on the input grid's composition. There appear to be three distinct patterns for the gray pixels:
    *   Top row: `[[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (Examples 1, 3)
    *   Main diagonal: `[[5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]` (Examples 4, 5)
    *   Anti-diagonal: `[[0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]]` (Example 2)
5.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The key seems to be determining which of the three output patterns to use based on the color distribution within the input grid. Specifically, the frequency of colors in the input dictates the output pattern.

**Facts:**


```yaml
InputGrid:
  Type: Object
  Properties:
    - Size: 3x3 (fixed for all examples)
    - Pixels: Contains integer values representing colors (green, yellow, red observed).
OutputGrid:
  Type: Object
  Properties:
    - Size: 3x3 (fixed for all examples)
    - Pixels: Contains only gray (5) and white (0).
    - GrayPixelCount: Exactly 3.
    - WhitePixelCount: Exactly 6.
Transformation:
  Type: Action
  Input: InputGrid
  Output: OutputGrid
  Rule: Determined by color frequency analysis of the InputGrid.
ColorFrequency:
  Type: Property (derived from InputGrid)
  Description: Count of each distinct color within the InputGrid.
MajorityColorAnalysis:
  Type: Condition
  Input: ColorFrequency
  Checks:
    - Identify color(s) with the maximum frequency.
    - Check if there is a single majority color or a tie.
    - Check if the single majority color occupies the entire 3x3 grid (frequency = 9).
OutputPatterns:
  Type: State
  States:
    - TopRowGray: [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    - MainDiagonalGray: [[5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5]]
    - AntiDiagonalGray: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
  SelectionLogic:
    - If a single color occupies the entire InputGrid (frequency=9): Use TopRowGray.
    - If multiple colors tie for the maximum frequency: Use AntiDiagonalGray.
    - If a single color has the maximum frequency, but does not occupy the entire grid (frequency < 9): Use MainDiagonalGray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 3x3 output grid, initially filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
2.  Analyze the input 3x3 grid: Count the occurrences of each distinct color present.
3.  Identify the color (or colors) that appear most frequently (the majority or plurality color(s)). Let the maximum frequency be `max_freq`.
4.  Determine the output pattern based on the following conditions:
    a.  **Condition 1:** If there is only *one* color with the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) AND this frequency is 9 (meaning the input grid is monochrome): Set the pixels in the *top row* (row 0, columns 0, 1, 2) of the output grid to gray (5).
    b.  **Condition 2:** If there are *multiple* colors tied for the maximum frequency (`max_freq`): Set the pixels along the *anti-diagonal* (positions [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]) of the output grid to gray (5).
    c.  **Condition 3:** If there is only *one* color with the maximum frequency (`max_freq`) AND this frequency is less than 9: Set the pixels along the *main diagonal* (positions [0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]) of the output grid to gray (5).
5.  Return the modified output grid.
