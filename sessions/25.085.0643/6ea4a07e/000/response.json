            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and derive the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** All examples use 3x3 grids for both input and output.\n*   **Color Palette:** Each input grid contains exactly two colors: white (0) and one other specific color (gray-5, azure-8, or green-3). Each output grid also contains exactly two colors: white (0) and one other specific color (yellow-4, red-2, or blue-1).\n*   **Objects:** The non-white pixels in the input grids form various simple shapes or patterns. The non-white pixels in the output grids also form shapes, which appear to be the negative image or inverse of the input shapes within the grid boundaries.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve swapping the roles of the two colors present in the input. Pixels that were non-white in the input become white in the output. Pixels that were white in the input become a new non-white color in the output.\n*   **Color Mapping:** There's a specific mapping rule between the non-white input color and the non-white output color:\n    *   Gray (5) in input maps to Yellow (4) in output.\n    *   Azure (8) in input maps to Red (2) in output.\n    *   Green (3) in input maps to Blue (1) in output.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Iterate through each cell (`pixel`) of the input grid at coordinates (row, column).\n5.  For each `pixel`:\n    *   If the color of the `pixel` is equal to `input_color`, set the color of the cell at (row, column) in the output grid to white (0).\n    *   If the color of the `pixel` is white (0), set the color of the cell at (row, column) in the output grid to `output_color`.\n6.
