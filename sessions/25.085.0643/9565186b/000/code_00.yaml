task_type: color_transformation
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: true # Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - dimensions: 3x3 # Observed dimensions in examples.
color_mapping:
  target_color: gray (5) # The color used for replacement.
rule_components:
  - component: frequency_analysis
    description: The transformation depends on the frequency of colors in the input grid.
    details:
      - Identify all non-background (non-0) colors present.
      - Count occurrences of each color.
      - Determine the color with the maximum frequency count. This is the 'protected_color'.
      - Assumption: Ties are broken by choosing the color with the lower numerical value (though no ties observed in examples).
  - component: pixel_replacement
    description: Pixels are replaced based on whether they match the 'protected_color'.
    details:
      - Input pixels matching the 'protected_color' retain their color in the output.
      - All other input pixels are changed to the 'target_color' (gray, 5) in the output.
objects:
  - type: pixels
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - location (row, column)
    actions:
      - identify_color
      - count_frequency
      - check_if_protected
      - change_color (to gray/5)
relationships:
  - type: frequency
    description: The frequency of a color determines if it is protected from transformation.
  - type: identity
    description: Pixels matching the most frequent color maintain their identity.
  - type: transformation
    description: Pixels not matching the most frequent color are transformed to gray (5).
