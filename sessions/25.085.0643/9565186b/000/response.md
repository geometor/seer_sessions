Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 3x3. The size remains constant.
2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are red (2), azure (8), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), and gray (5). White (0) is not present in these examples.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** In each example, some pixels in the input grid change their color to gray (5) in the output grid, while others retain their original color.
4.  **Identifying the Unchanged Color:** By comparing inputs and outputs, we can see which color persists:
    *   Example 1: Red (2) pixels remain red (2). Azure (8) pixels change to gray (5).
    *   Example 2: Blue (1) pixels remain blue (1). Azure (8), green (3), and red (2) pixels change to gray (5).
    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) pixels remain yellow (4). Green (3), azure (8), and blue (1) pixels change to gray (5).
    *   Example 4: Red (2) pixels remain red (2). Blue (1) and azure (8) pixels change to gray (5).
5.  **Rule Discovery:** The color that *remains unchanged* in each example appears to be the color that occurs most frequently in the input grid (excluding background colors like white/0, although none are present here).
    *   Example 1: Red (7 occurrences) vs Azure (2 occurrences). Red persists.
    *   Example 2: Blue (4) vs Azure (2), Red (2), Green (1). Blue persists.
    *   Example 3: Yellow (3) vs Green (2), Azure (2), Blue (2). Yellow persists.
    *   Example 4: Red (4) vs Azure (3), Blue (1). Red persists.
6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies the most frequent non-background color in the input grid. All pixels of this color retain their value. All other pixels (regardless of their original color) are changed to gray (5).

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: color_transformation
grid_properties:
  - size_preservation: true # Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - dimensions: 3x3 # Observed dimensions in examples.
color_mapping:
  target_color: gray (5) # The color used for replacement.
rule_components:
  - component: frequency_analysis
    description: The transformation depends on the frequency of colors in the input grid.
    details:
      - Identify all non-background (non-0) colors present.
      - Count occurrences of each color.
      - Determine the color with the maximum frequency count. This is the 'protected_color'.
      - Assumption: Ties are broken by choosing the color with the lower numerical value (though no ties observed in examples).
  - component: pixel_replacement
    description: Pixels are replaced based on whether they match the 'protected_color'.
    details:
      - Input pixels matching the 'protected_color' retain their color in the output.
      - All other input pixels are changed to the 'target_color' (gray, 5) in the output.
objects:
  - type: pixels
    properties:
      - color (value 0-9)
      - location (row, column)
    actions:
      - identify_color
      - count_frequency
      - check_if_protected
      - change_color (to gray/5)
relationships:
  - type: frequency
    description: The frequency of a color determines if it is protected from transformation.
  - type: identity
    description: Pixels matching the most frequent color maintain their identity.
  - type: transformation
    description: Pixels not matching the most frequent color are transformed to gray (5).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid and identify all unique colors present, excluding white (0).
2.  Count the number of occurrences (frequency) of each unique non-white color.
3.  Find the color that has the highest frequency. If there is a tie for the highest frequency, select the color with the lowest numerical value among the tied colors. This color is the "protected color".
4.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid:
    a.  If the color of the current input pixel is the "protected color", copy this color to the corresponding position in the new grid.
    b.  If the color of the current input pixel is *not* the "protected color", set the color of the corresponding position in the new grid to gray (5).
6.  The new grid is the output.
