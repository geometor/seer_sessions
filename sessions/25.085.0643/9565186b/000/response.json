            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Size:** All input and output grids are 3x3. The size remains constant.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The colors involved are red (2), azure (8), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), and gray (5). White (0) is not present in these examples.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** In each example, some pixels in the input grid change their color to gray (5) in the output grid, while others retain their original color.\n4.  **Identifying the Unchanged Color:** By comparing inputs and outputs, we can see which color persists:\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) pixels remain red (2). Azure (8) pixels change to gray (5).\n    *   Example 2: Blue (1) pixels remain blue (1). Azure (8), green (3), and red (2) pixels change to gray (5).\n    *   Example 3: Yellow (4) pixels remain yellow (4). Green (3), azure (8), and blue (1) pixels change to gray (5).\n    *   Example 4: Red (2) pixels remain red (2). Blue (1) and azure (8) pixels change to gray (5).\n5.  **Rule Discovery:** The color that *remains unchanged* in each example appears to be the color that occurs most frequently in the input grid (excluding background colors like white/0, although none are present here).\n    *   Example 1: Red (7 occurrences) vs Azure (2 occurrences). Red persists.\n    *   Example 2: Blue (4) vs Azure (2), Red (2), Green (1). Blue persists.\n    *   Example 3: Yellow (3) vs Green (2), Azure (2), Blue (2). Yellow persists.\n    *   Example 4: Red (4) vs Azure (3), Blue (1). Red persists.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The transformation identifies the most frequent non-background color in the input grid. All pixels of this color retain their value. All other pixels (regardless of their original color) are changed to gray (5).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
