task_description: Generate an output grid by stacking the input grid on top of its vertical reflection.
elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 3
      width: 3
  - element: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 6
      width: 3
relationship:
  - type: composition
    description: The output grid is composed of two parts vertically stacked.
    part_1:
      source: input_grid
      location: top half (rows 1-3)
      transformation: identity (copy)
    part_2:
      source: input_grid
      location: bottom half (rows 4-6)
      transformation: vertical_reflection
actions:
  - action: copy
    source: input_grid
    target: top half of output_grid
  - action: reflect
    source: input_grid
    axis: horizontal (reflecting rows vertically)
    target: reflected_grid
  - action: concatenate
    direction: vertical
    grid_1: copied input_grid
    grid_2: reflected_grid
    target: output_grid
