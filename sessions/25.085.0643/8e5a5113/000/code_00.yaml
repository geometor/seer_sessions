  - objects:
      - name: LeftSubgrid
        location: Input, columns left of the first separator
        properties: Contains the pattern to be transformed.
      - name: MiddleSubgrid_Input
        location: Input, columns between the separators
        properties: Uniformly white (0).
      - name: RightSubgrid_Input
        location: Input, columns right of the second separator
        properties: Uniformly white (0).
      - name: SeparatorLines
        location: Input and Output, specific columns (e.g., 3 and 7)
        properties: Vertical, color gray (5).
      - name: OutputGrid
        location: Output
        properties: Same dimensions as InputGrid, contains transformed content.
  - relationships_and_actions:
      - rule: OutputLeft = InputLeft
        action: Copy
        description: The content of the LeftSubgrid from the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output.
      - rule: OutputMiddle = Rotate90Clockwise(InputLeft)
        action: Rotate
        details: The content of the LeftSubgrid from the input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
        placement: Placed in the MiddleSubgrid position of the output.
      - rule: OutputRight = Rotate180(InputLeft)
        action: Rotate
        details: The content of the LeftSubgrid from the input is rotated 180 degrees.
        placement: Placed in the RightSubgrid position of the output.
      - rule: OutputSeparators = InputSeparators
        action: Copy
        description: The gray SeparatorLines are preserved in their original positions in the output.
