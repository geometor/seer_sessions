Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** Both input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11 in the examples).
2.  **Separators:** There are two consistent vertical lines of gray pixels (color 5) in both input and output grids. These lines appear at columns 3 and 7 in the examples.
3.  **Subgrids:** These gray lines effectively partition the grid into three distinct 3x3 square subgrids:
    *   **Left Subgrid:** Columns 0-2. Contains various colored pixels in the input.
    *   **Middle Subgrid:** Columns 4-6. Contains only white pixels (color 0) in the input.
    *   **Right Subgrid:** Columns 8-10. Contains only white pixels (color 0) in the input.
4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation seems to involve the left input subgrid, as the middle and right input subgrids are consistently white. The output grid's middle and right subgrids are populated based on transformations applied to the left input subgrid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the vertical gray separator lines (color 5) in the input grid. Record their column indices.
2.  These separators divide the input grid into three subgrids: Left, Middle, and Right. Extract the Left subgrid (the part before the first separator).
3.  Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  Copy the gray separator lines from the input to the same column indices in the output grid.
5.  Copy the extracted Left input subgrid directly into the Left subgrid area of the output grid (columns before the first separator).
6.  Rotate the extracted Left input subgrid 90 degrees clockwise. Place this rotated version into the Middle subgrid area of the output grid (columns between the two separators).
7.  Rotate the extracted Left input subgrid 180 degrees. Place this rotated version into the Right subgrid area of the output grid (columns after the second separator).
8.  The resulting grid is the final output.
