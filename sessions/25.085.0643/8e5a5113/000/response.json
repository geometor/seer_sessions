These lines appear at columns 3 and 7 in the examples.\n3.  **Subgrids:** These gray lines effectively partition the grid into three distinct 3x3 square subgrids:\n    *   **Left Subgrid:** Columns 0-2. Contains various colored pixels in the input.\n    *   **Middle Subgrid:** Columns 4-6. Contains only white pixels (color 0) in the input.\n    *   **Right Subgrid:** Columns 8-10. Contains only white pixels (color 0) in the input.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation seems to involve the left input subgrid, as the middle and right input subgrids are consistently white. The output grid's middle and right subgrids are populated based on transformations applied to the left input subgrid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
