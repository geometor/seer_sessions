In this case, we have three L-shaped structures.\n\n2.  **Action - Change single cell color:** For each azure object, the corner cell that forms the corner furthest away from all other shapes is recolored to blue (1).\n\nThe program remains the same as in the first example. The only difference is that there are three L shaped objects in the second input grid, instead of two. The transformation rule, correctly, transforms the corner of each azure object that is furthest away from the other objects to blue.\n"
