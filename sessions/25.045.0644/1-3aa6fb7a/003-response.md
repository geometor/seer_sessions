**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify '8'-objects:** Find all connected regions of cells with color '8' in the input grid. Consider each connected region as a distinct object.
2. **Order Objects:** Order the identified '8'-objects based on their discovery order during a typical connected component finding algorithm (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan).
3. **Iterate through '8'-objects:** For each '8'-object in the determined order:
    a. **Find Top-Left Cell:** Locate the top-left most cell within the current '8'-object.
    b. **Cycle Directions:** Use a cyclic sequence of directions: right, down, left, up.
    c. **Attempt Modification with Directions:** For each direction in the cycle, starting with right for the first object, down for the second, left for the third, up for the fourth, and then repeating the cycle:
        - Check the cell immediately adjacent to the top-left cell in the current direction.
        - If this adjacent cell is within the grid boundaries and its current color is '0', change its color to '1'.
        - Once a cell is successfully changed to '1', stop attempting further directions for the current '8'-object and proceed to the next '8'-object in the sequence.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle"
transformation_rule: "Modify cells adjacent to connected '8' regions in a cyclic direction pattern."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8
    properties:
      - "connectivity"
      - "top-left most cell"
      - "discovery order"
actions:
  - action_type: "change_color"
    target_object: "cell adjacent to '8'-object's top-left cell"
    new_color: 1
    conditions:
      - "target cell is within grid boundaries"
      - "target cell's original color is 0"
transformation_steps:
  - "Identify and order connected regions of color '8'."
  - "For each region, find the top-left most cell."
  - "Apply cyclic directions (right, down, left, up) based on the region's order."
  - "For each direction, check the adjacent cell; if valid and color '0', change to '1' and proceed to the next region."
