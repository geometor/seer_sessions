task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle"
transformation_rule: "Modify cells adjacent to connected '8' regions in a cyclic direction pattern."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8
    properties:
      - "connectivity"
      - "top-left most cell"
      - "discovery order"
actions:
  - action_type: "change_color"
    target_object: "cell adjacent to '8'-object's top-left cell"
    new_color: 1
    conditions:
      - "target cell is within grid boundaries"
      - "target cell's original color is 0"
transformation_steps:
  - "Identify and order connected regions of color '8'."
  - "For each region, find the top-left most cell."
  - "Apply cyclic directions (right, down, left, up) based on the region's order."
  - "For each direction, check the adjacent cell; if valid and color '0', change to '1' and proceed to the next region."
