**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify '8'-objects:** Find all connected regions of cells with color '8' in the input grid. We can consider these as distinct objects.
2. **Locate Top-Left Cell:** For each '8'-object, determine its "top-left most" cell. This is the cell within the object with the smallest row index, and among those with the smallest row index, the smallest column index.
3. **Sequential Modification:**
    - For the *first* '8'-object identified:  Examine the cell immediately to the right of its top-left cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is '0', change its color to '1'.
    - For the *second* '8'-object identified: Examine the cell immediately below its top-left cell. If this cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is '0', change its color to '1'.

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
task_context: "ARC-AGI grid puzzle"
transformation_rule: "Modify cells adjacent to connected '8' regions."
objects:
  - type: "connected region"
    color: 8
    properties:
      - "connectivity"
      - "top-left most cell"
actions:
  - action_type: "change_color"
    target_object: "cell adjacent to '8'-object's top-left cell"
    new_color: 1
    conditions:
      - "target cell is within grid boundaries"
      - "target cell's original color is 0"
transformation_steps:
  - "Identify connected regions of color '8'."
  - "For each region, find the top-left most cell."
  - "For the first region, change the cell to the right of its top-left cell to '1' if possible."
  - "For the second region, change the cell below its top-left cell to '1' if possible."
```
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

    expected_output = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
