For each cell in the grid, we check if it's currently color 0 (white). If it is, we then examine the cell immediately to its right. If the cell to the right exists within the grid boundaries and is color 8, we change the current cell's color to 1 (blue).  If these conditions are not met, the cell's color remains unchanged. This process is applied to every cell in the grid, resulting in the output grid.\n\n"
