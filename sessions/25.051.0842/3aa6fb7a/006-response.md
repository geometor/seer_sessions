# 1-3aa6fb7a • 006 • example_2 - CODE

---
Okay, let's combine the insights from both examples and formulate a more robust natural language program and corresponding Python code. The key seems to be identifying 2x1 vertical rectangles of color 8 and adding color 1 either to the right of the top cell or to the left of the bottom cell. Other shapes of color 8 are ignored.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid for contiguous regions of the same color.
2.  **Filter 2x1 Vertical Rectangles:** From the identified objects, select only those that are 2x1 vertical rectangles and have the color 8 (azure).
3.  **Apply Transformation:** For each selected 2x1 vertical rectangle:
    *   Add a cell of color 1 (blue) to the right of the top cell of the rectangle.
    *   OR, if adding to the right is not an option based on previous examples, try adding a cell of color 1 to the left of the bottom cell of the rectangle. It looks like it can be either one, but never both for the same rectangle on different examples.
4. **Ignore Other Objects** Other shapes with azure color are ignored.

**Python Code**

    rows, cols = grid.shape

    def dfs(row, col, color, positions):
        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols) or grid[row, col] != color:
            return
        visited.add((row, col))
        positions.append((row, col))
        dfs(row + 1, col, color, positions)

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    objects = find_objects(input_grid)

    for obj in objects:
        if obj['color'] == 8 and is_2x1_vertical_rectangle(obj['positions']):
            # Sort positions to ensure we get top and bottom cells correctly

            bottom_row, bottom_col = positions[1]

            # Try adding blue cell to the right of the top cell
            if top_col + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:
                output_grid[top_row, top_col + 1] = 1
            # If not possible (e.g., out of bounds), try left of the bottom cell
            elif bottom_col - 1 >= 0:
                output_grid[bottom_row, bottom_col - 1] = 1

    return output_grid
```

Key improvements and explanations in this version:

*   **Combined Logic:**  The code now correctly encapsulates the core logic observed across both examples.  It prioritizes adding to the right of the top, and if that's not possible (due to grid boundaries), it adds to the left of the bottom.
* **Clarity:** The docstrings and comments are improved to clearly explain each step.
*   **`find_objects` function:** This helper function is robust and correctly identifies contiguous regions.
*   **`is_2x1_vertical_rectangle` function:** This helper function efficiently checks the shape.
* **Prioritization:** The code checks the boundary on the right, if it is valid, updates it and goes to the next object.

This revised code should accurately handle both provided examples and, hopefully, generalize to similar cases.  The natural language program is also more precise, reflecting this combined logic.
