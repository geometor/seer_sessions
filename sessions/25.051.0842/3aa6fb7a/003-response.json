            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program and the Python code.\n\n**Analysis of the Failed Examples**\n\nThe previous code failed because it didn't correctly apply the rule of adding blue cells relative to the 2x1 azure rectangles. It seems there's confusion about \"before\" and \"after,\" and the indexing wasn't precise. Also in the example 2, the described logic is adding the blue cell to the right of the top cell, which is not applied.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's a revised natural language description of the transformation rule:\n\n1. **Identify 2x1 Azure Rectangles:** Find all vertical 2x1 rectangles (objects) of azure color (8) within the input grid.\n\n2. **Add Blue Cells:**  For each identified azure rectangle:\n   -  Find the *top* azure cell. Add a blue cell (1) immediately to the *right* of this top cell.\n   -  Find the *bottom* azure cell. Add a blue cell (1) immediately to the *left* of the bottom cell.\n\n3. **Preserve Other Cells:**  All other cells in the input grid that are not part of the identified 2x1 azure rectangles remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**Revised Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous regions of the same color and returns them as a list of objects.\n    Each object is a dictionary with 'color' and 'positions' (list of (row, col) tuples).\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, positions):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        positions.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, positions)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, positions)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, positions)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, positions)\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if (row, col) not in visited:\n                color = grid[row, col]\n                positions = []\n                dfs(row, col, color, positions)\n                if positions:\n                    objects.append({'color': color, 'positions': positions})\n    return objects\n\ndef is_2x1_vertical_rectangle(positions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given positions form a 2x1 vertical rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(positions) != 2:\n        return False\n    row1, col1 = positions[0]\n    row2, col2 = positions[1]\n    return (col1 == col2) and (abs(row1 - row2) == 1)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    For each 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue (1) cell to the\n    right of its top cell, and to the left of its bottom cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        if obj['color'] == 8 and is_2x1_vertical_rectangle(obj['positions']):\n            # Sort positions to ensure we get top and bottom cells correctly\n            positions = sorted(obj['positions'])\n            top_row, top_col = positions[0]\n            bottom_row, bottom_col = positions[1]\n\n            # Add blue cell to the right of the top cell\n            if top_col + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n                output_grid[top_row, top_col + 1] = 1\n\n            # Add blue cell to the left of the bottom cell\n            if bottom_col - 1 >= 0:\n                output_grid[bottom_row, bottom_col - 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Key Changes and Explanation**\n\n1.  **Corrected Indexing for Blue Cell Addition:** The most critical change is in the `transform` function.  We now correctly add the blue cell to the *right* of the top azure cell (`top_col + 1`) and to the *left* of the bottom azure cell (`bottom_col - 1`). The previous attempts had incorrect or inconsistent logic.\n2.  **Simplified Logic:** No more complicated conditional, because now using the correct left and right indexing.\n3. **No change on find_objects and is_2x1_vertical_rectangle:** The provided functions work as expected.\n4.  **Sorted positions**: Ensure that the positions array is ordered.\n\nThe revised code now accurately implements the refined natural language program, addressing the issues observed in the previous failed attempts. It correctly handles the placement of the blue cells relative to the azure rectangles.\n"
