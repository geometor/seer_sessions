            "text": "Okay, let's combine the insights from both examples and formulate a more robust natural language program and corresponding Python code. The key seems to be identifying 2x1 vertical rectangles of color 8 and adding color 1 either to the right of the top cell or to the left of the bottom cell. Other shapes of color 8 are ignored.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid for contiguous regions of the same color.\n2.  **Filter 2x1 Vertical Rectangles:** From the identified objects, select only those that are 2x1 vertical rectangles and have the color 8 (azure).\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** For each selected 2x1 vertical rectangle:\n    *   Add a cell of color 1 (blue) to the right of the top cell of the rectangle.\n    *   OR, if adding to the right is not an option based on previous examples, try adding a cell of color 1 to the left of the bottom cell of the rectangle. It looks like it can be either one, but never both for the same rectangle on different examples.\n4. **Ignore Other Objects** Other shapes with azure color are ignored.\n\n**Python Code**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule identifies 2x1 vertical rectangles of color 8 (azure) and adds a cell of color 1 (blue) either to the right of the top cell or to the left of the bottom cell.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous regions of the same color and returns them as a list of objects.\n    Each object is a dictionary with 'color' and 'positions' (list of (row, col) tuples).\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, positions):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        positions.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, positions)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, positions)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, positions)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, positions)\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if (row, col) not in visited:\n                color = grid[row, col]\n                positions = []\n                dfs(row, col, color, positions)\n                if positions:\n                    objects.append({'color': color, 'positions': positions})\n    return objects\n\ndef is_2x1_vertical_rectangle(positions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given positions form a 2x1 vertical rectangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(positions) != 2:\n        return False\n    row1, col1 = positions[0]\n    row2, col2 = positions[1]\n    return (col1 == col2) and (abs(row1 - row2) == 1)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the rule:\n    For each 2x1 azure rectangle, add a blue (1) cell either:\n     - to the right of its top cell.\n     - to the left of its bottom cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        if obj['color'] == 8 and is_2x1_vertical_rectangle(obj['positions']):\n            # Sort positions to ensure we get top and bottom cells correctly\n            positions = sorted(obj['positions'])\n            top_row, top_col = positions[0]\n            bottom_row, bottom_col = positions[1]\n\n            # Try adding blue cell to the right of the top cell\n            if top_col + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:\n                output_grid[top_row, top_col + 1] = 1\n            # If not possible (e.g., out of bounds), try left of the bottom cell\n            elif bottom_col - 1 >= 0:\n                output_grid[bottom_row, bottom_col - 1] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations in this version:\n\n*   **Combined Logic:**  The code now correctly encapsulates the core logic observed across both examples.  It prioritizes adding to the right of the top, and if that's not possible (due to grid boundaries), it adds to the left of the bottom.\n* **Clarity:** The docstrings and comments are improved to clearly explain each step.\n*   **`find_objects` function:** This helper function is robust and correctly identifies contiguous regions.\n*   **`is_2x1_vertical_rectangle` function:** This helper function efficiently checks the shape.\n* **Prioritization:** The code checks the boundary on the right, if it is valid, updates it and goes to the next object.\n\nThis revised code should accurately handle both provided examples and, hopefully, generalize to similar cases.  The natural language program is also more precise, reflecting this combined logic.\n"
