"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value '3' (green).
2.  **Check for Adjacency:** For each identified '3' pixel, check if it has any adjacent pixels (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) that also have the value '3'.
3.  **Modify Central Pixels :** If a '3' pixel *has one neighbor*, keep original '3' value.
4.  **Modify Connected Pixels:** If a '3' pixel has more than one horizontal/vertical adjacent pixels with value '3', change its value to '4' (yellow).
5.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the modified pixel values, leaving all other pixels unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies green (3) pixels and checks for adjacent green pixels. However, the logic for changing the pixel value to yellow (4) is flawed. It seems to change a green pixel to yellow if *any* number of adjacent pixels greater than 1 is green, but the actual rule is more nuanced, which explains the discrepancies in examples 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is essential also that any green pixel that is changed to yellow is part of a contiguous object, and not just one pixel.

The strategy to resolve the errors should include the following steps:

1.  **Refine Adjacency Condition:** Instead of simply counting adjacent green pixels, we need to determine how a green pixel is connected to an object.
2.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic after each example and make adjustments as needed.
3. Ensure the program does not perform the replacement if it would "disconnect" any part of the object.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of observations from each example:

*   **Example 1:** The code fails to turn two green pixels, that have more than one neighbor, to yellow.
*   **Example 2:** The code fails to turn one of the green pixels to yellow.
*   **Example 3:** The code incorrectly changes several green pixels in different objects to yellow, and also fails to modify the ones that it should.
*   **Example 4:** The code incorrectly changes almost all green pixels to yellow, including single objects, or pixels on the perimiter of an object, which means it did not consider connectivity.
*   **Example 5:** As with the others, this example shows many errors where single pixels are changed and connected pixels are not.

**YAML Block - Facts and Observations:**

```yaml
task_id: 00d62c1b
observations:
  - object: green_pixel
    properties:
      value: 3
      adjacent_pixels: [list of adjacent pixel values]
      adjacent_green_count: [number of adjacent green pixels]
    actions:
      - change_to_yellow:
          condition: "adjacent_green_count > 1 and forms_part_of_contiguous_block and no_disconnect"
          new_value: 4
      - remain_green:
          condition: "otherwise"
  - general:
    grid_size: varies
    colors_present: [0, 3, 4]
    transformation_rule: "Modify green pixels based on adjacency and connectivity, changing some to yellow"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value '3' (green).

2.  **Check for Adjacency and Connectivity:** For each identified '3' pixel, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right - not diagonally).

3. **Determine Object Membership:** If a green pixel has more than one horizontal/vertical adjacent pixels with value '3', it is considered a candidate for transformation.

4. **Connectivity Test:** Determine if removing any of the connected '3' pixels would "disconnect" the object - leaving any of the green pixels with only one neighbor.

5.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** If a '3' pixel meets both the adjacency and connectivity rule criteria, change the value to 4, ensuring any change of a pixel does not alter connectivity.

6.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the modified pixel values, leaving all other pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
