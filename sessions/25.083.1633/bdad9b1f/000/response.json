Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description of the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (6x6 in both examples).\n*   The grids primarily contain the color black (0), with some instances of azure (8) and red (2).\n*   The azure (8) pixels seem to maintain their position.\n*   The red (2) pixels also mostly maintain their position but something changes in the surroundings.\n*   The biggest noticable differece is the introduction of yellow (4).\n*   The position of yellow looks like a combination of red and azure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
