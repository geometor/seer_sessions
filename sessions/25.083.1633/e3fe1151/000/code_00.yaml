  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - dominant_color: 7

  - name: non_7_pixels
    type: pixel set
    properties:
      - colors: excludes 7
      - locations: variable
      - symmetry:  horizontal and vertical (approximate)

actions:
  - name: substitution
    description: replace select pixels not equaling 7
    context:  only pixels not of color 7 are changed

relationships:
  - type: symmetry
    objects: [non_7_pixels, non_7_pixels]
    description: Non-7 pixels in both input and output maintain an approximate, central-axis reflective symmetry.
