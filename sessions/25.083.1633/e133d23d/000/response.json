This suggests a pixel-by-pixel correspondence or a localized transformation, rather than a global restructuring.\n*   **Consistent Change:** The '4' (yellow) pixels in the input grid are consistently replaced by '2' (red) in the output grid. This is the most obvious and consistent transformation.\n* **Contextual Change**: The environment of the '4' determines if other pixels get changed to '2'.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
