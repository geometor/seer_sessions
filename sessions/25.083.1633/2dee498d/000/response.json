Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe core element appears to be the extraction of a specific portion of the input grid. The input grids seem to consist of repeating patterns of columns, and the output consistently extracts a single instance of that repeating pattern. The dimensions of the output grid's width are a fraction of the input's width. The height appears to remain constant, the width shrinks.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
