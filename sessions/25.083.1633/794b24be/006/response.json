            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided data and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple rule derived from the first training example: replace 1s with 2s, and if a row contains a 2, fill the entire row with 2s. This rule is too simplistic and doesn't accurately capture the nuances of all examples. The main issue is the row expansion logic. It seems the rule should check input rows for '1', not change them to 2, and if present, add a new row of all '2' of length equal to input length. The existing code incorrectly expands rows in the *output* grid, leading to mismatches in many cases. The size of each output is always 3x3.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine input/output/expected triples where mismatches occurred to pinpoint the exact nature of the error. This has already partially been done in the general assessment, but we will confirm.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** Modify the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation, focusing on *when* and *how* row expansion (or lack thereof) should occur. It seems to consider if row contains one or more 1s.\n3.  **Revise Code:** Update the Python code to reflect the refined rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll manually inspect each example, focusing on the row expansion behavior. The code already changes input '1' to output '2'.\n*   All inputs are 3x3 grids.\n*   All outputs have height 3. All output row widths are 3.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on what the code *did* versus what it *should* have done:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 3.\n    *   Expected: Row 1 has a 2.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 3 became all 2s.\n    *  **Error located**: The replacement occurs by rows in input, and the location of 2 in output does not correspond 1-to-1 with the '1' in the input, rather rows with 1 in the input have become 2.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 3.\n    *   Expected: Row 1 all 2s.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 3 became all 2s.\n    *   **Error located**: Same issue.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 3.\n    *   Expected: 2 at index 0,0\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 3 became all 2s.\n    *   **Error located**: Same issue\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 2.\n    *   Expected: first row all 2.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 2 and 3 became all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   Expected: 2 in row 1.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1, 2, and 3 became all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 6:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 2.\n    *   Expected: first row of all 2s.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 2 became all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 7:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 2.\n    *   Expected: first row 2 2 0.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 2 became all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 8:**\n    *   Input has 1s in rows 1 and 2.\n    *   Expected Output: first row 2, 2, 0.\n    *   Code Output: Rows 1 and 2 became all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 9:**\n    *   Input has 1 in row 1.\n    *   Expected: first element is 2.\n    *   Code Output: Row 1 became all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 10:**\n    *   Input has 1 in row 2.\n    *   Expected Output: first row, first element is 2.\n    *   Code output: Row 2 is all 2s.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
