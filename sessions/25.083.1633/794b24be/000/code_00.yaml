facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids contain only 0s and 1s.
  - observation: Output grids contain only 0s and 2s.
  - object: InputGrid, a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - object: OutputGrid, a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - property: InputGrid.cells, values are 0 or 1.
  - property: OutputGrid.cells, values are 0 or 2.
  - action: Replace, certain '1' values in InputGrid with '2' to form OutputGrid.
  - relationship:  The number of replacements appears to prioritize left to right and then top to bottom.
  - relationship: if only one `1` exists in a row, and no prior row exists, then it changes to `2`.
  - relationship: if the first two pixels in a row are `1`, then those become `2`.
  - relationship: if only one `1` exists on the top row, all `1`s are updated.
