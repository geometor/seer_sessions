The transformation seems to involve a vertical reflection or mirroring of the input grid, followed by appending the original input grid below the reflected one, effectively doubling the height of the grid. The core operation appears to be a vertical flip and concatenation.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The flipped grid will appear at the top, and the original input will appear at the bottom.\n\n"
