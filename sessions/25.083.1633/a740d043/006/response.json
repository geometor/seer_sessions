            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on an incomplete understanding of the transformation. It correctly identified the need to represent non-background (non-1) colors and their contiguous nature. However, it failed to grasp the core concept: the output grid is a *compressed representation of each row*, discarding the spatial information within the row, keeping only non-background colors and their order, and, importantly, adjusting the output height. The current code attempts to maintain the input grid's dimensions, which is incorrect. The width and height needs adjustment.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Discard Spatial Information:** The updated logic should not attempt to maintain the input grid's width. Instead, it should focus on extracting the sequence of non-background colors from each row.\n2.  **Adjust output grid shape:** adjust the output grid's height to number of input rows with colors.\n3.  **Refine Color Handling:** Ensure that only non-background colors are considered, and their order of appearance is preserved.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis for now, as tool use within this turn is limited):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Output Shape (Expected): (2, 3)\n    *   Output Shape (Actual): (7, 7)\n    *   Error: Incorrect shape, padding with zeros.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape (Expected): (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape (Actual): (5, 7)\n    *   Error: Incorrect shape, padding with zeros.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 6)\n    *   Output Shape (Expected): (3, 2)\n    *   Output Shape (Actual): (7,6)\n    *   Error: Incorrect shape, padding with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
