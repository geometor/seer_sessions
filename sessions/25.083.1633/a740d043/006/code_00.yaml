  - observation: |
      Non-background pixels form contiguous blocks within each row.
  - observation: |
      The output grid represents each row of the input grid independently.
  - observation: |
      Empty rows (all background) in the input are ignored in the output.
  - observation: |
       Rows with color are kept.
  - observation: |
      The output for a non-empty row contains only the sequence of non-background colors, without spatial information or padding.
  - observation: |
     Output row has non-background color values in order of apperance
  - observation: |
      The output grid's height is equal to the number of non-empty rows in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width is equal to the longest sequence of non-background colors.
