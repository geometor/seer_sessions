facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same number of rows."
  - observation: "Input grid cells with value 1 (blue) are considered background."
  - observation: "Output grid represents contiguous blocks of non-background pixels in each input row."
  - observation: "Each contiguous block in an input row is represented by its color in the output row."
  - observation: "The length of each block in the input is preserved in the output, using the block's color value."
  - observation: "If an input row contains only background pixels (1s), the output row is [0]."
  - observation: "Output rows are padded with 0s to match the width of the input grid."
  - object: "Contiguous Block"
    properties:
      - "Composed of one or more pixels of the same color."
      - "Adjacent pixels must have the same color."
      - "Pixels within the block are not background color (1/blue)"
    actions:
      - "Represented by its color in the output."
      - "Its length is maintained in output representation"
  - object: "Input Row"
    properties:
      - "Can contain background and non-background pixels."
    actions:
      - "Transformed into an output row."
  - object: "Output Row"
      - "Represents the non-background blocks of its corresponding input row."
      - Padded: "Padded with zeros (0) at the end to have the same number of columns as the input."
