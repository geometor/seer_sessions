Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into a smaller grid. The input grids appear to mostly consist of the digit '1' (blue), with a few other digits forming rectangular shapes within the '1's. The output grids seem to be related to these non-'1' regions, potentially extracting or summarizing them. The dimensions of the output are significantly smaller than the input. There's no obvious rotation or mirroring. The key seems to be identifying and isolating the non-1 regions and representing them, possibly in a compressed form.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and mostly filled with '1' (blue).
  - observation: Non-'1' values form contiguous rectangular blocks.
  - observation: Output grids are smaller than input grids.
  - observation: Output grid values correspond to the non-'1' values in the input grid.
  - observation: The output grid seems to represent only non-1 colored pixels in order of apperance
  - object: InputGrid, type: 2D array, values: integers 0-9
  - object: OutputGrid, type: 2D array, values: integers 0-9
  - property: InputGrid.size > OutputGrid.size
  - action: Extract non-'1' regions from InputGrid.
  - action: Create a compressed representation in OutputGrid.
  - relationship: InputGrid values map to OutputGrid values.
  - relationship: The spatial arrangement of non-'1' blocks in InputGrid influences the structure of OutputGrid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-1 Regions:** Scan the input grid and locate all contiguous regions (rectangular blocks) where the cell values are not equal to '1'.
2.  **Extract color values:** For each such area identified find the color of the block
3. **Left to right, top to bottom:** Process each non-1 blocks in order of their position
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output by adding the non-1 color to the result
5.  **Handle empty rows:** Compress empty rows to zeros between values.

Essentially, the program extracts the distinct non-'1' regions and represents their values in order of apperance, accounting for empty rows.
