1.  **Copy Input:** Create a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Color Substitution:** In the copied grid, replace all blue (1) pixels with red (2) pixels.
3. **Set Output Height:** The output grid will always have a height that is the input height + 3, and a width of 3.
4.  **Create Extended Grid:** Create a new grid with the calculated output dimensions (height and width).
5.  **Populate Central Column:** Fill all cells in the second (middle) column of the new grid with red (2).
6. Copy Input to new output grid.
7.  **Extend Third Column:** Fill the remaining cells in the third column, starting from the top, with alternating white (0) and red (2) pixels. Start with white (0) at the top of third column.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The code performs well on Example 2 but has minor errors in Examples 1 and 3. The primary issue seems to be in the alternating pattern extension in the third column. It looks like the code is not consistently alternating between 0 and 2 on the full extent of the added lines. We'll need to ensure the alternating pattern starts and extends correctly.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Metrics:** Double-check the reported metrics (pixels off, size, color palette, color count) using code execution to confirm accuracy.
2.  **Analyze Pattern Extension:** Focus on the logic that extends the third column with the alternating 0 and 2 pattern. The goal is to ensure it starts correctly (after the original input height) and alternates correctly for the added rows.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Revise the program to accurately reflect the corrected logic, paying close attention to the starting point and continuation of the alternating pattern.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution):**

Since I am unable to execute the provided code, the metrics below could not be gathered with code execution.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 3)

    *   Pixels Off: 2 (Manually confirmed by visual inspection of the provided outputs)
    *   Size Correct: True
    *   Color Palette Correct: True
    *   Color Count Correct: True

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 3)

    *   Pixels Off: 0
    *   Size Correct: True
    *   Color Palette Correct: True
    *   Color Count Correct: True

**YAML Facts:**

  - name: input_grid
    type: grid

      - colors: [0, 1]
      - height: variable (6 in examples)
      - width: 3
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2]
      - height: input_grid.height + 3
      - width: 3
actions:
  - name: copy_and_substitute

  - name: extend_height
    description: Create a new grid with height increased by 3 and width of 3.
  - name: fill_middle_column
    description: Fill the entire second column of the new grid with red (2).
  - name: copy_input_rows
    description:  Copy each row from copied input rows, and add to the central column.
  - name: extend_pattern
    description: Fill the third column, start from the row after original copied input, with an alternating pattern of white (0) and red (2), starting with white (0).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy and Substitute:** Create a copy of the input grid. In this copy, change all blue (1) pixels to red (2).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's width is always 3. The output grid's height is the input grid's height plus 3.
3.  **Create New Grid:** Create a new grid with the calculated output dimensions, filled initially with black (zeros).
4.  **Fill Middle Column:** Set all pixels in the second (middle) column of the output grid to red (2).
5.  **Copy and Overwrite:** Copy rows from the copied input (with red substitutions), and add to the output grid.
6.  **Extend Third Column Pattern:** In the third column of the *output* grid, starting from the row *immediately following* the copied input rows, fill the remaining cells with an alternating pattern of white (0) and red (2). The pattern *always* starts with white (0).
