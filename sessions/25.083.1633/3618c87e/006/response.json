The strategy is to modify the code to first place all blue and gray pixels on the bottom row, and then, for any column where both blue and gray exist, move the gray pixel one row up.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nI'll use a simplified manual analysis, as the `tool_code` environment here is described as being for \"general python\" and has executed successfully in the provided history, so I do not want to risk problems due to the ARC specific tool.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Blue Pixels: (2,1), (2,3)\n    *   Gray Pixels: (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n    *   Error: Gray pixels in columns with blue pixels (columns 1 and 3) are not moved up one row.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Blue Pixels: (2,2)\n    *   Gray Pixels: (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n    *   Error: Gray pixel in the column with a blue pixel (column 2) is not moved up one row.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Blue Pixels: (2,1), (2,4)\n    *   Gray Pixels: (3,1), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n    *   Error: Gray pixels in columns with blue pixels (columns 1 and 4) are not moved up one row.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
