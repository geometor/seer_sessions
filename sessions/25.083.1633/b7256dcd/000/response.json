The transformation seems to involve identifying specific colors and potentially shifting or replacing them based on their neighbors or positions. There's a sense of pattern recognition and conditional modification. The grids in each pair are the same size. It doesn't seem like new objects are introduced, but parts of existing colored objects are recolored.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
