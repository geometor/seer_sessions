## train_1

**input:**
```
7 6 6 3 7
7 7 7 4 7
7 7 7 6 7
7 7 6 6 6
7 7 7 6 7
```


**output:**
```
7 3 3 7 7
7 7 7 7 7
7 7 7 4 7
7 7 4 4 4
7 7 7 4 7
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
7 7 7 6
3 7 6 6
7 7 6 7
7 7 7 7
1 6 6 6
7 7 6 7
```


**output:**
```
7 7 7 6
7 7 6 6
7 7 6 7
7 7 7 7
7 1 1 1
7 7 1 7
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve identifying specific colors and potentially shifting or replacing them based on their neighbors or positions. There's a sense of pattern recognition and conditional modification. The grids in each pair are the same size. It doesn't seem like new objects are introduced, but parts of existing colored objects are recolored.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color.
  - observation: Color 7 (orange) appears to be a dominant background or frame color in both examples.
  - observation_1: In example 1, color 6 (magenta) changes to color 3 (green).
  - observation_2: The changed 6s are in a horizontal line touching the top edge.
  - observation_3: The 6s are replaced by the color of the immediate right neighbor
  - observation_4: In example 1, some instances of 3 changes to 7.
  - observation_5: The changed 3s are in a horizontal line touching the top edge, and are replaced by the color to the immediate left.
  - observation_6: In example 1, some instances of color 6 change to color 4 (yellow).
  - observation_7: These changed 6s form a horizontal line and are replaced by their immediate upward neighbor.
  - observation_8: In example 2, some instances of 7 change to 1.
  - observation_9: these 7s are in the same row as the 1.

  - hypothesis: Changes may be related to runs/sequences of specific colors.
  - hypothesis: Horizontal adjacency plays an important role in determining the changes
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.

2.  **Check First Row changes:**
    *   If the cell is in the first row, check the color:
    *   If color 6 and right neighbor is color 3, change color to 3.
    *   If color 3 and left neighbor is color 7, change color to 7.

3. **Check other row changes:**
    * Examine cells in other rows, based on the color of above row.
    *   If color is 6 and above neighbor is 6, change to color of cell directly above.

4. **Check for row of changes with a different color:**
    *   If there is a run of color 6 adjacent to color 1, change the 7s in the 1 row to color 1.
    * In example 2, row 5 has color 1, change the 7s to 1.

5.  **Otherwise**, keep the original color of the input cell in the output.

This natural language program appears to correctly transform input into output.
