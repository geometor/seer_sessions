            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw in how they handle the \"stacking\" of non-zero digits. The current implementation iterates through the non-zero digits and places them column-wise, wrapping to the next row when a column is full. This is incorrect. The examples demonstrate a row-wise stacking, where non-zero elements from the input are placed in the last row of the output, filling from left to right, and then moving to the row above only when the current row is full. The order of non-zero digits is preserved as they appear in the input when read row by row, from left to right.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Stacking Logic:** The core issue is the column-wise stacking. We need to modify the natural language program and, subsequently, the code to perform row-wise stacking.\n2.  **Preserve Input Order:** The current logic appears to correctly preserve the input order of the non-zero digits, which is good. We need to make sure this remains true when correcting the stacking.\n3.  **Zero-Padding:**\u00a0The zero-padding of the remaining cells is also currently handled by initializing the output to all zeros, which is efficient.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (using hypothetical `code_execution`):**\n\nI would use `code_execution` to run the provided code against all input examples. The output in the prompt already contains this. Here I will just perform calculations as needed.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Non-zero Input Count: 6\n    *   Non-zero Output Count: 6\n    *    Pixels off: 10\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Non-zero Input Count: 4\n    *   Non-zero Output Count: 4\n    *    Pixels off: 6\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Non-zero Input Count: 5\n    *   Non-zero Output Count: 5\n    *    Pixels off: 5\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
