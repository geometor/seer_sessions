            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code captures the basic idea of moving non-zero pixels to the bottom. However, it makes a crucial error in the order of placement. It seems to extract all non-zero digits first, then place them in the output grid. This loses the original relative positioning *within* each row. The examples demonstrate that the relative order of non-zero elements within each row of the input grid should be maintained in the output. The program needs to reposition non-zero numbers at the bottom, keeping row order.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the \"Pixels Off\" count for each example. This metric highlights the specific locations where the code's output differs from the expected output.\n2.  **Refine Ordering Logic:** The core issue is the preservation of the original order *within* each row. The natural language program and subsequently the code, must be updated to reflect this. Instead of collecting all non-zero pixels at once, we need to process each row of the input and stack its non-zero digits, maintaining their relative order.\n3. **Revised Natural Language Program:** Create a new description which explains that digits are placed in order.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using previous execution results directly, no new `tool_code` needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Pixels Off: 10\n    *   Observation: The code incorrectly reorders digits. '9' from the first row ends up at the bottom, and the '8's and the 4 and 7 from the 5th row are misplaced.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Observation: The '9' from the first row is incorrectly placed. The '1' remains in the 4th row, rather than going to the bottom.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Pixels Off: 5\n    *   Observation: Incorrect ordering. The first row's '1' doesn't stay in its relative order.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Maintain their original order.\n4.  **Reposition:** Place these non-zero digits, in their original order, at the bottom of the output grid, starting from the last row and filling upwards, and filling the row from left to right.
