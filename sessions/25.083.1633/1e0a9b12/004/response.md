Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures the basic idea of moving non-zero pixels to the bottom. However, it makes a crucial error in the order of placement. It seems to extract all non-zero digits first, then place them in the output grid. This loses the original relative positioning *within* each row. The examples demonstrate that the relative order of non-zero elements within each row of the input grid should be maintained in the output. The program needs to reposition non-zero numbers at the bottom, keeping row order.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the "Pixels Off" count for each example. This metric highlights the specific locations where the code's output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Refine Ordering Logic:** The core issue is the preservation of the original order *within* each row. The natural language program and subsequently the code, must be updated to reflect this. Instead of collecting all non-zero pixels at once, we need to process each row of the input and stack its non-zero digits, maintaining their relative order.
3. **Revised Natural Language Program:** Create a new description which explains that digits are placed in order.

**Metrics and Observations (using previous execution results directly, no new `tool_code` needed):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Pixels Off: 10
    *   Observation: The code incorrectly reorders digits. '9' from the first row ends up at the bottom, and the '8's and the 4 and 7 from the 5th row are misplaced.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Pixels Off: 6
    *   Observation: The '9' from the first row is incorrectly placed. The '1' remains in the 4th row, rather than going to the bottom.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Pixels Off: 5
    *   Observation: Incorrect ordering. The first row's '1' doesn't stay in its relative order.

**YAML Fact Block:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
2.  **Row-wise Processing:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  **Identify and Stack (Per Row):**  Within each row, identify the non-zero digits. Maintain their original order.
4.  **Reposition:** Place these non-zero digits, in their original order, at the bottom of the output grid, starting from the last row and filling upwards, and filling the row from left to right. If a row fills when adding digits, move to the row above.
5.  **Fill Remaining:** The remaining cells in the output grid, which were not filled by non-zero digits, remain as zeros (achieved by initialization).

This revised natural language program explicitly describes the per-row processing and the preservation of relative order within each row, addressing the errors observed in the initial code's execution.
