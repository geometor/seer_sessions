The code processes row by row, collecting non-zero digits and placing them at the bottom. It *does* preserve the *within-row* order, but it completely disregards the original column positions. This is why we see mismatches in all three examples. The digits are being \"squashed\" to the bottom-left, rather than preserving their horizontal positions.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to shift the focus from preserving within-row order to *preserving column order*. We need to iterate in a way that prioritizes collecting and placing digits based on their original columns.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence:**\n\nLet's analyze each example in more detail, particularly focusing on the column displacement. I'll create and display simple representations to confirm my reasoning, followed by my YAML and natural language program below.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nInput:\n\n"
