            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies non-zero elements and attempts to reorder them based on their appearance, reading top-to-bottom and left-to-right. However, it seems to have a problem with where it's placing those elements in the output grid. It is filling from the top-left, it looks like, regardless of the layout. It appears it may be overwriting previously written nonzero values. The core issue is that the code *almost* correctly reads and orders the non-zero elements but *incorrectly* places them in the output grid. The transformation logic needs to maintain some positional relationship between non-zero elements and their original locations in the *input*.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Placement Logic:** The current code iterates through the output grid and places non-zero elements sequentially. Instead, it should iterate through the non-zero elements *and* use the stored original location of a non-zero element to determine the placement location in the output.\n2. **Debug Example by Example:** We'll go through each example, track the non-zero elements, their original positions, and where the current code places them. Then, we'll deduce how the correct output placement relates to the input placement.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per Example):**\n\nI'll use the provided outputs in the prompt to construct a summary - no need to do more `tool_code` execution.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n*   Non-zero elements (and original positions): 5 (0,0), 5 (1,1), 6 (2,0), 5 (2,2), 6(3,0), 4(3,2), 5(3,3)\n*   Expected Output: Non-zero values shifted down and to the left (when possible).\n*   Observed Output: Non-zero elements are filled in starting at (0,0) and overwriting values as it goes.\n*   Problem: The output grid is filled with the ordered elements from left-to-right, top to bottom, overwriting where needed.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n*   Non-zero elements: 5 (0,0), 3 (1,0), 5 (1,1), 5 (2,2)\n*    Expected output: values are shifted down and left\n*   Observed Output: Similar issue as Example 1 - filling starting at 0,0\n*   Problem: same as above\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n*   Non-zero elements: 5(0,0), 5(1,1), 8(2,0), 8(2,1), 5(2,2), 2(3,1), 5(3,3), 2(4,1), 1(4,3), 5(4,4)\n*    expected: shift down and left\n*   Observed Output: Similar fill issue.\n*   Problem: same as above.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
