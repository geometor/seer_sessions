    objects: ["non-zero elements"]
    properties:
      value: "not equal to 0"
      location: "row and column index in the input grid"

  - description: "Non-zero elements are reordered."
    type: "action"
    action: "reordering"
    subject: "non-zero elements"
    method: "top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading order of input grid"

  - description: "The output grid is initialized as a zero grid of the same dimensions as the input grid."

    object: "output grid"
    properties:
        initial_value: 0
        shape: "same as input grid"

  - description: "Non-zero elements from input are placed into the output grid, preserving their original order of appearance."
    type: "action"
    action: "placement"
    subject: "non-zero elements"
    destination: "output grid"
    rule: "Elements seem to be shifted down and to the left when possible."

  - observation: "Current code incorrectly fills the output grid sequentially from top-left, overwriting elements, instead of positioning based on a relative shift."
