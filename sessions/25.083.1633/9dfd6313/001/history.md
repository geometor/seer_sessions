Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The value '0' (white) seems to act like a background or empty space.
*   Non-zero values appear to be significant elements, possibly objects.
*   There's a rearrangement of non-zero values between the input and output.
*   The dimensions of the grid can change, sometimes they are the same and sometimes differ.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cells: contain digits 0-9
  - type: element
    properties:
      - value: non-zero digit
      - color: determined by digit value
      - position: (row, column) in grid
actions:
  - name: rearrange
    description: Non-zero elements are reordered within the grid.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Elements have positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries.
  - type: input-output
    description: Elements in the input grid are mapped to different positions in the output grid based on an unknown rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify non-zero elements:** Find all the non-zero digits (elements) within the input grid.
2.  **Order non-zero elements**: reorder the non-zero elements by reading values top to bottom, left to right in the **output** grid.
3. **Read output locations**: read the locations, top to bottom, then left to right that would be occupied in the output grid if all the positions in the grid were filled sequentially.
4.  **Place elements:** Place the ordered non-zero elements from step 2, sequentially, into the identified locations determined in step 3, in the output grid, filling in zeros as necessary.

Essentially, the transformation reorders the non-zero elements of the input grid and places them in the order of reading cells top to bottom, left to right, into the output grid.
