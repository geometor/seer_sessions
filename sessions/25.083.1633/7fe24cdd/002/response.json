            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempts to embed a 3x3 input grid into a 6x6 output grid and then perform reflections. However, the reflection logic is incorrect, leading to mismatches in pixel positions and overall pattern. The strategy to fix this is to correctly implement the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections. It seems the diagonal reflection implemented via `reflect_corner` is incorrect. We need to transpose the input grid, in essence making rows into columns, and place the result in the bottom right 3x3 corner of the 6x6 output array. We should check our assumption regarding row and column reflection.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using manual inspection, and referencing the code and results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 6x6\n    *   Pixels Off: 20.  This means a substantial part of the reflection is incorrect.\n    *   The provided expected and actual outputs don't appear related.  This implies an error beyond simple mis-reflection.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 6x6\n    *   Pixels Off: 10. Still many errors, but fewer than the first.\n    *   Again, general observation suggests more than a diagonal reflection issue.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 6x6\n    *   Pixels Off: 8.  The fewest errors of all, yet incorrect.\n    *   The output suggests an issue in placement of the horizontal reflection.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
