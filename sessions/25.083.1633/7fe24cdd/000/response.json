The output grid is larger than the input grid (6x6 vs 3x3). The input grid seems to be \"embedded\" within the output, and the surrounding cells are filled based on a reflection/repetition pattern. It's not a straightforward horizontal or vertical flip; there's a diagonal element, and also repetition of values that are 'off axis'. The colors (represented by numbers) themselves are preserved, indicating that the transformation is purely structural/positional.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
