Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simple reflection concept (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). The results clearly show that this approach is not entirely correct for all examples. While the size of the output grid is consistently correct (6x6), and basic reflection is observable, there are significant discrepancies in the pixel values, indicating errors in the reflection logic. It is important to update the reflection process. Specifically, the combination of horizontal, vertical and diagonal reflections as previously implemented is not the accurate transformation, it seems that order or operations matters as well.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to identify the *precise* reflection/transformation rule. Pay close attention to the order and type of reflections.
2.  **Corrected Reflection Logic:** Based on the re-examination, formulate a revised understanding of how the reflections are combined (or if a different transformation is at play).
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Translate the corrected logic into a clear, step-by-step natural language program.
4. Consider that the provided code could be completely incorrect, and derive a plan from first-principles.

**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution where helpful):**

No need for code execution here. We are given metrics, the most important are:
- example 1: 20 Pixels off
- example 2: 10 Pixels off
- example 3: 8 Pixels off

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task: reflection_and_expansion
  - input_type: 3x3 grid
  - output_type: 6x6 grid
  - example_1:
      input: |
        3 8 2
        3 2 2
        8 5 2
      expected_output: |
        3 8 2 2 8 3
        3 2 2 2 2 3
        8 5 2 2 5 8
        2 2 2 2 5 8
        8 2 5 2 2 3
        3 3 8 2 8 3
      observations:
        - The output grid is a 6x6 expansion of the 3x3 input grid.
        - The top-left quadrant of the output is identical to the input.
        - output[0,:] is a horizontal reflection of input[:,:] except for the center, where instead of reflecting within the input row, picks up from the reflection in the second column.
        - The reflections do not operate independently.
  - example_2:
      input: |
        8 5 0
        8 5 3
        0 3 2
      expected_output: |
        8 5 0 0 5 8
        8 5 3 3 5 8
        0 3 2 2 3 0
        0 3 2 2 3 0
        5 5 3 3 5 8
        8 8 0 0 5 8
      observations:
        - Similar expansion and embedding as Example 1.
        - output[0,:] horizontal reflection looks correct
  - example_3:
      input: |
        0 3 0
        6 6 6
        0 3 0
      expected_output: |
        0 3 0 0 3 0
        6 6 6 6 6 6
        0 3 0 0 3 0
        0 3 0 0 3 0
        6 6 6 6 6 6
        0 3 0 0 3 0
      observations:
       - output[0,:] horizontal reflection looks correct
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Embed:** Place the 3x3 input grid into the top-left quadrant (cells \[0:3, 0:3]) of a 6x6 output grid.
2. **Horizontal Reflection into top right:** Reflect the input grid *horizontally* and place the reflected version into the top-right quadrant (cells \[0:3, 3:6]) of the output grid. The horizontal reflection takes output\[i,j] = input\[i, 3-1-j].
3. **Vertical Reflection into the bottom:** Reflect the *entire* top half of the *output grid* (which now contains both the original and the horizontally reflected input) *vertically* into the bottom half of the output grid.

This process will correctly combine horizontal reflection of input and vertical reflection of the partially completed output, creating a combined reflection.
