            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple reflection concept (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). The results clearly show that this approach is not entirely correct for all examples. While the size of the output grid is consistently correct (6x6), and basic reflection is observable, there are significant discrepancies in the pixel values, indicating errors in the reflection logic. It is important to update the reflection process. Specifically, the combination of horizontal, vertical and diagonal reflections as previously implemented is not the accurate transformation, it seems that order or operations matters as well.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to identify the *precise* reflection/transformation rule. Pay close attention to the order and type of reflections.\n2.  **Corrected Reflection Logic:** Based on the re-examination, formulate a revised understanding of how the reflections are combined (or if a different transformation is at play).\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Translate the corrected logic into a clear, step-by-step natural language program.\n4. Consider that the provided code could be completely incorrect, and derive a plan from first-principles.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution where helpful):**\n\nNo need for code execution here. We are given metrics, the most important are:\n- example 1: 20 Pixels off\n- example 2: 10 Pixels off\n- example 3: 8 Pixels off\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
