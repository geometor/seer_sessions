Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are 3x3 grids, and the outputs are 6x6 grids. This suggests a doubling in both dimensions.\n*   The input grids contain the value `5` (gray) and `0` (white).\n*   The output grids contain values `1` (blue), `2` (red), and `0` (white). This indicates a color mapping or substitution is occurring.\n*   The gray pixels (`5`) in the input seem to be replaced by alternating blue (`1`) and red (`2`) pixels in the output. The white (`0`) remains the same.\n*\tThere is an underlying checkerboard type of pattern that is being introduced into the output\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The output grid will be twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve Whites:** For every pixel in the input grid that is white (value `0`), maintain a white pixel (`0`) in the corresponding *block* within the expanded output grid. Because of the expansion, each input pixel now relates to a 2x2 block of 4 pixels.\n3. **Map and Alternate Gray:**\n    For every pixel in the input grid that is gray (value 5), replace that gray with a 2 x 2 checker board using color values 1 and 2 (blue and red), as follows:\n        - top left: 1\n        - top right: 2\n        - bottom left: 2\n        - bottom right: 1\n\nEssentially, each gray pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 blue/red checkerboard in the output, and white pixels get a 2x2 block of all white.\n"
