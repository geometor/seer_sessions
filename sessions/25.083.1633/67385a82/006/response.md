Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize improvements.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code was designed to find 2x2 green squares and replace them with azure. However, the test results reveal inconsistencies. It's clear the code is not *always* replacing *all* such squares, or it's failing to identify some 2x2 green squares, or the rule itself is wrong. The strategy is to:

1.  **Verify Square Detection:** Double-check the `find_2x2_green_squares` function's logic. Use tools to manually inspect its output for each example, comparing it with what *should* be detected.
2.  **Examine Transformation Logic:** Ensure the `transform` function correctly applies the azure color to the identified squares.
3.  **Revisit the Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, refine the natural language program to more accurately capture the transformation rule, paying close attention to edge cases and exceptions that might have been missed in the initial interpretation. The provided examples show cases where not all green squares are transformed.

**Gather Metrics and Investigate:**

Let's use `tool_code` to analyze the intermediate outputs of the `find_2x2_green_squares` for each example. This will help determine if the issue is in detection or transformation.


``` python
import numpy as np

def find_2x2_green_squares(grid):
    """Finds the top-left coordinates of all 2x2 green squares in the grid."""
    squares = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            if (grid[r, c] == 3 and
                grid[r, c + 1] == 3 and
                grid[r + 1, c] == 3 and
                grid[r + 1, c + 1] == 3):
                squares.append((r, c))
    return squares

# Example inputs (as numpy arrays)
example_inputs = [
    np.array([[3, 3, 0, 3],
              [3, 3, 0, 0],
              [3, 0, 0, 3],
              [0, 0, 3, 3]]),
    np.array([[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3],
              [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
              [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
    np.array([[3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0],
              [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3]]),
    np.array([[3, 3, 0],
              [0, 3, 0],
              [3, 0, 3]])
]

# Find and print the detected squares for each example
for i, input_grid in enumerate(example_inputs):
    squares = find_2x2_green_squares(input_grid)
    print(f"Example {i + 1} - Detected Squares: {squares}")


```
```
Example 1 - Detected Squares: [(0, 0)]
Example 2 - Detected Squares: []
Example 3 - Detected Squares: [(3, 1)]
Example 4 - Detected Squares: []

```
**Analysis of Detected Squares:**

*   **Example 1:** The code correctly detects the 2x2 green square at (0, 0). However, it misses a 2x2 square of green at the lower right corner.
*   **Example 2:** The code fails to detect the 2x2 green square at (1, 1).
*   **Example 3:** The code correctly detects the 2x2 green square at (3, 1).
*   **Example 4:** The code fails to detect the incomplete 2x2 green square at (0,0) because one element of the 2x2 square is not green.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task: replace_green_squares
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
  - name: square
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - cell_value: 3 (green)  # All cells within the square must be green
actions:
  - name: find_squares
    input: grid
    output: list of coordinates
    description: Locates all 2x2 squares composed entirely of green pixels.
  - name: replace_color
    input: grid, list of coordinates
    output: modified grid
    description: Changes the color of all pixels within identified squares to azure (8).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Green Squares:** Scan the input grid to find all 2x2 squares where *all four* pixels are green (value 3).
2.  **Record Top-Left Coordinates:**  For each identified 2x2 green square, store the (row, column) coordinates of its top-left pixel.
3.  **Transform to Azure:** Iterate through the list of recorded coordinates. For each coordinate:
    *   Change the color of the 2x2 square starting at that top left coordinate, setting each cell to azure (value 8).
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid. The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid, with identified 2x2 green squares replaced with azure, and all other pixels remaining the same as the input.
