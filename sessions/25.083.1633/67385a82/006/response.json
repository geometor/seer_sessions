However, the test results reveal inconsistencies. It's clear the code is not *always* replacing *all* such squares, or it's failing to identify some 2x2 green squares, or the rule itself is wrong. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Verify Square Detection:** Double-check the `find_2x2_green_squares` function's logic. Use tools to manually inspect its output for each example, comparing it with what *should* be detected.\n2.  **Examine Transformation Logic:** Ensure the `transform` function correctly applies the azure color to the identified squares.\n3.  **Revisit the Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, refine the natural language program to more accurately capture the transformation rule, paying close attention to edge cases and exceptions that might have been missed in the initial interpretation. The provided examples show cases where not all green squares are transformed.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Investigate:**\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to analyze the intermediate outputs of the `find_2x2_green_squares` for each example. This will help determine if the issue is in detection or transformation.\n\n"
