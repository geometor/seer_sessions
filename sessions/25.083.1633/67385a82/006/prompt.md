```python
"""
1.  **Scan the Input Grid:** Examine the entire input grid to identify *all* occurrences of 2x2 squares composed *entirely* of green (3) pixels.
2.  **Record Square Locations:** Store the top-left coordinates (row, column) of each identified 2x2 green square in a list.
3.  **Transform Squares:** Iterate through the list of recorded square locations. For *each* location:
    *   Change the color of the pixel at the top-left coordinate to azure (8).
    *   Change the color of the pixel to the right of the top-left coordinate to azure (8).
    *   Change the color of the pixel below the top-left coordinate to azure (8).
    *   Change the color of the pixel diagonally down and to the right of the top-left coordinate to azure (8).
4. **Output:** Return the modified grid where identified 2x2 green squares have been changed to azure, and all other pixels remain unchanged.
