The decision of *which* '3's to replace appears to be based on their position relative to other '3's. Specifically, it looks like '3's that form the top-left part of a 2x2 green square are changed to '8'.  Isolated '3' pixels, and those only adjacent on a single side to another '3', are left alone.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
