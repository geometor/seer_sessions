The presence of yellow and green in the input seems to trigger the appearance of magenta in the output.\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The relative positions of the colors seem crucial. There isn't an obvious overall grid transformation (like rotation or mirroring). It feels more like local interactions.\n*   **Object Interactions:** the transformation doesn't seem to follow the boundaries of objects. For example, in train\\_4 there is a 3x3 block of changes.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The spatial layout is preserved; only specific colors are altered.\n"
