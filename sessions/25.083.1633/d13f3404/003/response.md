1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Output:** A 6x6 grid of colored pixels.
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   The output grid's dimensions are twice the input grid's dimensions (rows and cols).
    *   Each element (pixel) from the input grid is replicated in the output grid, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) and going down and to the right diagonally.
    * Each row of the input grid seeds a diagonal replication of it's elements, starting at the element's own position in the output grid. The copy process is shifted of one position to the right at each input row.
    *   Any cells in the output grid not filled by this diagonal replication process are set to black (0).
