--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I'm ready to analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. Here's my step-by-step description of the transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The primary objects in the grid are contiguous sequences of the same non-zero color. These can appear either horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Predicate Identification**: We need to determine a single property of certain objects - whether or not the object is at an "end". More specifically is one end is "open", touching the border of the input/output.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Locate the non zero pixels at the border of the grid.
    *   Change the color of the object to 1 if the selected border pixel is from a vertical sequence.

**In simpler terms:**

The transformation identifies vertical sequences of color '8' that touch the edge of the grid. The top-most '8' of such sequences, is changed to '1'.

I believe this description fully encompasses the observed transformation rule. I have tried to be very specific in the vocabulary of ARC to describe objects, predicates, and the actions that combine to create a transformation rule.


```
example_1_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

example_1_output = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]
```
**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ allowed imports that support the transform }}

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [
        {{ Input grid rows }}
    ]

    expected_output = [
        {{ expected output grid rows }}
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("[bold green]SUCCESS![/]")
    else:
        print("[bold red]FAILED![/]")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
