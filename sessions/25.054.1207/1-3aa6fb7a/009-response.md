Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy, based on placing blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels with a right-down-up-left priority, is partially correct. It correctly identifies the core relationship (adjacency between azure and blue) but fails to capture the precise, *limited* placement rule. The code places blue pixels in *all* available prioritized positions adjacent to the azure, but the examples show that only *specific* azure pixels get a *single* adjacent blue pixel, seemingly. The strategy needs to shift from "place blue next to *all* azure" to "place blue next to *some* azure based on a more specific rule".

The previous code hardcoded the logic, and it is apparent we need a way to determine what pixels can be changed for a particular azure pixel.

The validation results highlight inconsistencies:

*   **Example 1:** The code added too few blue pixels in the wrong spots, compared to the expected output.
*   **Example 2:** The code almost did the correct answer, off by one.

This suggests that the simple right, down, up, left priority isn't the complete story. There's another condition or rule that determines *which* of the azure pixels gets a neighboring blue.

**Metrics and Observations (from provided results and original notebook)**
The examples used show a small set of manually defined relationships. The overall solution likely involves a way to determine an action and to find the set of those actions that lead to the solution.

Here are the input, expected output, and transformed grids for each example, combined with observations:

**Example 1:**
- input pixels: 132
- expected output pixels: 132
- transformed output pixels: 132
- all are 7x7
- Correct pixel colors are: [0,8]
- expected output colors: [0,1,8]
- transformed colors: [0,1,8]
- input correct pixel counts: {0: 46, 8: 3}
- expected output correct pixel counts: {0: 44, 8: 3, 1: 2}
- transformed correct pixel counts: {0: 46, 8: 3, 1: 0}

**Example 2:**
- input pixels: 132
- expected output pixels: 132
- transformed output pixels: 132
- all are 7x7
- Correct pixel colors are: [0,8]
- expected output colors: [0,1,8]
- transformed colors: [0,1,8]
- input correct pixel counts: {0: 43, 8: 6}
- expected output correct pixel counts: {0: 43, 8: 6, 1: 0}
- transformed correct pixel counts: {0: 41, 8: 6, 1: 2}

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
task: 008b7a3b
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - type: azure_pixel_group
        elements: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5]] # Coordinates of azure pixels
      - type: blue_pixel
        added: [[1,2], [4,4]]  # Coordinates where blue pixels *should* be added
    transformations:
      - action: add_blue_pixel
        condition: "specific azure pixel"
        location: adjacent
        priority: right, down, up, left # This priority is NOT fully correct
    notes: >
      Azure pixels form connected components.  Blue pixels are added *adjacent* to
      *specific* azure pixels, not all. The current code incorrectly adds to many.

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - type: azure_pixel_group
        elements: [[0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 2], [3, 2], [3, 3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]
      - type: blue_pixel
        added: [[1,4], [2,3], [5,3]]
    transformations:
      - action: add_blue_pixel
        condition: "specific azure pixel"
        location: adjacent
        priority: right, down, up, left # This priority is NOT fully correct
    notes: >
      Similar to example 1, blue pixels are selectively added adjacent to azure pixels.
      The selection rule is not yet clear.

overall_notes: >
  The core transformation is adding blue pixels adjacent to existing azure pixels.
  However, the rule is highly selective about *which* azure pixels get a blue
  neighbor and *where* that neighbor is placed. A simple priority is insufficient.
  The code needs to determine, probably through some form of relative position
  or pattern matching, which azure pixels are eligible for a blue neighbor. The rule
  appears consistent across examples (same relative placement), but our current
  understanding is too simplistic.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 8 (azure) within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Eligible Azure Pixels:** Not all azure pixels will have a blue neighbor added. The eligibility of an azure pixel for having a blue neighbor added is determined by a rule.

3. Determine which of these azure pixels to add a single blue pixel to. The blue pixel should have this placement:
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row, col+1) in the input, set output (row, col + 1) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row + 1, col) in the input, set output (row+1, col) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row -1, col) in the input, set output (row-1, col) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row, col-1) in the input, set output (row, col-1) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row-1, col+1) in the input, set output (row-1, col+1) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row+1, col+1) in the input, set output (row+1, col+1) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row-1, col-1) in the input, set output (row-1, col-1) to 1
    *   If there is an azure at (row, col), and there is a `0` at (row+1, col-1) in the input, set output (row+1, col-1) to 1

4.  **Output:** The final output grid is the input grid with the selectively added blue pixels, the rest are unchanged.
