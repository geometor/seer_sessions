            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which it handles mostly correctly (except for placing one additional blue pixel). The code correctly handles the second example. The core issue is that the placement logic in the existing code, although prioritizing right, down, up, and left, doesn't fully capture the underlying rule, as evidenced by the extra blue pixel in example 1. The conditional statements for placement are too specific to row and column and need to be more generalized and be based on the object not just the pixel.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define \"azure objects\" as connected components of azure pixels.\n2.  **Generalize Placement Logic:** Instead of hardcoded row/col conditions, determine blue pixel placement based on the relative position *within* each azure object, specifically for placing the blue pixel adjacent to the \"right-most\" azure pixel.\n3. **Improve neighbor selection**: ensure that only white pixels receive a blue neighbor.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations about object properties and actions:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input Objects:** Two azure objects. One is a 2x1 vertical object (left side), and the other is a 2x2 object.\n    *   **Expected Transformation:** A blue pixel is placed to the right of the top-rightmost azure pixel of the first azure object and to the left of the bottom left-most azure pixel of the second object.\n    *   **Code Result:** One extra blue pixel to the right of object 2.\n    *   **Observation/Facts:** The initial logic doesn't properly limit adding only *one* blue pixel adjacent to an object (it adds 2 because of prioritizing 'right' first).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input Objects:** Three azure objects. One 2x1, on the left; two 2x1 on the right top and bottom.\n    *   **Expected Transformation**: Adds a single adjacent blue to each object.\n    *   **Code Result:** Correct\n    *   **Observation/Facts:** Logic to add blue pixel relative to object works.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - id: 1\n        color: azure\n        shape: vertical_rectangle\n        dimensions: 2x1\n        top_left_corner: [1,1]\n        action: add_blue_neighbor\n        neighbor_position: right\n      - id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        dimensions: 2x2\n        top_left_corner: [3,4]\n        action: add_blue_neighbor\n        neighbor_position: left\n    outcome: partially_correct\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - id: 1\n        color: azure\n        shape: vertical_rectangle\n        dimensions: 2x1\n        top_left_corner: [2,2]\n        action: add_blue_neighbor\n        neighbor_position: right\n      - id: 2\n          color: azure\n          shape: vertical_rectangle\n          dimensions: 2x1\n          top_left_corner: [0,4]\n          action: add_blue_neighbor\n          neighbor_position: left\n      - id: 3\n          color: azure\n          shape: vertical_rectangle\n          dimensions: 2x1\n          top_left_corner: [5,3]\n          action: add_blue_neighbor\n          neighbor_position: left\n    outcome: correct\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous groups (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Process Each Object:** For each identified azure object:\n    *   Find the white (0) neighbor pixels.\n    *   Iterate over the azure pixels, start with the right-most azure pixel, then the bottom-most, then up-most, then left-most.\n    *   Add a blue (1) pixel to the first available neighbor, starting with neighbors to the right, then down, then up, then left.\n    *   Stop processing the current object when a single blue pixel has been placed.\n\nThis revised program focuses on processing each *object* rather than individual azure pixels, which better reflects the transformation rule's intent. The prioritization of placement is now relative to the object's boundaries, which is crucial for generalization.\n"
