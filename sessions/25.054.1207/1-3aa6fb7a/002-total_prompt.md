## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7FB7F2A16050>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7FB7F2A37970>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves two 7x7 grids. The input grid contains azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that some of the azure pixels are replaced by blue (1) pixels. The blue pixels appear to be replacing azure pixels that are at the "top" of azure regions that extend down and possibly right.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: pixels
      background_color: white (0)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      possible_values: [0, 1, 8]
      color_mapping:
        0: white
        1: blue
        8: azure
  - transformation: color_change
    input_color: azure (8)
    output_color: blue (1)
    condition: "topmost azure pixel in a contiguous azure region"
  - observation: "contiguous azure regions are vertical or L-shaped"

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is defined as a group of azure pixels connected vertically and/or horizontally, and possibly diagonally.

2.  **Identify Topmost Pixels:** Within each identified azure region, find the azure pixel that is furthest towards the top (minimum row index). It is the topmost pixel within that contiguous block

3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the identified topmost azure pixel to blue (1).

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
