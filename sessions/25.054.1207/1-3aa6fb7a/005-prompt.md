Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Azure Regions: Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2. Iterate Through Regions: For each identified azure region:
    a. Find Occupied Columns: Determine the set of columns that contain at least one pixel from the current region.
    b. Iterate Through Columns: For each column identified in step 2a:
        i. Find Topmost Azure Pixel: Within the current column and current region, find the azure pixel with the smallest row index (the topmost one in that column).
        ii. Change Color: Change the color of this topmost azure pixel to blue (1).
3. Preserve Other Pixels: Ensure all pixels that were not identified as the topmost azure pixel in a column of an azure region retain their original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
