Two pixels are considered part of the same region if they are adjacent (up, down, left, or right) and have the same color.\n\n2. Process Each Region Independently: For *each* identified azure region:\n\n    a. Determine Occupied Columns: Find the set of columns that contain at least one pixel from *this specific* region.\n\n    b. Find Topmost Azure Pixel *within the region and column*:** For each column identified in step 2a, find the azure pixel within *this specific region* that has the smallest row index (the topmost one).\n\n    c. Change Color: Change the color of this topmost azure pixel (identified in 2b) to blue (1).\n\n3. Preserve Other Pixels: All pixels that were not identified as the topmost azure pixel within a specific region and its occupied column retain their original color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous regions of a specific color in a grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    regions = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_region):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to explore contiguous regions.\"\"\"\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= col < grid.shape[1]) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_region.append((row, col))\n        # Check adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_region)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_region)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_region)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_region)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and (row, col) not in visited:\n                current_region = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_region)\n                regions.append(current_region)\n    return regions\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    # Find all contiguous regions of azure color\n    azure_regions = find_contiguous_regions(output_grid, 8)\n\n    # Process each region independently\n    for region in azure_regions:\n        # Determine occupied columns for the current region\n        columns = set(pixel[1] for pixel in region)\n\n        # Iterate through each column occupied by the current region\n        for col in columns:\n            # Find the topmost azure pixel within the current region and column\n            topmost_pixel = None\n            min_row = float('inf')\n            for row, c in region:\n                if c == col and row < min_row:\n                    min_row = row\n                    topmost_pixel = (row, col)\n\n            # Change the color of the topmost pixel to blue\n            if topmost_pixel:\n                output_grid[topmost_pixel[0], topmost_pixel[1]] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
