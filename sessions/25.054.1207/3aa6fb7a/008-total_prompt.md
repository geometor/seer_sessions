## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7FB7F2A37CD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially with values of 0 (white) and 8 (azure). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of the value 1 (blue) in specific locations relative to the existing 8 (azure) pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. It appears the azure colored pixels may be acting as seeds, from which the new blue colored pixels emerge.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - blue (1)
      position: [row, column]
    relationships:
      - adjacency:  Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

actions:
  - type: introduce
    description: A new pixel of color 'blue' (1) is introduced.
    parameters:
      location: Determined relative to existing 'azure' (8) pixels.

transformation:
  input: Grid with white and azure pixels.
  output: Grid with white, azure, and blue pixels.
  rule: "Blue pixels appear adjacent to existing azure pixels."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Iterate:** For each azure pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent).
3.  **Check:** For each neighboring empty/background position, check the output to see if a blue pixel is in this neighbor position.
4. **Fill based on a rule**: If, in the output a neighboring position is not another color, place a blue (1) pixel into the neighbor position where one appears in the output grid, prioritizing positions that are immediately to the right or immediately below the 8 pixel, and then those that are above or left.

In summary, the transformation involves selectively placing blue (1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (8) pixels based on the positions of the blue pixels seen in the provided output. The rule prioritizes right and down, then up and left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
