            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, focusing on azure (8) pixels and their positions. However, the logic incorrectly assumed that *every* row containing an azure pixel would have a pixel changed to blue. The second example demonstrates that this is not always the case, and requires modification. The key error lies in unconditionally changing an azure pixel in *every* row that *contains* azure. The examples show it is not the *first* azure in a row, but rather, an azure that borders a region of different color or the boarder of the grid. It seems that the \"right-most\" azure that is adjacent to a non-azure pixel (or grid edge) to its right, within a contiguous horizontal line of azure pixels, is the one to be turned blue.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define \"contiguous horizontal azure regions\" as the core objects.\n2.  **Precise Action Condition:** Instead of focusing on the \"minimum column,\" the rule should focus on azure pixels at the \"end\" (right-hand side) of the contiguous horizontal regions. Specifically an azure pixel adjacent to a non-azure pixel or the end of the row.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code based on these more precise observations.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nTo confirm our understanding, we perform more detailed calculations, and report on several metrics.\n\n**Example 1 Metrics Report:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef calculate_metrics(input_str, expected_str, transformed_str):\n    input_grid = np.loadtxt(StringIO(input_str), dtype=int)\n    expected_grid = np.loadtxt(StringIO(expected_str), dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = np.loadtxt(StringIO(transformed_str), dtype=int)\n\n    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_grid != transformed_grid)\n    size_correct = input_grid.shape == expected_grid.shape == transformed_grid.shape\n    \n    unique_expected, counts_expected = np.unique(expected_grid, return_counts=True)\n    unique_transformed, counts_transformed = np.unique(transformed_grid, return_counts=True)\n\n    color_palette_correct = np.array_equal(np.sort(unique_expected), np.sort(unique_transformed))\n    correct_pixel_counts = np.array_equal(counts_expected, counts_transformed)\n\n    report = {\n        'pixels_off': int(pixels_off),\n        'size_correct': bool(size_correct),\n        'color_palette_correct': bool(color_palette_correct),\n        'correct_pixel_counts':  bool(correct_pixel_counts)\n    }\n    return report\n\ninput_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\"\"\"\nexpected_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 1 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\"\"\"\ntransformed_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\"\"\"\n\nreport = calculate_metrics(input_str, expected_str, transformed_str)\nprint(report)\n\n```\n\n```\n{'pixels_off': 6, 'size_correct': True, 'color_palette_correct': True, 'correct_pixel_counts': False}\n```\n\n**Example 2 Metrics Report:**\n\n```python\ninput_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n\"\"\"\nexpected_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 8 1 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 8 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n\"\"\"\ntransformed_str = \"\"\"\n0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 8 0 0\n\"\"\"\n\nreport = calculate_metrics(input_str, expected_str, transformed_str)\nprint(report)\n```\n\n```\n{'pixels_off': 9, 'size_correct': True, 'color_palette_correct': True, 'correct_pixel_counts': False}\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: contiguous_horizontal_azure_regions\n    description: Horizontal sequences of adjacent azure (8) pixels.\n    properties:\n      - length: Number of azure pixels in the sequence.\n      - end_position: Column index of the right-most azure pixel.\n      - row: Row index of the sequence.\n\nactions:\n  - name: change_color\n    description: Change the color of a single azure pixel to blue.\n    preconditions:\n      - The azure pixel must be at the end_position of a contiguous_horizontal_azure_region.\n      - The pixel to the right of the azure pixel must be a different color or be outside the grid boundary.\n    postconditions:\n      - The selected azure pixel's color is changed to blue (1).\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Contiguous Horizontal Azure Regions:** Find all horizontal sequences of adjacent azure (8) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Locate End Pixel:** For each identified region, determine the right-most azure pixel (the pixel with the largest column index within that horizontal sequence).\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:** If the pixel to the immediate right of the identified \"end pixel\" is *not* azure (8), or if the end pixel is at the right edge of the grid, change the \"end pixel's\" color to blue (1).\n4. **All Else:** Keep all other pixels the same as the input.\n"
