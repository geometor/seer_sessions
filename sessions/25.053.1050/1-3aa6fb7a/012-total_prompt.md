Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Identify:** Identify the positions of all azure colored pixels.
3.  **Locate:** Locate all white colored pixels adjacent to the azure ones
4.  **Check:** Working from upper left and lower right, determine if a white pixel that is adjecent to an azure pixel, has an azure neighbor to the left and or the right.
5.  **Transformation:** If the condition in step 4 is met for a white pixel, change the value/color to blue (1). If multiple white pixels next to azure qualify, transform one at a time, working in from the upper left and lower right.
6.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting Python code focused on identifying azure pixels and then transforming adjacent white pixels to blue based on the presence of horizontal azure neighbors. This strategy is partially correct but incomplete. It fails to capture the specific spatial relationship or "containment" aspect where the white pixel must be *between* two azure pixels on the *same row*. The "working from upper left and lower right" concept is unnecessary and overly complicated.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Simplify the Logic:** Eliminate the "working from upper left and lower right" concept. The transformation should happen in a single pass.
2.  **Refine the Condition:** The core issue is the condition for changing a white pixel to blue. It should only occur if a white pixel has azure pixels *both to its left and right on the same row*.
3. **Remove iteration dependency:** The current rule makes white-to-blue only dependent on two azure pixels existing on the same row, not on the iterative fill direction.

**Example Metrics and Analysis (Code Execution):**

We can manually inspect each of the examples since we have them here.  The python code isn't necessary.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid. Azure pixels at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).
*   **Expected Output:** White pixel at (1,2) and (4,4) should change to blue.
*   **Transformed Output:** No change
*   **Analysis:** The code doesn't change these pixels because the conditions are not met based on the current rule. The key insight: the white pixels that turn blue are *between* two azure pixels *horizontally*.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 7x7 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** White pixels at (1,4), (2,3), and (5,3) are changed to blue.
*    **Transformed Output:** No change
*   **Analysis:** Again, the condition for transformation is not met, demonstrating that simple adjacency isn't enough; it's *horizontal enclosure* that matters.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all azure (8) and white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate:** For each white pixel, check its row.
3.  **Condition:** A white pixel changes to blue (1) *if and only if* there are azure pixels both to its immediate left and right on the *same* row.
4.  **Output:** The modified grid, with the appropriate white pixels changed to blue, is the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
