The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If multiple white pixels next to azure qualify, transform one at a time, working in from the upper left and lower right.\n6.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.\n\nEssentially the rule appears to fill inwards, converting white to blue, in a zig-zag manner, working inwards from two corners.\n"
