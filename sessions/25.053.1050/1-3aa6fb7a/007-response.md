Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code were based on the first training example, aiming to find the centroid of azure pixels and change the color of the nearest azure pixel(s) to blue. However, the results on the second example show that this approach is not entirely correct. The code sometimes changes only *one* of the central pixels when it needs to change *multiple* pixels. It seems that there can be two "centers" one on either side of the middle.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the Discrepancies:** Carefully examine why the code fails on the second example. The problem is in finding *all* central pixels. I need to be sure that the `find_nearest_azure_pixels` is finding all that should be selected, and update my understanding of "central".
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description of the transformation to reflect that several, equidistant, center pixels may exist and need to be changed.
3.  **Metrics and Reports:**

    *   **Example 1:**
        *   Pixels Off: 4
        *   Initially, two azure pixels (1,1) and (2,2) are closest to the centroid. The function changes (2,2). Should be both.
        *   Two other azure pixels are closest (3,4), (4,5). Changed (3,4). Should be both.
    *   **Example 2:**
        *   Pixels Off: 4
        *   Two azure pixels in different locations that are closest, only one changes.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: 006-py_03
observations:
  - object: azure_pixels
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: varies
      description: Contiguous or non-contiguous blocks of azure pixels.
  - object: central_pixels
    properties:
      color: initially azure (8), becomes blue (1)
      description: The azure pixel(s) closest to the centroid of all azure pixels. There can be more than one pixel with this minimum distance. All pixels with minimal distance to centroid.
  - action: color_change
    description: Change the color of all the central_pixels from azure to blue.
    trigger: The central_pixels are identified.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color azure (8) within the input grid.
2.  **Calculate Centroid:** If there are azure pixels, compute the centroid (average row and column index) of these pixels.
3.  **Find Nearest Azure Pixel:** Determine the azure pixels that are closest to the calculated centroid. Use Euclidean distance to measure closeness.
4. **Change all "central" pixels:** For *all* pixels closest to the average row/column, change the pixel color from azure (8) to blue (1).
