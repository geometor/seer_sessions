facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - cell_values: [0-9] representing colors
  - object: azure_pixels
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: dispersed, potentially forming multiple sub-objects
    actions:
      - None:  # Azure pixels themselves don't seem to be modified
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: appears as single pixels
    actions:
       - introduced:  # Blue pixels are added; they do not exist in the initial state
    relationships:
      - adjacency: blue pixels are placed adjacent to azure pixels.
      - location: It appears blue pixels replace white pixels where the white pixels are adjacent to an azure pixel, and it appears the transformation works inward from the upper left and the lower right.
