The colors are represented by integers. There are a few distinct colors present other than the background white (0).  The transformation appears to involve some kind of movement or combination of colored pixels. Specifically, it looks like the maroon (9) pixel in the top right is being moved down. The azure (8) pixel in the second row appears to be combined with the one below.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
