# Example

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7745EA788670>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7745EA789360>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color. The output grid maintains the same dimensions (3x3) and contains single-digit integers, also corresponding to colors. The transformation seems to involve a consistent mapping of input values to output values, where the spatial position is not changing.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: determined by integer value based on a predefined color map

actions:
  - type: value_mapping
    description: Each integer in the input is replaced by a corresponding integer in the output.
    details: >
        The mapping is consistent across all cells in the grid, but is not identity (i.e, the numbers change)

relationships:
  - type: spatial_invariance
    description: The position of each element remains constant during the transformation.
  - type: one-to-one_mapping
    description: there appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between input numbers and output numbers
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, where each integer corresponds to a color.
2.  **Transformation:** Replace each integer in the input grid with a new integer according to the following rule:
    *   2 becomes 6
    *   3 becomes 4
    *   8 becomes 9
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the same dimensions as the input, where each cell contains the transformed integer value, maintaining its original position. The output integers will have colors associated via the same scheme as in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
