Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color. The output grid maintains the same dimensions (3x3) and contains single-digit integers, also corresponding to colors. The transformation seems to involve a consistent mapping of input values to output values, where the spatial position is not changing.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
