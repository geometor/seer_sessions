Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were too simplistic. The code assumed a direct, fixed substitution (1->4, 2->5, 3->6) that only worked for some values and only on the first training example. The subsequent test results reveal that this assumption is incorrect, as the substitution pattern is more complex and depends on the all example values, not just 1, 2, and 3. It also changes between the examples, and we can see a transposition of input values to output values across all of the examples provided.

The strategy for resolving errors will involve:

1.  **Identifying the *actual* substitution rule:** We need to analyze all input/output pairs to determine the correct mapping of input values to output values. This is most likely a one-to-one mapping (bijection), as each value is replaced by a new value.
2.  **Updating the natural language program**: Once the correct substitution rule is found, the natural language program must be updated to reflect this more general transformation.
3.  **Modifying the code:** The Python code will need to be updated to use this new substitution rule.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To help understand the substitution, here's a more precise look at each example, focusing on the *before/after* values and making sure colors are correct:

```
Example 1:
Input:  [[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]
Output: [[6, 4, 5], [6, 4, 5], [6, 4, 5]]
Substitutions: 3->6, 1->4, 2->5

Example 2:
Input:  [[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]
Output: [[5, 6, 9], [5, 6, 9], [5, 6, 9]]
Substitutions: 2->5, 3->6, 8->9

Example 3:
Input:  [[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]
Output: [[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]
Substitutions: 5->1, 8->9, 6->2

Example 4:
Input:  [[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]
Output: [[8, 3, 5], [8, 3, 5], [8, 3, 5]]
Substitutions: 9->8, 4->3, 2->5
```

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 002
    type: substitution
    examples:
      - example_id: 1
        input_values: [3, 1, 2]
        output_values: [6, 4, 5]
        substitutions: {3: 6, 1: 4, 2: 5}
      - example_id: 2
        input_values: [2, 3, 8]
        output_values: [5, 6, 9]
        substitutions: {2: 5, 3: 6, 8: 9}
      - example_id: 3
        input_values: [5, 8, 6]
        output_values: [1, 9, 2]
        substitutions: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}
      - example_id: 4
        input_values: [9, 4, 2]
        output_values: [8, 3, 5]
        substitutions: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 5}
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The program performs a direct substitution of each pixel's value based on a mapping specific to each example. The mapping isn't consistent across all examples; it must be determined separately for each input/output pair.

1.  **Determine the Example-Specific Mapping:** For each example, create a mapping by comparing corresponding pixel values in the input and output grids.
2.  **Apply the Mapping:** For every pixel in the input grid, find its corresponding replacement value in the example-specific mapping and replace it in the output grid.
3.  Output is the resulting grid.
