# Example

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7745ED0D2350>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7745EA788670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, corresponding to blue, red, and green colors, respectively. The output grid contains the numbers 4, 5, and 6, which represent yellow, gray, and magenta. The spatial arrangement of the numbers/colors remains identical; only the values themselves are changed. The transformation appears to be a simple mapping or substitution of each number with a new number.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [1, 2, 3]
    output_values: [4, 5, 6]
    transformation_type: substitution
    mapping:
      1: 4
      2: 5
      3: 6
    spatial_properties: invariant
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program performs a direct substitution of each value.
1.  For every pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's value is 1, replace it with 4.
    *   If the pixel's value is 2, replace it with 5.
    *   If the pixel's value is 3, replace it with 6.
    *   Otherwise, keep the pixel's value.
2.  Output is the resulting grid

The core concept is a one-to-one mapping: 1 becomes 4, 2 becomes 5, and 3 becomes 6. The position of elements is constant, the color of each changes by the transformation of it's value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
