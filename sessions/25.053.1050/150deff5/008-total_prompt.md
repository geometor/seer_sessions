1.  **Identify Shapes:** Find all distinct, contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.  Each of these regions is considered a separate "shape."
2.  **Outline Each Shape:** For each identified shape:
    *   Iterate through all pixels within the shape.
    *   A gray pixel is part of the *outline* if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is *not* part of the *same* gray shape (either a different color or out of bounds).
    *   Replace all outline pixels of the shape with azure (8).
3.  **Fill Each Shape:** For each outlined shape:
    * fill the interior by flood filling from the edges inward, changing all gray pixels to red (2) until the azure outline is met.
4.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concepts of outlining and filling gray shapes. However, the execution reveals a flaw in the flood fill implementation. It appears the flood fill is "leaking" and not correctly respecting the boundaries established by the outlined pixels.  The strategy to resolve this will be to focus on refining the `flood_fill` function to properly contain the fill operation within the outlined regions.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze `flood_fill`:** The primary issue is with how `flood_fill` propagates. It seems to be based on a simple breadth-first search, but this approach doesn't account for the newly created azure outline *as a hard boundary*. It treats the outline as just another color to potentially overwrite.
2.  **Prioritize Outline as Boundary:** The `flood_fill` logic needs to be modified so that azure pixels are treated as *impassable barriers*, similar to how out-of-bounds cells are handled.
3. **Fix seeding of flood_fill** - ensure that the flood_fill operation starts inside the shapes.

**Metrics and Observations (using conceptual analysis, code execution would happen externally):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A few irregular gray shapes on a white background.
    *   Expected Output: Shapes outlined in azure, inner gray areas filled with red.
    *   Actual Output:  Incorrect fill - several red pixels are miscolored.
    *   Analysis: Flood fill not contained by the outline.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input:  More gray shapes.
    *   Expected Output:  Shapes outlined in azure, filled with red.
    *   Actual Output:  Incorrect fill.
    *   Analysis: Same as Example 1.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input:  Different gray shape arrangement.
    *   Expected Output: Shapes outlined in azure, filled with red.
    *   Actual Output: Incorrect fill.
    *   Analysis: Same as Example 1 and 2.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: shape
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - contiguous: true
      - outlineable: true
      - fillable: true
  - name: outline
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - boundary: true
      - generated: true # Derived, not present in original input
  - name: fill
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - interior: true
      - generated: true  # Derived

actions:
  - name: identify_shapes
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_shapes
    description: Find all contiguous gray regions.
  - name: outline
    input: shape, input_grid
    output: outlined_grid
    description: Replace boundary gray pixels with azure.
  - name: fill
    input: outlined_grid, shape
    output: filled_grid
    description: Replace interior gray pixels with red, bounded by azure.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Shapes:** Identify all distinct, contiguous regions (shapes) of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Outline Shapes:** For each identified gray shape:
    *   Iterate through all pixels of the shape.
    *   If a gray pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is *not* part of the *same* shape (either a different color or out of bounds), replace it with azure (8). This creates an outline around each shape.

3.  **Fill Shapes:** For each outlined shape:
    * find seed points, defined as gray points that are adjacent to the boundary.
    *   Use a flood-fill algorithm, starting from any internal points, to replace all interior, connected, gray (5) pixels with red (2).
    *   *Crucially*, the flood fill must *stop* when it encounters an azure (8) pixel (the outline) or the boundary of the grid. The outline acts as a strict boundary for the fill operation.

4.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged throughout the entire process.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
