      For each gray shape, replace the outermost gray
      pixels with azure (8).  A gray pixel is "outermost" if it
      is part of the shape and is adjacent (up, down, left, right)
      to a pixel that is not part of that shape.

    description: >
      For each outlined shape, replace the remaining interior
      gray (5) pixels with red (2). An interior pixel is any gray pixel
      that's not part of the outline and which is enclosed by the outline.
