The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify contiguous shapes of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2. Outline the outermost layer of the shape:
   - A gray pixel is considered part of the outline if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is *not* gray (including out-of-bounds).
   - Replace these outline pixels with azure (8).
3. Fill the interior of the outlined shape:
   - Any gray pixel that is *not* part of the outline is considered interior.
   - Replace these interior pixels with red (2).
4. Preserve the white (0) background.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with an updated natural language program and YAML facts:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the need to outline and fill a gray shape. However, the `is_outermost` function and the filling logic have flaws. The primary issue is that the outlining logic is too broad; It outlines *any* gray pixel adjacent to a non-gray pixel. The filling logic simply fills all other gray pixels which does not correctly handle multiple separated gray objects or concavities in the shape.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Refine Outlining:** Instead of checking for *any* non-gray neighbor, we should consider connectivity *within* the gray shape.  An outline pixel should be part of the contiguous gray shape, but have a non-gray neighbor. This requires a more robust definition of being "part of the shape."
2.  **Improve Filling:** After outlining, the filling should be performed more carefully.  It can't simply fill all remaining gray pixels. Instead, a flood-fill or similar algorithm is needed to fill only the regions enclosed by the outline.
3.  **Consider disconnected regions:** consider each connected region of gray separately

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using provided results)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `match`: False
    *   `pixels_off`: 11
    *   `size_correct`: True
    *   `color_palette_correct`: True
    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False
    *   **Analysis:** The outline is mostly correct, but some interior pixels are incorrectly identified as outline (azure). The fill is not completely accurate, showing some gaps and incorrect coloring.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   `match`: False
    *   `pixels_off`: 8
    *   `size_correct`: True
    *   `color_palette_correct`: True
    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False
    *   **Analysis:** Similar to Example 1, the outline is too inclusive. Some of the pixels that should be red are marked as outline (azure).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   `match`: False
    *   `pixels_off`: 6
    *   `size_correct`: True
    *   `color_palette_correct`: True
    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False
    *   **Analysis:** Again, the issue is with the outline being too broad. The entire shape gets outlined, and no red fill is applied because all gray pixels are categorized as being on the perimeter.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The background of the grid.
  - id: shape
    color: gray (5)
    description: >
      One or more contiguous regions of gray pixels.
      These regions are the targets for transformation.
  - id: outline
    color: azure (8)
    description: >
      The outline of the gray shape, formed by replacing
      the outermost layer of gray pixels with azure.
  - id: interior
    color: red (2)
    description: >
      The filled interior of the outlined gray shape,
      formed by replacing the inner gray pixels with red.

actions:
  - name: identify_shapes
    description: >
      Locate all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels.
  - name: outline_shape
    description: >
      For each gray shape, replace the outermost gray
      pixels with azure (8).  A gray pixel is "outermost" if it
      is part of the shape and is adjacent (up, down, left, right)
      to a pixel that is not part of that shape.
  - name: fill_shape
    description: >
      For each outlined shape, replace the remaining interior
      gray (5) pixels with red (2). An interior pixel is any gray pixel
      that's not part of the outline and which is enclosed by the outline.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Find all distinct, contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.  Each of these regions is considered a separate "shape."
2.  **Outline Each Shape:** For each identified shape:
    *   Iterate through all pixels within the shape.
    *   A gray pixel is part of the *outline* if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is *not* part of the *same* gray shape (either a different color or out of bounds).
    *   Replace all outline pixels of the shape with azure (8).
3.  **Fill Each Shape:** For each outlined shape:
    * fill the interior by flood filling from the edges inward, changing all gray pixels to red (2) until the azure outline is met.
4.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

The most significant updates here are the explicit mention of "distinct, contiguous regions" and the more precise definition of an outline pixel, emphasizing adjacency to a pixel *not* part of the *same* shape.  Also added is the concept of flood filling the interior, rather than simple replacement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
