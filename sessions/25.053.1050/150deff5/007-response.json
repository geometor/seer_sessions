            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concepts of outlining and filling gray shapes. However, the execution reveals a flaw in the flood fill implementation. It appears the flood fill is \"leaking\" and not correctly respecting the boundaries established by the outlined pixels.  The strategy to resolve this will be to focus on refining the `flood_fill` function to properly contain the fill operation within the outlined regions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze `flood_fill`:** The primary issue is with how `flood_fill` propagates. It seems to be based on a simple breadth-first search, but this approach doesn't account for the newly created azure outline *as a hard boundary*. It treats the outline as just another color to potentially overwrite.\n2.  **Prioritize Outline as Boundary:** The `flood_fill` logic needs to be modified so that azure pixels are treated as *impassable barriers*, similar to how out-of-bounds cells are handled.\n3. **Fix seeding of flood_fill** - ensure that the flood_fill operation starts inside the shapes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using conceptual analysis, code execution would happen externally):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A few irregular gray shapes on a white background.\n    *   Expected Output: Shapes outlined in azure, inner gray areas filled with red.\n    *   Actual Output:  Incorrect fill - several red pixels are miscolored.\n    *   Analysis: Flood fill not contained by the outline.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input:  More gray shapes.\n    *   Expected Output:  Shapes outlined in azure, filled with red.\n    *   Actual Output:  Incorrect fill.\n    *   Analysis: Same as Example 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input:  Different gray shape arrangement.\n    *   Expected Output: Shapes outlined in azure, filled with red.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect fill.\n    *   Analysis: Same as Example 1 and 2.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: shape\n    color: gray (5)\n    properties:\n      - contiguous: true\n      - outlineable: true\n      - fillable: true\n  - name: outline\n    color: azure (8)\n    properties:\n      - boundary: true\n      - generated: true # Derived, not present in original input\n  - name: fill\n    color: red (2)\n    properties:\n      - interior: true\n      - generated: true  # Derived\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_shapes\n    input: input_grid\n    output: list_of_shapes\n    description: Find all contiguous gray regions.\n  - name: outline\n    input: shape, input_grid\n    output: outlined_grid\n    description: Replace boundary gray pixels with azure.\n  - name: fill\n    input: outlined_grid, shape\n    output: filled_grid\n    description: Replace interior gray pixels with red, bounded by azure.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Shapes:** Identify all distinct, contiguous regions (shapes) of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Outline Shapes:** For each identified gray shape:\n    *   Iterate through all pixels of the shape.\n    *   If a gray pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is *not* part of the *same* shape (either a different color or out of bounds), replace it with azure (8). This creates an outline around each shape.\n\n3.  **Fill Shapes:** For each outlined shape:\n    * find seed points, defined as gray points that are adjacent to the boundary.\n    *   Use a flood-fill algorithm, starting from any internal points, to replace all interior, connected, gray (5) pixels with red (2).\n    *   *Crucially*, the flood fill must *stop* when it encounters an azure (8) pixel (the outline) or the boundary of the grid. The outline acts as a strict boundary for the fill operation.\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged throughout the entire process.\n"
