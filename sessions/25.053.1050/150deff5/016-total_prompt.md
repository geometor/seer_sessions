Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Foreground:** Find the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels. This constitutes the foreground shape.

2.  **Identify the Background:** All pixels that are *not* part of the foreground shape are considered the background. The background does not change.

3.  **Determine the Outline:** A gray pixel is part of the *outline* if it's directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one non-gray pixel.

4.  **Determine the Inside:** A gray pixel is part of the *inside* if:
    *   It is part of the foreground shape, AND
    *   It is NOT part of the outline, AND
    *    It is completely surrounded by outline or other inside pixels, meaning all 4 neighbors are other "inside" pixels, outline pixels, or outside of grid bounds. This is the key improvement - a flood-fill like approach is suggested.

5.  **Recolor the Outline:** Change the color of all outline pixels to azure (8).

6.  **Recolor the Inside:** Change the color of all inside pixels to red (2).

7.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all non-gray input pixels remain unchanged in the output.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The core issue is that the `is_inside` function doesn't correctly identify "inside" pixels. It relies too heavily on all neighbors being either gray or out of bounds. It does correctly identify the outline, and it does correctly identify the background. The errors that occur seem to happen around the edges of shapes, especially where a grey colored shape touches the edge of the input grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine `is_inside`:** The current `is_inside` function is too restrictive. A better definition of an "inside" pixel is: a gray pixel that *is not* part of the outline. We should remove the condition of it being completely surrounded by "inside" or out of bounds pixels from the existing function.
2. **Test Cases:** Run all examples again and re-evaluate

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection, since code execution isn't directly available in this turn):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 11
    *   Issue: The function has trouble with corners and edges.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Pixels off: 8
    *   Issue: More edge problems.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Pixels Off: 10
    *   Issue: The color is incorrect, but this could be due to a misinterpretation. The shape appears to be identified as all outline.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
task: 014_outline_and_fill
objects:
  - id: foreground
    color: gray (5)
    property: shape
    attributes:
      - outline
      - inside
  - id: background
    color: varies
    property: static
actions:
  - subject: foreground outline
    verb: recolor
    color: azure (8)
  - subject: foreground inside
    verb: recolor
    color: red (2)
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Foreground:** Find the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels. This constitutes the foreground shape.

2.  **Identify the Background:** All pixels that are *not* part of the foreground shape are considered the background. The background does not change.

3.  **Determine the Outline:** A gray pixel is part of the *outline* if it's directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one non-gray pixel, or it is adjacent to the border of the image.

4.  **Determine the Inside:** A gray pixel is part of the *inside* if:
    *   It is part of the foreground shape, AND
    *   It is NOT part of the outline.

5.  **Recolor the Outline:** Change the color of all outline pixels to azure (8).

6.  **Recolor the Inside:** Change the color of all inside pixels to red (2).

7.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all non-gray input pixels remain unchanged in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
