# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7745ECFFBCD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - cell_values: [0-9] representing colors
  - object: azure_pixels
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: dispersed, potentially forming multiple sub-objects
    actions:
      - None:  # Azure pixels themselves don't seem to be modified
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: appears as single pixels
    actions:
       - introduced:  # Blue pixels are added; they do not exist in the initial state
    relationships:
      - adjacency: blue pixels are placed adjacent to azure pixels.
      - location: It appears blue pixels replace white pixels where the white pixels are adjacent to an azure pixel, and it appears the transformation works inward from the upper left and the lower right.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Identify:** Identify the positions of all azure colored pixels.
3. **Locate:** Locate all white colored pixels adjacent to the azure ones
4. **Check:** Working from upper left and lower right, determine if a white pixel that is adjecent to an azure pixel, has an azure neighbor to the left and or the right.
5.  **Transformation:** If the condition in step 4 is met for a white pixel, change the value/color to blue (1). If multiple white pixels next to azure qualify, transform one at a time, working in from the upper left and lower right.
6.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

Essentially the rule appears to fill inwards, converting white to blue, in a zig-zag manner, working inwards from two corners.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
