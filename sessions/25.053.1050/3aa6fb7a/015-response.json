            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for refining the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code were too simplistic. While the core idea of checking for azure pixels to the left and right of white pixels was correct, the implementation failed to correctly apply this rule. The code only *checked* for azure pixels, but did not *require* azure on both sides. It seems the code (or the prompt to the code generator) skipped the critical \"and\" condition.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Reiterate and Refine:** The natural language program must very clearly articulate the *conditional* rule. It MUST have azure on both sides.\n2.  **Code Modification:** The Python code needs to be updated to strictly enforce the \"azure on both sides\" condition. The current code has bugs in it.\n3.  **Thorough Testing:** After modifying the code, it's crucial to re-test against *all* provided examples to ensure the fix works universally, not just on a single case.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a more precise analysis of *why* the transformation failed:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Expected Changes: Two white (0) pixels should become blue (1).\n    *   Actual Changes: No changes occurred, therefore all the conditional transforms are missed.\n    *   Error Analysis: code does not transform any pixel - clearly missing the\n        `if left_azure and right_azure` - it never gets set.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Expected Changes: Three white (0) pixels should become blue (1).\n    *   Actual Changes: Zero changes.\n    *   Error Analysis: Again, the condition `if left_azure and right_azure`\n        does not get satisfied, and nothing is changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: 7\n      columns: 7\n      colors: [0, 1, 8] # white, blue, azure\n  - type: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        white: 0\n        blue: 1\n        azure: 8\n\ntransformations:\n  - rule: \"A white pixel changes to blue if and only if there are azure pixels both to its left and to its right on the same row.\"\n    conditions:\n      - left_azure: \"An azure pixel exists to the left of the white pixel on the same row.\"\n      - right_azure: \"An azure pixel exists to the right of the white pixel on the same row.\"\n    action: \"Change the white pixel to blue.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Locate all white (0) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Iterate:** For each white pixel, examine its entire row.\n3.  **Condition:** A white pixel changes to blue (1) if, and *only* if, there are azure pixels present both to its left and to its right anywhere on the *same* row. Note, it does not have to be the *immediate* neighbor, just *somewhere* to the left and right on that row.\n4.  **Output:** The modified grid constitutes the output, where qualifying white pixels have been replaced by blue pixels.\n"
