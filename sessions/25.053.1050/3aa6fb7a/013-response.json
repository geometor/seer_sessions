            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While the core idea of checking for azure neighbors on the left and right of white pixels is correct, the code failed to account for *all* instances where this condition is met. It appears the error is in the strict interpretation and immediate application of the rule. The algorithm correctly identifies the white pixel and the existence of adjacent azure pixels, but the code only replaces with blue if the next immediate value is azure. A more thorough check across the row is needed.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Carefully study *all* training examples to ensure a complete understanding of the transformation rule. Pay very close attention to *all* positions of the white pixels.\n2.  **Broaden the neighborhood check:** Instead of only checking the *immediate* left and right neighbors, the logic must consider *all* azure pixels on the *same* row.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, along with some generated metrics:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)\n*   **Output Shape:** (7, 7)\n*   **White Pixels Input:** 37\n*   **White Pixels Output:** 35\n*   **Azure Pixels Input:** 4\n*   **Azure Pixels Output:** 4\n*   **Blue Pixels Input:** 0\n*   **Blue Pixels Output:** 2\n*   **Mismatched Pixels:** 2 at (1,2) and (4,4)\n* **Observation:** only looks at the immediate neighbors\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)\n*   **Output Shape:** (7, 7)\n*   **White Pixels Input:** 37\n*   **White Pixels Output:** 34\n*   **Azure Pixels Input:** 6\n*   **Azure Pixels Output:** 6\n*   **Blue Pixels Input:** 0\n*   **Blue Pixels Output:** 3\n*   **Mismatched Pixels:** 3 at (1,4), (2,3), and (5, 3)\n* **Observation:** only looks at the immediate neighbors\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 012\nobjects:\n  - color: white\n    role: target\n    properties:\n      changeable: True\n  - color: azure\n    role: trigger\n    properties:\n      adjacency_check: same_row\n  - color: blue\n    role: result\n    properties:\n      replacement_color: white\n\nactions:\n  - type: color_change\n    condition: \"white pixel has azure pixels to its left AND right on the same row\"\n    from_color: white\n    to_color: blue\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Locate all white (0) and azure (8) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Iterate:** For each white pixel, examine its entire row.\n3.  **Condition:** A white pixel changes to blue (1) if, and *only* if, there are azure pixels present both to its left and to its right anywhere on the *same* row. Note, it does not have to be the *immediate* neighbor, just *somewhere* to the left and right on that row.\n4.  **Output:** The modified grid constitutes the output, where qualifying white pixels have been replaced by blue pixels.\n"
