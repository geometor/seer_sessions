Both grids have the same dimensions (9x9 in this example). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors present are white (0), red (2), blue (1), yellow (4) and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve the creation of new colored objects around existing colored objects, possibly based on some kind of \"influence\" or \"expansion\" rule.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
