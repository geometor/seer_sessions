The input grid seems to have a few distinct colored pixels (red, blue, magenta) scattered within a background of white pixels (represented by 0). The output grid introduces new colors (yellow, orange) and expands on the placement of some existing input colors, specifically around the blue pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Place a yellow pixel above and one to the left of the red pixel.\n\n3.  **Add Orange Around Blue:** Place orange pixels (color 7) to form an \"L\" pattern centered on the blue pixel, as follow: one to its left, one below, one to its right and one below that one.\n\n4.  **Preserve original non-zero pixels:** All other pixels from the input grid, except zero, should remain in the same position and retain their original color in the output grid. Zero value pixels remain the same unless transformed.\n"
