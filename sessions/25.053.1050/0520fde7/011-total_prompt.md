Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1. Ignore the Central Column: Disregard the central column of the input grid, which is filled with gray (5) pixels.
2. Identify Blue Regions: Focus on the blue (1) pixels in the remaining parts of the input grid.
3. Translate and Replace: Create a new 3x3 grid. Map the blue pixels from the relevant part of the input grid to the new grid, changing their color to red (2). All other pixels in the output grid should be white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
