examples:
  - input_size: [3, 7]
    output_size: [3, 3]
    output_colors: [0, 2]

        The output is a 3x3 grid. The values of the output grid are based on the value of 0 in the input.
        The center column is determined by dividing the input by 2.
        The center row is not important for determining the rule.
        If there is a 0 in the input at position (row, center column + col), then the output grid at position (row, col) should have a value of 2.
        Otherwise, if the grid does not have a value of 0, then the output grid should have a value of 0.

      positions with value 0 in the input grid determine the value of 2 in the output grid.
      The center column is determined by dividing the input by 2.
      The center row is not important for determining the rule.
      if (row, center col + col) == 0, then (row, col) of output is 2.

        The output is a 3x3 grid.
        The center column of the input grid is determined by integer division by 2.
        Pixels with color value 2 in output have coordinates(r, c) where input grid has color value 0 at (r, c + center col) .
        All other pixels in the output are color value 0.
