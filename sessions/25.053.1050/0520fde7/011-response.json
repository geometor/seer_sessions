            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code were partially correct in identifying the core concept: ignoring the central gray column and focusing on blue pixels. However, it incorrectly mapped the blue pixels. The provided code remaps based on the x position index into the non-gray column indices. Instead it should maintain the 2D relationships of the blue pixels to the gray column. The current implementation does not handle the spatial relationships.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Spatial Relationships:** The core issue is how the blue pixels are mapped to the output grid. The current code uses the raw column index, which is wrong. We must understand that the non-central columns form two distinct regions: to the left of the central column, and two the right.\n2.  **Refine Column Extraction:** Currently all columns are extracted except the central column. This should be separated into regions: left and right, and those regions remapped to a 3x3 grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical `code_execution` results):**\n\nI'll assume a `code_execution` module that provides detailed information. In a real scenario, I would interactively execute code snippets to verify these observations.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Blue pixels (input): (0,0), (0, 5), (1,1), (1, 4), (1,5), (1,6)\n    *   Blue pixels to the Left of Central Column: (0,0), (1,1)\n    *   Blue pixels to the Right of Central Column: (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n    *   Gray column index: 3\n    *   Non-gray columns with blue pixels: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Expected red pixels (output): (1,1)\n    *   Actual red pixels: many, incorrect positions\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Blue pixels (input): (0,0), (0,1), (0,5), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,5)\n    *   Blue pixels to the Left of Central Column: (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\n    *   Blue pixels to the Right of Central Column: (0,5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2,5)\n    *   Gray column index: 3\n    *   Non-gray columns with blue pixels: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   Expected red pixels (output): (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)\n    *   Actual red pixels: many, incorrect positions.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Blue pixels (input): (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2,4), (2,6)\n    *   Blue pixels to the Left of Central Column: (0,2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)\n    *   Blue pixels to the Right of Central Column:(1, 4), (1, 6), (2,4), (2,6)\n    *   Gray column index: 3\n    *   Non-gray columns with blue pixels: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.\n    *   Expected red pixels (output): (1, 0), (2, 2)\n    *   Actual red pixels: many, incorrect positions\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      shape: variable (rows, cols)\n      colors: [0, 1, 5]  # white, blue, gray\n      center_column:\n        color: 5  # gray\n        index: cols // 2\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      shape: (3, 3)\n      colors: [0, 2]  # white, red\n\n  - name: blue_regions\n    type: object_group\n    properties:\n      color: 1 #Blue\n      locations:\n        left: [] # coordinates of blue relative to the central column\n        right: []\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_center_column\n    description: Find the central column index in the input grid.\n\n  - name: identify_blue_regions\n    description: Locate blue (1) pixels to the left and right.\n\n  - name: create_output_grid\n    description: Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).\n\n  - name: map_blue_to_red\n    description: >\n      Map coordinates of blue pixels relative to the central column.\n      Left region maps to left side of output.

Record their positions relative to the central column.\n\n4. **Create output grid:** create a 3x3 grid filled with white pixels.\n\n5.  **Map and Transform:**\n    *   **Left Region:** Map the blue pixels' positions to the corresponding positions on the left side (columns 0 and 1) of the 3x3 output grid. Change these pixels to red (2).\n    *  **Right Region:** Map the relative positions of the blue pixels from the right hand side to the right columns (1 and 2) in the output grid. Change these pixels to red (2).\n    *   Ensure that pixels not occupied by the transformation are set to white (0).\n"
