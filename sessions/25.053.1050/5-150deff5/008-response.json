This creates an outline around each shape.\n\n3.  **Fill Shapes:** For each outlined shape:\n    *   find seed points, defined as gray points that are adjacent to the boundary.\n    *   Use a flood-fill algorithm, starting from any internal points, to replace all interior, connected, gray (5) pixels with red (2).\n    *   *Crucially*, the flood fill must *stop* when it encounters an azure (8) pixel (the outline) or the boundary of the grid. The outline acts as a strict boundary for the fill operation.\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all pixels that were originally white (0) remain unchanged throughout the entire process.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_shapes(grid, shape_color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous regions of the specified color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    shapes = []\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_shape):\n        if not is_valid(r, c) or visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != shape_color:\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        current_shape.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, current_shape)\n\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if grid[row, col] == shape_color and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_shape = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_shape)\n                shapes.append(current_shape)\n    return shapes\n\ndef outline_shape(grid, shape, outline_color):\n    \"\"\"Outlines a single shape with the specified color.\"\"\"\n    outlined_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    for r, c in shape:\n        is_outline = False\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if not (0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]) or (nr, nc) not in shape:\n                is_outline = True\n                break\n        if is_outline:\n            outlined_grid[r, c] = outline_color\n    return outlined_grid\n\ndef flood_fill(grid, shape, fill_color, outline_color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Flood fills the interior of a shape, respecting the outline.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    filled_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    visited = set()\n    q = deque()\n\n    # Find seed points (gray pixels adjacent to non-gray pixels)\n    for r, c in shape:\n        if filled_grid[r,c] == outline_color:\n            continue # skip outline\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if not (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and (nr,nc) in shape ):\n                #seed if adjacent to the boundary\n                q.append((r,c))\n                visited.add((r,c))\n                break\n\n    while q:\n        r, c = q.popleft()\n        filled_grid[r,c] = fill_color #always fill\n\n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            #stay in bounds, is not visited, and must be gray\n            if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and\n                (nr, nc) not in visited and filled_grid[nr,nc] != outline_color and (nr,nc) in shape):\n                q.append((nr, nc))\n                visited.add((nr, nc))\n    return filled_grid\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions and background as input_grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    shape_color = 5\n    outline_color = 8\n    fill_color = 2\n\n    # Find all distinct shapes.\n    shapes = find_shapes(input_grid, shape_color)\n\n    # Outline and then fill each shape\n    for shape in shapes:\n        output_grid = outline_shape(output_grid, shape, outline_color)\n    \n    for shape in shapes:\n        output_grid = flood_fill(output_grid,shape, fill_color, outline_color)\n        \n\n    return output_grid\n```"
