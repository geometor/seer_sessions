The primary object appears to be a shape formed by gray (5) pixels in the input. This shape seems to be analyzed and re-represented with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels in the output. The background is consistently white (0) in both input and output. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct color substitution. Instead, it appears to be segmenting and recoloring portions of the original gray shape. The azure (8) pixels seem to outline part of the gray (5) figure, and the red (2) seems to define an inner, different-colored region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
