Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Shapes:** Find all distinct, contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.  Each of these regions is considered a separate "shape."
2.  **Outline Each Shape:** For each identified shape:
    *   Iterate through all pixels within the shape.
    *   A gray pixel is part of the *outline* if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is *not* part of the *same* gray shape (either a different color or out of bounds).
    *   Replace all outline pixels of the shape with azure (8).
3.  **Fill Each Shape:** For each outlined shape:
    * fill the interior by flood filling from the edges inward, changing all gray pixels to red (2) until the azure outline is met.
4.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
