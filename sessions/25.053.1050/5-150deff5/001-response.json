The primary element is a recognizable shape formed by gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This shape seems to be the focus of the transformation. The output grid retains the overall structure and dimensions of the input grid, but the gray shape is altered. Specifically, the gray pixels are replaced with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The azure pixels appear to trace the outline of the original gray shape, while the red pixels fill the interior. The background (white, 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
