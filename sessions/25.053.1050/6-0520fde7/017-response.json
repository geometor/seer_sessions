The input grid appears to be larger (7x3) than the output grid (3x3). The colors in the input include white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The output grid includes white (0) and red (2).  The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple sub-region selection, as the spatial arrangement of colors changes significantly. The gray (5) column in the input is removed, and the blue (1) somehow becomes the red (2).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
