Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Excise:** Remove the fourth column (the gray column) from the input grid.
2.  **Condense:** Create a 3x3 output grid. For each row, select the first three non-gray color values to fill output.
3. **Color Conversion:** Examine each cell in the *output* grid.
   * Change cell to red if:
     * Output cell is blue
     * Output cell is not at an edge of the grid
     * The cell immediately to the left and right of the cell are not blue
     * The cell immediately to the top and bottom of the cell are not blue

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
