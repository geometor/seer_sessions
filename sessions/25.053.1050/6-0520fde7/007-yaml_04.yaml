    - input_grid:
        description: A 2D array of varying dimensions.
        properties:
          - Contains integers 0-9, representing colors.
          - Width can vary.
          - Height can vary.
    - output_grid:
      description: A 2D array with dimensions 3x3.
      properties:
        - Contains only integers 0 and 2, representing white and red.
  - actions:
    - Find_center: locate the middle of input
    - map_pixels:
      description: Create output grid based on input
      details:
        - positions of red pixels (2) in the output grid depend on a specific relationship to the positions of black pixels (0) in the input grid and also on their position in the input row, relative to a point 3 to the left of the right hand edge of the input.
  - observations:
      - "The output grid is always 3x3."
      - "The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels."
      - "Red pixels (value 2) are place in the output based on the position of
        white pixels (value 0) in the input."
      - "The position of input white pixels relative to the right side of input grid impacts placement"
