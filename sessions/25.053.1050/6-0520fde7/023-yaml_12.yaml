observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable in input, 3x3 in output
      - cell_values: integers representing colors (0-9)
      - fourth_column: contains only the value 5 (gray) in all the examples
    actions:
      - remove_column: The fourth column is consistently removed.
      - condense: Input grid collapses to a 3x3 output grid.
      - color_conversion_selective_blue:
          description: Blue pixels change to red under specific conditions.
          conditions:
            - column_based: The first and third columns often trigger blue-to-red conversion, BUT NOT ALWAYS.
            - neighbors: Neighboring colors and row positions *may* influence the conversion, but no consistent pattern is apparent with current examples.
