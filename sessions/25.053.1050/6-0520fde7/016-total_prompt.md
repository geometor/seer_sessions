Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Column:** Find the vertical column in the input grid that contains only gray (5) pixels. This column divides the input grid into left and right regions.

2.  **Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.

3.  **Locate Key Blue Pixels:** Examine the input grid for blue pixels (1) that are exactly *one* cell away (horizontally) from the central gray column, either to the left or the right. Ignore other blue pixels.

4.  **Transform and Map:**
    *   For each blue pixel found in step 3:
        *   If the blue pixel is one cell to the *left* of the central column, place a red pixel (2) in the same row, and *first* column of the output grid.
        *   If the blue pixel is one cell to the *right* of the central column, place a red pixel (2) in the same row, and the *third* column of the output grid.
        *   The y-coordinate of the red pixel should be equal to the y coordinate of the blue pixel.

5.  The central column in the output will always be white (0).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a limited understanding derived from the first training example.  The subsequent tests on the other training examples reveal inconsistencies.  The core issue is that the initial program incorrectly assumes that the output grid's red pixel placement *always* corresponds directly to the *row* of the triggering blue pixel in the input. The test results clearly show this isn't true; the output is always a 3x3 grid, and the y-coordinate of the red pixel on the output grid depends upon the y-coordinate of the blue pixel on the *input* grid.

The strategy to fix this is as follows:

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The program must be rebuilt around the constant 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Refine Mapping Logic:** The updated program needs to clarify how input blue pixel positions determine the *fixed* output positions of the red pixels. It's not a row-to-row mapping, but rather based upon the relative positions of the blue pixels relative to the gray column and mapping the blue pixels y-value to the output grid's y-value.
3. **Iterate and Test:** The code changes should be minimal to prevent the introduction of more issues.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

I don't need to execute code to gather the critical information. The provided results are sufficient for analysis, and further code execution at this stage (without modified code) would be redundant. Here's the analysis based on the provided output:

*   **Example 1:** The output grid is 3x3. The input has a gray column.  The code incorrectly places the red pixel in the (1,2) instead of (1,0). There is a blue pixel to the left of the gray column (at 0,0) which should create a red pixel in output grid column 0. There is a blue pixel to the right of the gray column on row 1. It does not place a red pixel in (0,0) where there should be one, based on the input's blue pixel at (0, 5).
*   **Example 2:** The output grid is 3x3.  The input has a gray column.  The red pixels are again incorrectly placed relative to the blue pixel's *row*. There are errors in all three rows.
*   **Example 3:** The output grid is 3x3, and the input has a gray column. The red pixels placements are again not correct.

**YAML Fact Extraction**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "014"
  - input_grid_has_gray_column: true  # All training examples have it.
  - output_grid_size: [3, 3]  # All output grids are 3x3.
  - output_grid_center_column_always_white: true # All output center is 0
  - input_blue_pixels_trigger_output: true
  - blue_pixel_left_of_gray:
      output_column: 0  # Red pixel in column 0
  - blue_pixel_right_of_gray:
      output_column: 2  # Red pixel in column 2
  - input_blue_y_equals_output_red_y: true
  - output_red_color: 2  # Output pixels are red.
  - output_other_color: 0   # All non-red pixels are white (0)
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Central Column Identification:** Find the vertical column in the *input* grid that consists only of gray (5) pixels. This column serves as a reference.

2.  **Output Grid Initialization:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.

3.  **Blue Pixel Detection:** Examine the *input* grid for blue (1) pixels that are directly adjacent (horizontally) to the central gray column.

4.  **Conditional Red Pixel Placement:**
    *   For each blue pixel found in step 3:
        *   If the blue pixel is one cell to the *left* of the central gray column, place a red (2) pixel in the *first* column (index 0) of the *output* grid. The row of the red pixel in the output grid is the *same* as the row of the blue pixel in the input grid.
        *   If the blue pixel is one cell to the *right* of the central gray column, place a red (2) pixel in the *third* column (index 2) of the *output* grid.  The row of the red pixel in the output grid is the *same* as the row of the blue pixel in the input grid.

5.  The central column (index 1) of the output grid always remains white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
