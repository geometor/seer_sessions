# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7745EC576740>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7745EA7402B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger (7x3) than the output grid (3x3). The colors in the input include white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The output grid includes white (0) and red (2).  The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple sub-region selection, as the spatial arrangement of colors changes significantly. The gray (5) column in the input is removed, and the blue (1) somehow becomes the red (2).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 7x3, output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Input grid colors are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
  - observation: Output grid colors are white (0) and red (2).
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x3
      colors: [0, 1, 5]
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2]
  - action: Transformation
    description: Converts input grid to output grid.
    details:
      - Removes the fourth column, which is gray (5).
      - Changes blue (1) in specific position to red (2).
  - relationship: Spatial arrangement changes.
  - hypothesis: "1" changes to "2" when bordered by at least two "0" of opposite type, i.e. horizontal or vertical
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Excise Column:** Remove the fourth column (all gray/5s) of the input grid.
2.  **Condense:** Reduce to a 3x3 grid by:
    - copying the "left half" (first three numbers), skipping any complete blue (1) vertical columns.
3. **Color Conversion:** The blue cells (1) bordered on two sides (either vertical or horizontal, not diagonal) are changed to color red(2)


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
