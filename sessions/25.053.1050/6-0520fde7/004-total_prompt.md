```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Feature:** Locate the vertical gray stripe (all pixels with color value 5) running down the center of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Central Region:** Consider a 3x3 sub-grid centered on the overall input.
3.  Count the blue pixels in the input
4.  **Determine Center Color** If the count of blue pixel is greater than 2. Set output central pixel color to be red (2)
5.  Fill all other pixels in the output with color value white (0).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and generated code were too simplistic. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on the subsequent ones. The core issue is that the logic only considers the total count of blue pixels and sets the center pixel based on that. It doesn't account for the spatial arrangement of blue pixels relative to the gray stripe, or any other potential patterns. The expected outputs of examples 2 & 3 have red pixels (color 2) where there are no blue pixels (color 1) in the corresponding input, which the current code doesn't account for. The grey stripe is a distractor.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: I need to shift the focus from simply counting blue pixels to understanding the relationship between the *positions* of certain colors in the input and output.
2.  **Refine Object Identification**: The current code is only counting blue pixels. It needs consider the position of other pixel colors.
3.  **Iterative Program Update**: The natural language program should be revised to reflect the positional relationships and create a more complex conditional logic.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution for analysis - not possible here but would be in practice):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Blue Count: 4
    *   Input Grey Stripe Column: 3
    *   Output Red Pixel: (1,1) - center
    *   Result: Correct.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Blue Count: 5
    *   Input Grey Stripe Column: 3
    *   Output Red Pixels: (0,1), (2,1) and (1,2)
    *   Result: Incorrect. The existing logic *only* considers the blue count, not position.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Blue Count: 5
    *   Input Grey Stripe Column: 3
    *   Output Red Pixels: (1,0) and (2,2)
    *   Result: Incorrect. Similar to Example 2, positional logic is missing.

**YAML Fact Base:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: 002
  - example_1:
      input_grid_size: (3, 7)
      output_grid_size: (3, 3)
      input_blue_count: 4
      output_red_positions: [(1, 1)]
      grey_stripe_present: true
      grey_stripe_column: 3
  - example_2:
      input_grid_size: (3, 7)
      output_grid_size: (3, 3)
      input_blue_count: 5
      output_red_positions: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2,1)]
      grey_stripe_present: true
      grey_stripe_column: 3
  - example_3:
      input_grid_size: (3, 7)
      output_grid_size: (3, 3)
      input_blue_count: 5
      output_red_positions: [(1, 0), (2,2)]
      grey_stripe_present: true
      grey_stripe_column: 3
  - common:
      output_size: (3,3)
      output_colors: [0, 2] # White and Red
      input_colors: [0,1,5]
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white pixels (color 0).

2.  Locate zero value pixels in input.

3.  **Iterate through zero value pixels**:
  *   if a zero value pixel in the input aligns with the output origin (0,0) and a color of 2 in the output, set the corresponding output to 2.
  *   if a zero value pixel in the input aligns with the output center (1,1) and a color of 2 in the output, set the corresponding output to 2.
  *   if a zero value pixel in the input aligns with the bottom right of the output (2,2) and a color of 2 in the output, set the corresponding output to 2.

4. **Return the output grid**

**Reasoning for Revised Program:**

The grey stripe and the blue pixels counts are irrelevant. Look at where the zero value pixels are in input relative to the placement of the red pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
