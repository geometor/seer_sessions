There's no change in the overall set of digits used, they have not changed.\n*    **Shape:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   **Orientation**: It appears that the orientation of the entire grid has been rotated, specifically by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
