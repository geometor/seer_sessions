    Two pixels of color azure (8) in the input are changed to blue (1) in the output.
    The shape and count of azure pixels remain the same.
    The shape remains unchanged.

observations:
  - "The transformation involves changing the color of some azure (8) pixels to blue (1)."
  - "The number of azure pixels remains constant, suggesting replacement rather than removal or addition."
  - "Visually, it appears that the pixels changed are within the boundaries of the azure regions, but not on the 'edges' or 'corners'." # Refine this observation later if needed
