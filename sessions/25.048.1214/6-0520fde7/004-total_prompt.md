Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: (3, 7)
  objects:
    blue_objects:
      count: 5
      positions: [(0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1,6), (2, 0)]
    gray_objects:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
    white_objects:
      count: 13
      positions:  [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2,7)]

output_grid:
  size: (3, 3)
  objects:
    red_object:
      count: 1
      position: [(1, 1)]
    white_objects:
      count: 8

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify the Central Column:** Observe the input grid and locate the vertical column of gray (5) objects. This column acts as a central axis.

2.  **Extract a 3x3 Subgrid:** Create a 3x3 grid centered around the middle gray object. Specifically, take the coordinates of the central gray object (1, 3), and construct a new grid that includes one row and one column above and below this center point.

3. **Change the color:** In the new grid the central cell will change to the color red (2)

4.  **Clear Other Colors:** All cells in the subgrid, are changed to white (0) other than the central cell.

**Inferred Transformation Rule**

The transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid centered on the middle gray object of the original grid. All the cells are colored white (0), other than the central pixel that is colored red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
