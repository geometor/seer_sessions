            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this third transformation. It appears to build upon the rules established in the previous two examples.\n\n**YAML Description of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: 9x9\n  objects:\n    red_object:\n      color: 2 (red)\n      shape: 1x1\n      position: (2,2)\n    blue_object:\n      color: 1 (blue)\n      shape: 1x1\n      position: (7,3)\n    magenta_object:\n      color: 6 (magenta)\n      shape: 1x1\n      position: (5,6)\n    background:\n      color: 0 (white)\n      shape: 9x9\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: 9x9\n  objects:\n    red_object:\n      color: 2 (red)\n      shape: 1x1\n      position: (2,2)\n    blue_object:\n      color: 1 (blue)\n      shape: 1x1\n      position: (7,3)\n    yellow_object:\n      color: 4 (yellow)\n      shape: cross-like\n      position: around red object at (2,2)\n    orange_object:\n      color: 7 (orange)\n      shape: cross-like\n      position: around blue object at (7,3)\n    magenta_object:\n      color: 6 (magenta)\n      shape: 1x1\n      position: (5,6)\n    background:\n      color: 0 (white)\n      shape: 9x9\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all single-pixel red (color 2) and blue (color 1) objects within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Red Object Transformation:**  For each red object, create a yellow 2x2 cross shape centered around the original red pixel's location.\n\n3.  **Blue Object Transformation:** For each blue object, draw an orange cross with arms of one cell length.\n\n4.  **Preserve:** The original red and blue pixels are preserved. Other single-pixel objects (in this case, the magenta object) and the background remain unchanged.\n\n**Inferred Rule Summary**\n\nThis transformation reinforces the previously established rule: red pixels get a surrounding yellow cross; blue pixels get a surrounding orange cross; other colors and the background are unchanged. The magenta pixel, not being red or blue, is unaffected by the transformation.  The presence of the magenta object confirms that the rule specifically targets red and blue objects and leaves others untouched.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule identifies all single-pixel red and blue objects.  A 2x2 yellow shape, cross-like, is drawn, centered on each red object's original location, and a cross of orange color, with arms of length 1 cell is created around each blue object's location.  The red and blue pixels are preserved. All other single pixels objects with distinct colors and the background remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_all_objects(grid, color):\n    # Find the coordinates of *all* single-pixel objects of the specified color.\n    coords = np.where(grid == color)\n    return list(zip(coords[0], coords[1]))\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find all red objects (color 2).\n    red_positions = find_all_objects(input_grid, 2)\n    for red_pos in red_positions:\n        # Draw a yellow cross around each red object\n        row, col = red_pos\n        for i in range(-1,2):\n            output_grid[row+i, col] = 4 if abs(i) == 1 else output_grid[row+i,col]\n            output_grid[row, col+i] = 4 if abs(i) == 1 else output_grid[row,col+i]\n\n\n    # Find all blue objects (color 1).\n    blue_positions = find_all_objects(input_grid, 1)\n    for blue_pos in blue_positions:\n         # Draw an orange cross centered on each blue object.\n        row, col = blue_pos\n        for i in range(-1, 2):\n            output_grid[row + i, col] = 7 if abs(i)==1 else output_grid[row + i, col]\n            output_grid[row, col + i] = 7 if abs(i) == 1 else output_grid[row, col+i]\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
