A \"thick\" or \"blocky\" S.\n      position: Occupies a similar area as the input shape 5.\n      count: 1\n    - color: 2\n      shape: replaces parts of the shape 8.\n      position: fills some parts.\n      count: 1\n    - color: 0\n      shape: Background\n      position: Fills the remaining cells.\n      count: 1\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the single connected object composed of color 5 in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Change to 8:** all the color 5 is changed to 8.\n\n3.  **Substitution by Component**: the object, now composed by the color 8, has some part replaced by color 2, according to the rule: Every cell color 8 that form an horizontal line of 3 cells long, has the center cell changed to color 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation Applied to Input**\n\n1. **Input**: A shape with a \"thick\" S, made by gray color 5.\n\n2. **Change to 8:** The gray shape is changed to azure color 8.\n\n3.  **Replacement:** The new shape with color 8, had the central cell, when there was a line of 3 consecutive cells, to color 2 (red).\n\n"
