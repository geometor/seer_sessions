The rule for substitution is: Every cell of color 8 that is the center of a horizontal line of three consecutive cells of color 8 is changed to color 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation Applied to Input**\n\n1.  **Input**: A shape (resembling a distorted \"F\") made of gray color (5).\n\n2.  **Change to 8:** The gray shape is changed to azure (color 8).\n\n3.  **Replacement:** Within the new shape, now azure, wherever there's a horizontal line of three consecutive azure cells, the central cell is changed to red (color 2).\n\nThe natural language program and Python function from the first example is good.\n"
