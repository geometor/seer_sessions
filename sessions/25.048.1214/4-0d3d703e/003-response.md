Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each occupying a single column and having a distinct color (red, green, and azure).

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color as follows:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9).

3.  **Preserve Structure:** The spatial structure of the objects (vertical lines) is maintained. The transformation only affects the colors.

In other words: the input colors 2, 3, 8 are replaced with 6, 4, 9 respectively.
