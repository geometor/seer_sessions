Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the second pair of input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]
      shape: "Three separate L shapes"
  size: (7, 7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]
      shape: "Three separate L shapes"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
      shape: "Three isolated 1x1 pixels"
  size: (7, 7)
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule, focusing on objects, predicates, and actions:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, there are three azure (color 8) objects, each forming an "L" shape.

2.  **Detect Azure to Blue Changes:**  Certain azure pixels change to blue (color 1).

3.  **Determine Rule:** The rule is the same as before: the top-right corner pixel of each "L"-shaped azure object changes to blue (color 1).

4.  **Apply Transformation:**
    *   For the first L-shaped object, the top-right corner is at (1, 4), and it changes from 8 to 1.
    *   For the second L-shaped object, the top-right corner is at (2, 3), and it changes from 8 to 1.
    *   For the third L-shaped object, the top-right corner is at (5, 3), and it changes from 8 to 1.

**Summary**

The transformation consistently identifies "L"-shaped azure (8) objects and changes the color of their top-right corner pixel to blue (1). The provided Python code should correctly handle this case as well.
