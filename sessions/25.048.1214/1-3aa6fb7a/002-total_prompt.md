Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and one L shape"
  size: (7,7)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)]
      shape: "Two separate 2x1 vertical shapes and one L shape"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: "Two, 1x1 isolated pixels"
  size: (7,7)
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation rule, focusing on objects, predicates, and actions:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can observe azure (color 8) objects.

2.  **Detect Azure to Blue Changes**: Some of the azure pixels change to blue pixels (color 1).

3. **Determine Rule**: The rule for changing color is: the top-right corner pixel, when the object looks like an 'L', changes to blue (color 1).

4. **Apply transformation**:
    *   In the first object, the top-right corner is at (1,2) changes from 8 to 1.
    *   In the second object, the top-right corner is at (5,3), relative to the top-left corner, changes from 8 to 1.

**Summary**

The transformation identifies "L"-shaped azure (8) objects and change to blue (color 1) its upper-right corner.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
