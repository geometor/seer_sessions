**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Sizes:** All examples take a 3x3 grid as input and produce a 9x9 grid as output.
2.  **Output Structure:** The 9x9 output grid can be conceptualized as a larger 3x3 grid where each cell is itself a 3x3 block of pixels.
3.  **Content Mapping:** The content of each 3x3 block in the output grid is determined by the corresponding cell in the 3x3 input grid.
4.  **Block Content Options:** Each 3x3 block in the output grid is either:
    *   An exact copy of the original 3x3 input grid.
    *   A 3x3 block filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The decision of whether to place a copy of the input grid or a white block into a specific location in the output grid depends on the properties of the color found in the corresponding input cell. Specifically, it relates to the frequency (count) of that color within the input grid.
6.  **Frequency Rule:** The key seems to be identifying the color(s) that appear *least* frequently in the input grid. If an input cell's color is one of these least frequent colors, the corresponding block in the output grid gets a copy of the input. Otherwise, the block remains white.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_pattern_replication
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  structure: composite grid of 3x3 blocks, each block is 3x3 pixels
  background_color: 0 (white)
mapping:
  input_cell_coords: (ir, ic) from 0 to 2
  output_block_coords: (br, bc) = (ir, ic)
  output_block_pixel_coords: rows ir*3 to ir*3+2, cols ic*3 to ic*3+2
rule_determination:
  based_on: color frequency analysis of the input grid
  criterion: identify the minimum frequency (N) of any non-background color present in the input grid
  target_colors: set (S) of all colors appearing exactly N times
transformation_steps:
  - initialize 9x9 output grid with background_color
  - analyze input grid to find minimum frequency N and target_colors S
  - iterate through each input cell (ir, ic):
    - get color C at input[ir][ic]
    - if C is in S:
      action: copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the output block at (br, bc) = (ir, ic)
    - else:
      action: ensure the output block at (br, bc) = (ir, ic) is filled with background_color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new 9x9 grid and fill it entirely with the background color (white, 0). This will be the output grid.
2.  Analyze the input 3x3 grid: Count the occurrences of each distinct color (ignoring the background color 0 if present).
3.  Find the smallest count obtained in step 2. Let this minimum count be `N`.
4.  Identify all the distinct colors from the input grid that appeared exactly `N` times.
5.  For each cell in the input 3x3 grid, identified by its row `ir` (from 0 to 2) and column `ic` (from 0 to 2):
    a.  Check the color `C` present in this input cell `(ir, ic)`.
    b.  Determine if color `C` is one of the colors identified in step 4 (the ones that appeared `N` times).
    c.  If color `C` *is* one of the least frequent colors (identified in step 4), then locate the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. This block starts at row `ir * 3` and column `ic * 3`. Copy the entire original 3x3 input grid into this 3x3 block.
    d.  If color `C` is *not* one of the least frequent colors, do nothing (the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid remains filled with the background color).
6.  Return the final 9x9 output grid.
