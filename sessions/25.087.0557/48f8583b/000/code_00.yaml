task_type: grid_pattern_replication
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
output_grid:
  size: 9x9
  structure: composite grid of 3x3 blocks, each block is 3x3 pixels
  background_color: 0 (white)
mapping:
  input_cell_coords: (ir, ic) from 0 to 2
  output_block_coords: (br, bc) = (ir, ic)
  output_block_pixel_coords: rows ir*3 to ir*3+2, cols ic*3 to ic*3+2
rule_determination:
  based_on: color frequency analysis of the input grid
  criterion: identify the minimum frequency (N) of any non-background color present in the input grid
  target_colors: set (S) of all colors appearing exactly N times
transformation_steps:
  - initialize 9x9 output grid with background_color
  - analyze input grid to find minimum frequency N and target_colors S
  - iterate through each input cell (ir, ic):
    - get color C at input[ir][ic]
    - if C is in S:
      action: copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the output block at (br, bc) = (ir, ic)
    - else:
      action: ensure the output block at (br, bc) = (ir, ic) is filled with background_color
