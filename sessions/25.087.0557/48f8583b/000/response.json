Specifically, it relates to the frequency (count) of that color within the input grid.\n6.  **Frequency Rule:** The key seems to be identifying the color(s) that appear *least* frequently in the input grid. If an input cell's color is one of these least frequent colors, the corresponding block in the output grid gets a copy of the input. Otherwise, the block remains white.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
