**Perception**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 5x5 output grid. Observing the examples, the transformation appears to be a non-uniform scaling or expansion process. Pixels from the input grid are mapped to blocks of varying sizes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, or 2x2) in the output grid. Specifically, the first and third rows (indices 0 and 2) of the input seem to be duplicated vertically, while the second row (index 1) is not. Similarly, the first and third columns (indices 0 and 2) of the input are duplicated horizontally, while the second column (index 1) is not. This results in the central pixel of the input mapping to a single pixel in the output, edge pixels mapping to 1x2 or 2x1 blocks, and corner pixels mapping to 2x2 blocks.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Grid Transformation (Scaling/Expansion)

Input Grid Properties:
  - Size: 3x3 (Height x Width)
  - Content: Pixels with integer color values (0-9)

Output Grid Properties:
  - Size: 5x5 (Height x Width)
  - Content: Pixels with integer color values (0-9), derived from the input grid.

Transformation Rules:
  - Row Scaling:
    - Input rows at index 0 and 2 are duplicated vertically in the output.
    - Input row at index 1 is not duplicated vertically.
    - Mapping: Input row 0 -> Output rows 0, 1. Input row 1 -> Output row 2. Input row 2 -> Output rows 3, 4.
  - Column Scaling:
    - Input columns at index 0 and 2 are duplicated horizontally in the output.
    - Input column at index 1 is not duplicated horizontally.
    - Mapping: Input col 0 -> Output cols 0, 1. Input col 1 -> Output col 2. Input col 2 -> Output cols 3, 4.
  - Pixel Mapping Detail:
    - An input pixel at (r, c) determines the color of an output block.
    - If r is 0 or 2 AND c is 0 or 2 (corners): Input pixel maps to a 2x2 block.
    - If r is 1 AND c is 0 or 2 (vertical edges): Input pixel maps to a 1x2 block.
    - If r is 0 or 2 AND c is 1 (horizontal edges): Input pixel maps to a 2x1 block.
    - If r is 1 AND c is 1 (center): Input pixel maps to a 1x1 block.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions (5x5) are derived from the input dimensions (3x3) by adding 2 to both height and width, consistent with duplicating the border rows/columns.
  - The color of each output pixel is determined solely by the color of the corresponding input pixel based on the scaling rule.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an intermediate grid by vertically scaling the 3x3 input grid to a 5x3 grid:
    *   Copy the first row (index 0) of the input grid to the first two rows (indices 0 and 1) of the intermediate grid.
    *   Copy the second row (index 1) of the input grid to the third row (index 2) of the intermediate grid.
    *   Copy the third row (index 2) of the input grid to the last two rows (indices 3 and 4) of the intermediate grid.
2.  Create the final 5x5 output grid by horizontally scaling the 5x3 intermediate grid:
    *   Copy the first column (index 0) of the intermediate grid to the first two columns (indices 0 and 1) of the output grid.
    *   Copy the second column (index 1) of the intermediate grid to the third column (index 2) of the output grid.
    *   Copy the third column (index 2) of the intermediate grid to the last two columns (indices 3 and 4) of the output grid.
3.  The resulting 5x5 grid is the final output.
