Task: Grid Transformation (Scaling/Expansion)

Input Grid Properties:
  - Size: 3x3 (Height x Width)
  - Content: Pixels with integer color values (0-9)

Output Grid Properties:
  - Size: 5x5 (Height x Width)
  - Content: Pixels with integer color values (0-9), derived from the input grid.

Transformation Rules:
  - Row Scaling:
    - Input rows at index 0 and 2 are duplicated vertically in the output.
    - Input row at index 1 is not duplicated vertically.
    - Mapping: Input row 0 -> Output rows 0, 1. Input row 1 -> Output row 2. Input row 2 -> Output rows 3, 4.
  - Column Scaling:
    - Input columns at index 0 and 2 are duplicated horizontally in the output.
    - Input column at index 1 is not duplicated horizontally.
    - Mapping: Input col 0 -> Output cols 0, 1. Input col 1 -> Output col 2. Input col 2 -> Output cols 3, 4.
  - Pixel Mapping Detail:
    - An input pixel at (r, c) determines the color of an output block.
    - If r is 0 or 2 AND c is 0 or 2 (corners): Input pixel maps to a 2x2 block.
    - If r is 1 AND c is 0 or 2 (vertical edges): Input pixel maps to a 1x2 block.
    - If r is 0 or 2 AND c is 1 (horizontal edges): Input pixel maps to a 2x1 block.
    - If r is 1 AND c is 1 (center): Input pixel maps to a 1x1 block.

Relationships:
  - The output grid dimensions (5x5) are derived from the input dimensions (3x3) by adding 2 to both height and width, consistent with duplicating the border rows/columns.
  - The color of each output pixel is determined solely by the color of the corresponding input pixel based on the scaling rule.
