            "text": "**Perception**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 input grid into a 5x5 output grid. Observing the examples, the transformation appears to be a non-uniform scaling or expansion process. Pixels from the input grid are mapped to blocks of varying sizes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, or 2x2) in the output grid. Specifically, the first and third rows (indices 0 and 2) of the input seem to be duplicated vertically, while the second row (index 1) is not. Similarly, the first and third columns (indices 0 and 2) of the input are duplicated horizontally, while the second column (index 1) is not. This results in the central pixel of the input mapping to a single pixel in the output, edge pixels mapping to 1x2 or 2x1 blocks, and corner pixels mapping to 2x2 blocks.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Input row 1 -> Output row 2. Input row 2 -> Output rows 3, 4.\n  - Column Scaling:\n    - Input columns at index 0 and 2 are duplicated horizontally in the output.\n    - Input column at index 1 is not duplicated horizontally.\n    - Mapping: Input col 0 -> Output cols 0, 1. Input col 1 -> Output col 2. Input col 2 -> Output cols 3, 4.\n  - Pixel Mapping Detail:\n    - An input pixel at (r, c) determines the color of an output block.\n    - If r is 0 or 2 AND c is 0 or 2 (corners): Input pixel maps to a 2x2 block.\n    - If r is 1 AND c is 0 or 2 (vertical edges): Input pixel maps to a 1x2 block.\n    - If r is 0 or 2 AND c is 1 (horizontal edges): Input pixel maps to a 2x1 block.\n    - If r is 1 AND c is 1 (center): Input pixel maps to a 1x1 block.\n\nRelationships:\n  - The output grid dimensions (5x5) are derived from the input dimensions (3x3) by adding 2 to both height and width, consistent with duplicating the border rows/columns.\n  - The color of each output pixel is determined solely by the color of the corresponding input pixel based on the scaling rule.\n```"
