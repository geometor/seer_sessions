input_grid:
  description: A 3x3 grid.
  properties:
    size: 3x3
    content: Contains exactly one non-white pixel and eight white (0) pixels.
    role: Selector and color source.
non_white_pixel:
  description: The single pixel in the input grid that is not white (0).
  properties:
    color: C (variable, determined from input)
    location: (r, c) within the 3x3 grid (variable, determined from input)
    role: Determines the output pattern and foreground color.
output_grid:
  description: A 9x9 grid representing the transformed input.
  properties:
    size: 9x9
    content: Composed of white (0) pixels and pixels of color C.
    structure: A specific pattern determined by the location (r, c) of the non_white_pixel in the input grid.
predefined_patterns:
  description: A set of 9 distinct, fixed 9x9 binary (0/1) patterns.
  properties:
    count: 9
    indexing: Each pattern corresponds to one of the 9 possible locations (r, c) of the non_white_pixel in the input grid.
    role: Templates for the output grid structure.
transformation:
  description: Maps the input configuration to the output grid.
  steps:
    - Identify color C and location (r, c) of the non_white_pixel in the input_grid.
    - Calculate an index `idx` based on (r, c) (e.g., `idx = r * 3 + c`).
    - Select the predefined_pattern corresponding to `idx`.
    - Create the output_grid.
    - Iterate through the selected 9x9 predefined_pattern.
    - If a cell in the pattern is 1, place color C in the corresponding cell of the output_grid.
    - If a cell in the pattern is 0, place white (0) in the corresponding cell of the output_grid.
