**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing exactly one non-white pixel. The remaining 8 pixels are white (0).
2.  **Output:** A 9x9 grid. The colors used in the output grid are white (0) and the specific non-white color found in the input grid.
3.  **Relationship:** The output grid's pattern is determined *entirely* by the *position* of the non-white pixel in the input grid. The *color* of the non-white pixel in the input determines the foreground color used to draw that pattern in the output.
4.  **Transformation:** The 3x3 input acts as a selector. There are 9 possible input configurations (one non-white pixel in one of the 9 positions). Each configuration maps to a unique, predefined 9x9 binary pattern. The transformation involves identifying the input configuration (which pattern to use) and the input color (what color to draw the pattern with), and then rendering the selected 9x9 pattern using the specified color against a white background.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
input_grid:
  description: A 3x3 grid.
  properties:
    size: 3x3
    content: Contains exactly one non-white pixel and eight white (0) pixels.
    role: Selector and color source.
non_white_pixel:
  description: The single pixel in the input grid that is not white (0).
  properties:
    color: C (variable, determined from input)
    location: (r, c) within the 3x3 grid (variable, determined from input)
    role: Determines the output pattern and foreground color.
output_grid:
  description: A 9x9 grid representing the transformed input.
  properties:
    size: 9x9
    content: Composed of white (0) pixels and pixels of color C.
    structure: A specific pattern determined by the location (r, c) of the non_white_pixel in the input grid.
predefined_patterns:
  description: A set of 9 distinct, fixed 9x9 binary (0/1) patterns.
  properties:
    count: 9
    indexing: Each pattern corresponds to one of the 9 possible locations (r, c) of the non_white_pixel in the input grid.
    role: Templates for the output grid structure.
transformation:
  description: Maps the input configuration to the output grid.
  steps:
    - Identify color C and location (r, c) of the non_white_pixel in the input_grid.
    - Calculate an index `idx` based on (r, c) (e.g., `idx = r * 3 + c`).
    - Select the predefined_pattern corresponding to `idx`.
    - Create the output_grid.
    - Iterate through the selected 9x9 predefined_pattern.
    - If a cell in the pattern is 1, place color C in the corresponding cell of the output_grid.
    - If a cell in the pattern is 0, place white (0) in the corresponding cell of the output_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the 3x3 input grid to find the single non-white pixel.
2.  Store the color (`C`) and the row (`r`) and column (`c`) coordinates of this non-white pixel.
3.  Determine which of the 9 possible input configurations this corresponds to, based on the location (`r`, `c`). Assign a unique index (from 0 to 8) to this configuration (e.g., using the formula `index = r * 3 + c`).
4.  Retrieve the predefined 9x9 binary pattern associated with the calculated `index`.
5.  Create a new 9x9 grid, initially filled with white (0).
6.  Iterate through each cell `(R, C)` of the retrieved 9x9 binary pattern (where `R` is the row from 0-8, `C` is the column from 0-8).
7.  If the value of the pattern cell `pattern[R][C]` is 1, set the corresponding cell in the output grid `output[R][C]` to the color `C`.
8.  If the value of the pattern cell is 0, ensure the corresponding cell in the output grid `output[R][C]` remains white (0).
9.  Return the completed 9x9 output grid.
