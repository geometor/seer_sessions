The colors used in the output grid are white (0) and the specific non-white color found in the input grid.\n3.  **Relationship:** The output grid's pattern is determined *entirely* by the *position* of the non-white pixel in the input grid. The *color* of the non-white pixel in the input determines the foreground color used to draw that pattern in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The 3x3 input acts as a selector. There are 9 possible input configurations (one non-white pixel in one of the 9 positions). Each configuration maps to a unique, predefined 9x9 binary pattern. The transformation involves identifying the input configuration (which pattern to use) and the input color (what color to draw the pattern with), and then rendering the selected 9x9 pattern using the specified color against a white background.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
