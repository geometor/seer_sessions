            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 4x4. The output grids are consistently 8x8. This suggests the output is constructed by arranging multiple blocks, each related to the input, and the output dimensions are double the input dimensions.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The 8x8 output grid can be visually divided into four 4x4 quadrants.\n3.  **Quadrant Analysis:**\n    *   **Top-Left Quadrant:** In every example, this quadrant is an exact copy of the input grid.\n    *   **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant appears to be a transformation of the input. Comparing `train_1`, the transformation seems to be a transpose followed by a vertical flip. Let's verify:\n        *   Input: `[[4,1,9,1],[1,9,1,4],[9,1,4,6],[4,1,6,6]]`\n        *   Transpose: `[[4,1,9,4],[1,9,1,1],[9,1,4,6],[1,4,6,6]]`\n        *   Vertical Flip: `[[1,4,6,6],[9,1,4,6],[1,9,1,1],[4,1,9,4]]`. This matches the top-right quadrant in `train_1`.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant also seems to be a transformation. Comparing `train_1`, it looks like a 180-degree rotation of the input.\n        *   Input: `[[4,1,9,1],[1,9,1,4],[9,1,4,6],[4,1,6,6]]`\n        *   Rotate 180: `[[6,6,1,4],[6,4,1,9],[4,1,9,1],[1,9,1,4]]`. This matches the bottom-left quadrant in `train_1`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is another transformation. Comparing `train_1`, it looks like a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input.\n        *   Input: `[[4,1,9,1],[1,9,1,4],[9,1,4,6],[4,1,6,6]]`\n        *   Rotate 90 CW: `[[4,9,1,4],[1,1,9,1],[6,4,1,9],[6,6,4,1]]`. This matches the bottom-right quadrant in `train_1`.\n4.  **Consistency:** This pattern of transformations (Identity, Transpose+FlipUD, Rotate180, Rotate90CW) holds true for all provided training examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
