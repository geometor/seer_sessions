task_description: Construct a larger grid by arranging four transformed versions of the input grid in a 2x2 layout.
grid_properties:
  - input_grid: A square grid of size N x N. (In examples, N=4)
  - output_grid: A square grid of size 2N x 2N. (In examples, 8x8)
  - output_structure: Composed of four N x N subgrids (quadrants).

transformations:
  - name: Identity
    description: No change to the input grid.
    placement: Top-Left Quadrant (output[0:N, 0:N])
  - name: Transpose_FlipUD
    description: Transpose the input grid (swap rows and columns), then flip the result vertically (upside-down).
    placement: Top-Right Quadrant (output[0:N, N:2N])
  - name: Rotate_180
    description: Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees.
    placement: Bottom-Left Quadrant (output[N:2N, 0:N])
  - name: Rotate_90_CW
    description: Rotate the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise.
    placement: Bottom-Right Quadrant (output[N:2N, N:2N])

relationships:
  - The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.
  - Each quadrant of the output grid is derived solely from the input grid using a specific geometric transformation.
