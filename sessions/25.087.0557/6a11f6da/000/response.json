            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 15 rows by 5 columns. The output grids are 5 rows by 5 columns.\n2.  **Input Structure:** The 15x5 input grid appears to be composed of three distinct 5x5 subgrids (layers) stacked vertically.\n    *   Layer 1 (Top): Rows 0-4. Contains pixels of White (0) and Blue (1).\n    *   Layer 2 (Middle): Rows 5-9. Contains pixels of White (0) and Azure (8).\n    *   Layer 3 (Bottom): Rows 10-14. Contains pixels of White (0) and Magenta (6).\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output is a single 5x5 grid.\n4.  **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be formed by combining the three input layers based on the colors present at corresponding pixel locations `(r, c)`.\n5.  **Color Interaction:** For each position `(r, c)` (where `r` and `c` range from 0 to 4), the output color `output[r][c]` depends on the colors at `input[r][c]`, `input[r+5][c]`, and `input[r+10][c]`.\n6.  **Priority Rules:**\n    *   If only one of the three corresponding input pixels is non-white (i.e., not 0), the output pixel takes that color.\n    *   If multiple input pixels are non-white, a priority system determines the output color.\n    *   Observing the examples reveals a general priority: Blue (1) seems to have the highest priority, followed by Magenta (6), then Azure (8). `1 > 6 > 8`.\n    *   However, there's a special case: when all three colors (Blue=1, Azure=8, Magenta=6) are present at the corresponding positions in the three layers, the output pixel becomes Magenta (6), overriding the general priority.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
