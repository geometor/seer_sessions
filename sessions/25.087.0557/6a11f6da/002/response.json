            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code attempted to solve the task by treating the 15x5 input grid as three stacked 5x5 layers and applying pixel-wise color priority rules. The code failed on all five training examples, indicating that the initial hypothesis about the priority rules, derived solely from the first example, was incorrect or incomplete.\n\nThe errors consistently involve specific combinations of colors from the input layers leading to the wrong output color. Specifically, the code incorrectly prioritized Blue (Layer 1) over Magenta (Layer 3) in certain situations. The strategy is to analyze the exact pixel values (input layers, expected output, actual output) for the failing pixels across all examples to deduce the correct priority rules.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis of Errors**\n\nThe previous code failed when the pixel values from the three layers `(p1, p2, p3)` corresponding to `input[r, c]`, `input[r+5, c]`, `input[r+10, c]` were `(1, 0, 6)` (Blue, White, Magenta).\n\n*   **Previous Logic for (1, 0, 6):**\n    1.  Rule 1 (`p1=1` and `p2=8` and `p3=6`) -> False\n    2.  Rule 2 (`p1=1`) -> True. Output: `1` (Blue).\n*   **Expected Output for (1, 0, 6):** The expected output was consistently `6` (Magenta) in all instances where the code failed.\n\nHere's a summary of the failing pixels across examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** 4 pixels failed. All had input `(1, 0, 6)`, expected `6`, got `1`.\n*   **Example 2:** 3 pixels failed. All had input `(1, 0, 6)`, expected `6`, got `1`.\n*   **Example 3:** 1 pixel failed. Input `(1, 0, 6)`, expected `6`, got `1`.\n*   **Example 4:** 4 pixels failed. All had input `(1, 0, 6)`, expected `6`, got `1`.\n*   **Example 5:** 5 pixels failed. All had input `(1, 0, 6)`, expected `6`, got `1`.\n\nThis analysis strongly suggests that the priority needs adjustment: when Layer 1 has Blue (1) and Layer 3 has Magenta (6), the output should be Magenta (6), overriding the general priority of Blue (Layer 1).\n\n**YAML Block: Documenting Facts**\n\n"
