The metrics confirm:
- Input and output grids always have the same shape.
- There is always a single gray pixel (color 5) in the input, which acts as the pivot.
- The pivot pixel's coordinates remain unchanged in the output.
- The background color is white (color 0).
- All non-background colors present in the input are also present in the output, and their counts are identical. This confirms no pixels are lost or added, and no colors are changed. Pixels might be rotated out of bounds, but this doesn't seem to happen in the examples.
- The failed `transformed_output` from the previous code sometimes has different color counts (e.g., Example 3 lost the Red pixel), which implies the rotation logic or bounds checking was flawed *even for the incorrect rotation*. It seems the previous code rotated Red (2) at (4,0) (rel(2,-3)) using 90deg clockwise to (-3,-2) -> Abs(0,2). This is within bounds for Ex3 (9x9). Why was it lost? Let's recheck the code. Ah, the code puts it at (0,2). Let's recheck the transformed output colors for Ex3: `[0, 1, 3, 5]`. Red (2) *is* missing! Why? `output_np[0, 2] = color` should have worked. Perhaps another pixel overwrote it? Let's see what else lands at (0,2). Blue(1) at (5,1) -> rel(2,-3) -> CCW(-(-3), 2) = (3,2) -> Abs(3+3, 4+2) = (6,6). Wait, I was checking the previous *code's* logic (90 deg CW). Blue(1) at (5,1) -> rel(2,-3) -> CW(-3,-2) -> Abs(3-3, 4-2) = (0,2). Yes! The Blue pixel overwrites the Red pixel's intended position in the faulty 90-degree clockwise rotation. This explains the color count discrepancy in the previous failed attempt for Example 3.

The core finding remains: the transformation is a 180-degree rotation around the gray pivot.

The provided code attempted to implement a 90-degree clockwise rotation around a gray pivot pixel. However, comparing the code's output (`Transformed Output`) with the `Expected Output` for the training examples reveals that the implemented rotation does not match the task's requirements. My analysis indicates that the transformation is actually a **180-degree rotation** around the gray pivot pixel, not a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The previous code correctly identified the pivot and iterated through pixels but applied the wrong rotation transformation. The metrics confirm that grid size, pivot position, and non-background pixel counts remain constant, supporting a rotational transformation where pixels are mapped to new positions within the grid.

## Metrics Analysis

The `code_execution` block provided the following key metrics derived from the examples:

| Metric                      | Example 1       | Example 2       | Example 3       | Observation                                     |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Input Shape                 | (7, 9)          | (3, 3)          | (9, 9)          | Variable grid sizes                             |
| Output Shape                | (7, 9)          | (3, 3)          | (9, 9)          | Output shape matches input shape                |
| Pivot Coords (Input)        | (3, 4)          | (1, 1)          | (2, 3)          | Unique gray (5) pixel exists in input         |
| Pivot Coords (Output)       | (3, 4)          | (1, 1)          | (2, 3)          | Pivot position is invariant                     |
| Input Non-BG Colors         | {1:1, 2:1, 3:3, 4:1, 5:1} | {1:1, 2:2, 5:1, 6:1} | {1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 5:1} | Various colors involved                         |
| Output Non-BG Colors        | {1:1, 2:1, 3:3, 4:1, 5:1} | {1:1, 2:2, 5:1, 6:1} | {1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 5:1} | Color counts match between input and output |
| Background Color            | 0 (White)       | 0 (White)       | 0 (White)       | Consistent background color                     |
| Transformation Discrepancy | Failed (90° CW) | Failed (90° CW) | Failed (90° CW) | Original code applied incorrect rotation angle |

This analysis strongly supports the hypothesis of a 180-degree rotation, as it preserves the grid size, pivot location, and the multiset of non-background colors.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize**: Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filling it entirely with the background color (white, 0).
2.  **Find Pivot**: Locate the coordinates (center_row, center_col) of the single gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid.
3.  **Iterate and Rotate**: Go through each pixel in the input grid at position (input_row, input_col).
4.  **Check Pixel**: If the current pixel's color is not the background color (white, 0):
    a.  **Calculate Relative Position**: Determine the pixel's position relative to the pivot: `relative_row = input_row - center_row`, `relative_col = input_col - center_col`.
    b.  **Apply 180-Degree Rotation**: Calculate the new relative position after a 180-degree rotation: `new_relative_row = -relative_row`, `new_relative_col = -relative_col`.
    c.  **Calculate New Absolute Position**: Find the pixel's new absolute position in the output grid: `output_row = center_row + new_relative_row`, `output_col = center_col + new_relative_col`.
    d.  **Place Pixel**: Check if the calculated (`output_row`, `output_col`) is within the bounds of the grid. If it is, set the color of the pixel at (`output_row`, `output_col`) in the output grid to the color of the original input pixel.
5.  **Return**: The completed output grid is the result of the transformation.
