            "text": "The metrics confirm:\n- Input and output grids always have the same shape.\n- There is always a single gray pixel (color 5) in the input, which acts as the pivot.\n- The pivot pixel's coordinates remain unchanged in the output.\n- The background color is white (color 0).\n- All non-background colors present in the input are also present in the output, and their counts are identical. This confirms no pixels are lost or added, and no colors are changed. Pixels might be rotated out of bounds, but this doesn't seem to happen in the examples.\n- The failed `transformed_output` from the previous code sometimes has different color counts (e.g., Example 3 lost the Red pixel), which implies the rotation logic or bounds checking was flawed *even for the incorrect rotation*. It seems the previous code rotated Red (2) at (4,0) (rel(2,-3)) using 90deg clockwise to (-3,-2) -> Abs(0,2). This is within bounds for Ex3 (9x9). Why was it lost? Let's recheck the code. Ah, the code puts it at (0,2). Let's recheck the transformed output colors for Ex3: `[0, 1, 3, 5]`. Red (2) *is* missing! Why? `output_np[0, 2] = color` should have worked. Perhaps another pixel overwrote it? Let's see what else lands at (0,2). Blue(1) at (5,1) -> rel(2,-3) -> CCW(-(-3), 2) = (3,2) -> Abs(3+3, 4+2) = (6,6). Wait, I was checking the previous *code's* logic (90 deg CW). Blue(1) at (5,1) -> rel(2,-3) -> CW(-3,-2) -> Abs(3-3, 4-2) = (0,2). Yes! The Blue pixel overwrites the Red pixel's intended position in the faulty 90-degree clockwise rotation. This explains the color count discrepancy in the previous failed attempt for Example 3.\n\nThe core finding remains: the transformation is a 180-degree rotation around the gray pivot.\n\nYAML Facts generation:\nFocus on objects, properties, actions.\n- Objects: Pixels, Grid\n- Properties: Color, Position (row, col), Pivot status (is gray pixel?), Background status (is white pixel?)\n- Action: Rotate 180 degrees around the pivot.\n\nNL Program generation:\nRefine based on the 180-degree rotation discovery. Ensure clarity and cover all steps.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempted to implement a 90-degree clockwise rotation around a gray pivot pixel. However, comparing the code's output (`Transformed Output`) with the `Expected Output` for the training examples reveals that the implemented rotation does not match the task's requirements. My analysis indicates that the transformation is actually a **180-degree rotation** around the gray pivot pixel, not a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The previous code correctly identified the pivot and iterated through pixels but applied the wrong rotation transformation. The metrics confirm that grid size, pivot position, and non-background pixel counts remain constant, supporting a rotational transformation where pixels are mapped to new positions within the grid.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nThe `code_execution` block provided the following key metrics derived from the examples:\n\n| Metric                      | Example 1       | Example 2       | Example 3       | Observation                                     |\n| :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |\n| Input Shape                 | (7, 9)          | (3, 3)          | (9, 9)          | Variable grid sizes                             |\n| Output Shape                | (7, 9)          | (3, 3)          | (9, 9)          | Output shape matches input shape                |\n| Pivot Coords (Input)        | (3, 4)          | (1, 1)          | (2, 3)          | Unique gray (5) pixel exists in input         |\n| Pivot Coords (Output)       | (3, 4)          | (1, 1)          | (2, 3)          | Pivot position is invariant                     |\n| Input Non-BG Colors         | {1:1, 2:1, 3:3, 4:1, 5:1} | {1:1, 2:2, 5:1, 6:1} | {1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 5:1} | Various colors involved                         |\n| Output Non-BG Colors        | {1:1, 2:1, 3:3, 4:1, 5:1} | {1:1, 2:2, 5:1, 6:1} | {1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 5:1} | Color counts match between input and output |\n| Background Color            | 0 (White)       | 0 (White)       | 0 (White)       | Consistent background color                     |\n| Transformation Discrepancy | Failed (90\u00b0 CW) | Failed (90\u00b0 CW) | Failed (90\u00b0 CW) | Original code applied incorrect rotation angle |\n\nThis analysis strongly supports the hypothesis of a 180-degree rotation, as it preserves the grid size, pivot location, and the multiset of non-background colors.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
