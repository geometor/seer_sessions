"""
The transformation identifies three horizontal line segments in the input grid: 
1. A red line (color 2).
2. A non-red, non-white 'top line' located above the red line.
3. A non-red, non-white 'bottom line' located below the red line.

It then determines the horizontal intersection (common columns) between the top and bottom lines. 

Finally, it fills a rectangular area with yellow (color 4). The columns of this rectangle are defined by the intersection found earlier. The rows depend on the relative widths of the top and bottom lines:
- If the bottom line is strictly narrower than the top line, the yellow rectangle fills the rows strictly between the top line and the red line.
- Otherwise (if the top line is narrower than or equal in width to the bottom line), the yellow rectangle fills the rows strictly between the red line and the bottom line.

The original lines and background are preserved in the output.
