The rest of the grid is typically white (color 0).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid preserves the original red, top, and bottom lines and the white background. The only change is the addition of a rectangular area filled with yellow pixels (color 4).\n3.  **Transformation:** The key is determining the location and dimensions of the yellow rectangle.\n    *   **Columns:** The columns occupied by the yellow rectangle are precisely those columns where the top line and the bottom line overlap horizontally (their intersection).\n    *   **Rows:** The rows occupied by the yellow rectangle depend on a comparison of the widths (number of columns) of the top and bottom lines:\n        *   If the bottom line is strictly narrower than the top line, the yellow rectangle fills the rows strictly *between* the top line and the red line.\n        *   Otherwise (if the top line is narrower than or equal in width to the bottom line), the yellow rectangle fills the rows strictly *between* the red line and the bottom line.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
