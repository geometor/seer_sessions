Odd-numbered rows and columns (1, 3, 5) consist entirely of white pixels (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves selecting specific pixels from the input grid to form the output grid. The output grid seems to be a downsampled version of the input grid.\n4.  **Mapping:** Comparing the input and output grids reveals a consistent mapping: the pixel at position (r, c) in the 3x3 output grid corresponds to the pixel at position (2*r, 2*c) in the 6x6 input grid.\n5.  **Color Preservation:** The colors of the selected pixels are preserved exactly from the input to the output. White pixels (0) are also copied if they are at the sampled locations.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
