task_type: grid_transformation
input_grid:
  size: 6x6
  properties:
    - Contains various colors (0-9).
    - White pixels (0) act as background.
    - Non-white pixels are primarily located at coordinates (row, col) where both row and col are even numbers (0, 2, 4).
    - Odd-numbered rows and columns are entirely white (0).
output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  properties:
    - Contains colors sampled from the input grid.
transformation:
  type: sampling
  description: Selects pixels from the input grid based on their coordinates.
mapping_rule:
  input_coord: (row_in, col_in)
  output_coord: (row_out, col_out)
  relationship: row_in = row_out * 2, col_in = col_out * 2
color_handling: Colors are preserved during sampling.
