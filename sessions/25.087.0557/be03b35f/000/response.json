            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 5x5, and the output grids are consistently 2x2.\n2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n3.  **Key Feature:** Each input grid features a distinct 2x2 block composed entirely of red (2) pixels. This block appears consistently in the bottom-right corner (rows 3-4, columns 3-4).\n4.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The size of the output grid (2x2) matches the size of the red block in the input. This suggests the red block plays a role in defining the structure or focus area for the transformation.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Observing the pixel values:\n    *   In `train_1`, the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input is `[[1, 1], [1, 0]]`. The output is `[[1, 0], [1, 1]]`.\n    *   In `train_2`, the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input is `[[1, 0], [1, 1]]`. The output is `[[0, 1], [1, 1]]`.\n    *   In `train_3`, the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input is `[[1, 1], [0, 0]]`. The output is `[[1, 0], [1, 0]]`.\n    The relationship between the input's top-left 2x2 subgrid and the output grid appears to be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The red block seems to indicate *which* diagonally opposite 2x2 region to extract and rotate.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
