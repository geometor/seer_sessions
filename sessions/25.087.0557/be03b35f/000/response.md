Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 5x5, and the output grids are consistently 2x2.
2.  **Colors:** The input grids contain white (0), blue (1), and red (2) pixels. The output grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Key Feature:** Each input grid features a distinct 2x2 block composed entirely of red (2) pixels. This block appears consistently in the bottom-right corner (rows 3-4, columns 3-4).
4.  **Input-Output Relationship:** The size of the output grid (2x2) matches the size of the red block in the input. This suggests the red block plays a role in defining the structure or focus area for the transformation.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** Observing the pixel values:
    *   In `train_1`, the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input is `[[1, 1], [1, 0]]`. The output is `[[1, 0], [1, 1]]`.
    *   In `train_2`, the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input is `[[1, 0], [1, 1]]`. The output is `[[0, 1], [1, 1]]`.
    *   In `train_3`, the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input is `[[1, 1], [0, 0]]`. The output is `[[1, 0], [1, 0]]`.
    The relationship between the input's top-left 2x2 subgrid and the output grid appears to be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The red block seems to indicate *which* diagonally opposite 2x2 region to extract and rotate.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input Grid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 5
    - Width: 5
    - Colors: [white (0), blue (1), red (2)]
  Objects:
    - Type: Block
      Color: red (2)
      Shape: Square (2x2)
      Location: Bottom-right corner (rows 3-4, cols 3-4)
    - Type: Pixels
      Color: blue (1)
      Location: Various, scattered
    - Type: Pixels
      Color: white (0)
      Location: Various, background

Output Grid:
  Properties:
    - Height: 2
    - Width: 2
    - Colors: [white (0), blue (1)]

Transformation:
  Focus: The 2x2 subgrid diagonally opposite the red block.
  Action: Rotate this subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
  Source Region: Top-left 2x2 subgrid (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) in the input.
  Result: The rotated subgrid becomes the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the 2x2 subgrid in the input grid that is diagonally opposite the 2x2 block of red pixels. (Since the red block is in the bottom-right corner of the 5x5 grid, the target subgrid is the 2x2 region in the top-left corner, specifically at rows 0-1 and columns 0-1).
2.  Extract this 2x2 subgrid from the input.
3.  Rotate the extracted 2x2 subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
4.  The resulting 2x2 grid is the final output.
