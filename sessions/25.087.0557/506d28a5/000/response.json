            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids consistently feature a horizontal line composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4). This line divides the input grid into two distinct sections: a top section and a bottom section.\n2.  **Color Distribution (Input):**\n    *   The top section contains only red (2) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   The bottom section contains only blue (1) and white (0) pixels.\n    *   The yellow line (4) acts solely as a separator.\n3.  **Output Structure:** The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of either the top or bottom section of the input grid (excluding the separator line).\n4.  **Color Distribution (Output):** The output grids contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation appears to involve comparing the pixels in the top section with the pixels in the corresponding positions in the bottom section.\n    *   Observing the examples, a green pixel (3) appears in the output grid if *either* the corresponding pixel in the top section is red (2) *or* the corresponding pixel in the bottom section is blue (1).\n    *   If both the corresponding top pixel and bottom pixel are white (0), the output pixel is also white (0).\n6.  **Object Identification:** We can consider the top section, bottom section, and separator line as distinct components of the input. The transformation operates by combining information from the top and bottom sections based on specific color conditions.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
