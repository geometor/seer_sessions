Task: Modify grid based on pixel color and horizontal contiguity.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: height x width (variable, consistent between input/output)
    - pixels: Cells with colors (0-9)

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: Same as input grid
    - pixels: Derived from input grid pixels

Elements:
  - Pixel:
      Properties:
        - color: Integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
        - position: (row, column)
  - Horizontal Segment:
      Properties:
        - color: A single non-white color (1-9)
        - pixels: A contiguous sequence of pixels in the same row with the same non-white color.
        - boundaries: Defined by adjacent pixels of a different color (or grid edges).
        - rightmost_pixel: The pixel in the segment with the largest column index.

Transformations:
  - Action: Color Replacement (Background)
      Input: Pixels with color white (0)
      Output: Pixels with color gray (5)
      Condition: Applies to all white pixels.
  - Action: Color Replacement (Segment End)
      Input: The rightmost pixel of a horizontal segment.
      Output: Pixel with color gray (5).
      Condition: Applies only if the segment's color is NOT green (3).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels next to each other horizontally define segments.
  - Color Matching: The transformation logic depends specifically on whether a pixel/segment color is white (0) or green (3).
