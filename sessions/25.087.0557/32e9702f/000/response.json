These segments remain entirely unchanged in the output (except for the background around them changing from white to gray). This suggests that green segments are treated differently from segments of other non-white colors.\n7.  **Rule Synthesis:** Combining these observations, the rule seems to be:\n    *   Replace all white (0) pixels with gray (5).\n    *   Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in each row.\n    *   If a segment's color is *not* green (3), change the color of the rightmost pixel of that segment to gray (5).\n    *   If a segment's color *is* green (3), leave the segment unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
