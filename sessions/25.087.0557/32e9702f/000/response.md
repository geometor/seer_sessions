Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Background Color:** The most prominent change is that all white pixels (color 0) in the input are replaced with gray pixels (color 5) in the output.
3.  **Object Preservation/Modification:** Non-white pixels in the input generally seem to correspond to non-white pixels in the output, but there are specific modifications.
4.  **Horizontal Segments:** The transformation appears to operate on contiguous horizontal segments of non-white colors within each row.
5.  **Rightmost Pixel Change:** In examples 1 and 3, the rightmost pixel of each horizontal segment of non-white color (yellow - 4, orange - 7) is changed to gray (5).
6.  **Color Exception:** In example 2, the horizontal segments consist of green pixels (color 3). These segments remain entirely unchanged in the output (except for the background around them changing from white to gray). This suggests that green segments are treated differently from segments of other non-white colors.
7.  **Rule Synthesis:** Combining these observations, the rule seems to be:
    *   Replace all white (0) pixels with gray (5).
    *   Identify all contiguous horizontal segments of non-white pixels in each row.
    *   If a segment's color is *not* green (3), change the color of the rightmost pixel of that segment to gray (5).
    *   If a segment's color *is* green (3), leave the segment unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Modify grid based on pixel color and horizontal contiguity.

Input_Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: height x width (variable, consistent between input/output)
    - pixels: Cells with colors (0-9)

Output_Grid:
  Properties:
    - dimensions: Same as input grid
    - pixels: Derived from input grid pixels

Elements:
  - Pixel:
      Properties:
        - color: Integer 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon)
        - position: (row, column)
  - Horizontal Segment:
      Properties:
        - color: A single non-white color (1-9)
        - pixels: A contiguous sequence of pixels in the same row with the same non-white color.
        - boundaries: Defined by adjacent pixels of a different color (or grid edges).
        - rightmost_pixel: The pixel in the segment with the largest column index.

Transformations:
  - Action: Color Replacement (Background)
      Input: Pixels with color white (0)
      Output: Pixels with color gray (5)
      Condition: Applies to all white pixels.
  - Action: Color Replacement (Segment End)
      Input: The rightmost pixel of a horizontal segment.
      Output: Pixel with color gray (5).
      Condition: Applies only if the segment's color is NOT green (3).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels next to each other horizontally define segments.
  - Color Matching: The transformation logic depends specifically on whether a pixel/segment color is white (0) or green (3).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new grid (the "output grid") with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid at position (row, column).
3.  If the input pixel's color is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).
4.  If the input pixel's color is *not* white (0), copy its color to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
5.  After initializing the output grid, iterate through each row of the input grid.
6.  For each row, identify all contiguous horizontal segments of pixels whose color is *not* white (0) and *not* green (3).
7.  For each such identified segment, find the column index (`c_end`) of its rightmost pixel.
8.  Set the color of the pixel at position (row, `c_end`) in the *output grid* to gray (5).
9.  Leave all horizontal segments of green (3) pixels unchanged from their initial copied state in the output grid.
10. The final state of the output grid is the result.
