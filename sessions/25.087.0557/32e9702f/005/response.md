"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:
1. Create an output grid by copying the input grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the input grid to find contiguous horizontal segments of non-white (0) pixels.
3. For each segment found:
    a. If the segment's color is *not* green (3), change the rightmost pixel of that segment in the *output grid* to gray (5).
    b. If the segment's color *is* green (3), leave the segment unchanged in the output grid.
4. After processing all segments, iterate through the grid positions. If a pixel was originally white (0) in the *input grid*, change the corresponding pixel in the *output grid* to gray (5).
5. Return the modified output grid.
