task_description: Analyze horizontal segments of non-white pixels and modify the output based on the segment's color and position.
grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width in all examples.
  - background_color: Input background is white (0).
  - output_background_color: Output background is consistently gray (5), replacing all original white pixels.
objects:
  - type: horizontal_segment
    definition: A contiguous sequence of one or more pixels of the same color within a single row.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the segment.
      - location: Defined by row index, start column index, and end column index.
      - length: Number of pixels in the segment.
actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: input_grid
    output: list_of_segments
    filter: Only consider segments whose color is not white (0).
  - name: transform_segment
    input: segment_info, output_grid_copy
    condition: Based on segment color.
    outcomes:
      - if color == green (3):
          action: Copy the segment pixels from input to the corresponding positions in the output grid without modification.
      - if color != green (3) and color != white (0):
          action: Copy the segment pixels from input to the output grid, *except* change the color of the rightmost pixel (highest column index) to gray (5).
  - name: transform_background
    input: input_grid, output_grid
    action: Iterate through the output grid. If the corresponding pixel in the input grid was white (0), set the output grid pixel to gray (5). This action should be performed after segment transformations to avoid overwriting parts of preserved segments.
