Creates an output grid initialized as a copy of the input grid.\n2. Iterates through each pixel of the input grid.\n3. For each pixel:\n   - If the pixel is blue (1), checks its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).\n     If any neighbor is azure (8), the corresponding pixel in the output grid is set to red (2).\n   - If the pixel is azure (8), checks its 8 neighbors.\n     If any neighbor is blue (1), the corresponding pixel in the output grid is set to red (2).\n   - Otherwise (if the pixel is not blue (1) or azure (8), or if the conditions above are not met),\n     the pixel in the output grid retains its original color from the input grid copy.\n4.
