elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0-9, with specific focus on blue (1), azure (8), red (2), and white (0).
      - position: Coordinates (row, column) within the grid.
      - neighbors: Set of adjacent pixels (8 neighbors: horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner.
    applies_to: [pixel, pixel]
action:
  - name: change_color
    conditions:
      - "The pixel's color is blue (1) AND at least one adjacent pixel's color is azure (8)."
      - "OR"
      - "The pixel's color is azure (8) AND at least one adjacent pixel's color is blue (1)."
    results:
      - "The pixel's color becomes red (2)."
  - name: retain_color
    conditions:
      - "The conditions for change_color are not met."
    results:
      - "The pixel's color remains unchanged."
goal:
  - description: Create an output grid where pixels that are blue (1) and adjacent to azure (8), or azure (8) and adjacent to blue (1), are changed to red (2), while all other pixels keep their original color.
