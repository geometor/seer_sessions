            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the examples provided for this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of varying dimensions.\n2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), red (2), azure (8), and white (0). White seems to act as a background or separator.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The central change appears to involve blue (1) and azure (8) pixels transforming into red (2) pixels under specific conditions. Other pixels (white - 0) remain unchanged.\n4.  **Condition for Change:** Examining the examples, a blue (1) pixel changes to red (2) only when it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one azure (8) pixel. Similarly, an azure (8) pixel changes to red (2) only when it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one blue (1) pixel.\n5.  **No Change Condition:** If a blue (1) pixel has no adjacent azure (8) pixels, it remains blue (1). If an azure (8) pixel has no adjacent blue (1) pixels, it remains azure (8).\n6.  **Interaction:** The transformation seems to be a result of the interaction or \"touching\" (adjacency) between blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. When they touch, both interacting pixels turn red (2).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
