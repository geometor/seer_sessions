Okay, let's analyze the examples provided for this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of varying dimensions.
2.  **Colors Involved:** The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1), red (2), azure (8), and white (0). White seems to act as a background or separator.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The central change appears to involve blue (1) and azure (8) pixels transforming into red (2) pixels under specific conditions. Other pixels (white - 0) remain unchanged.
4.  **Condition for Change:** Examining the examples, a blue (1) pixel changes to red (2) only when it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one azure (8) pixel. Similarly, an azure (8) pixel changes to red (2) only when it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one blue (1) pixel.
5.  **No Change Condition:** If a blue (1) pixel has no adjacent azure (8) pixels, it remains blue (1). If an azure (8) pixel has no adjacent blue (1) pixels, it remains azure (8).
6.  **Interaction:** The transformation seems to be a result of the interaction or "touching" (adjacency) between blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. When they touch, both interacting pixels turn red (2).

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: An integer from 0-9, with specific focus on blue (1), azure (8), red (2), and white (0).
      - position: Coordinates (row, column) within the grid.
      - neighbors: Set of adjacent pixels (8 neighbors: horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
relationship:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner.
    applies_to: [pixel, pixel]
action:
  - name: change_color
    conditions:
      - "The pixel's color is blue (1) AND at least one adjacent pixel's color is azure (8)."
      - "OR"
      - "The pixel's color is azure (8) AND at least one adjacent pixel's color is blue (1)."
    results:
      - "The pixel's color becomes red (2)."
  - name: retain_color
    conditions:
      - "The conditions for change_color are not met."
    results:
      - "The pixel's color remains unchanged."
goal:
  - description: Create an output grid where pixels that are blue (1) and adjacent to azure (8), or azure (8) and adjacent to blue (1), are changed to red (2), while all other pixels keep their original color.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  For the current pixel, check its color.
4.  If the pixel's color is blue (1):
    *   Examine all its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    *   If any neighbor's color is azure (8), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).
    *   If none of the neighbors are azure (8), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to blue (1) (i.e., keep it unchanged).
5.  If the pixel's color is azure (8):
    *   Examine all its adjacent neighbors.
    *   If any neighbor's color is blue (1), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to red (2).
    *   If none of the neighbors are blue (1), set the color of the corresponding pixel in the output grid to azure (8) (i.e., keep it unchanged).
6.  If the pixel's color is neither blue (1) nor azure (8), copy its color directly to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
7.  After iterating through all pixels, the output grid contains the final result.
