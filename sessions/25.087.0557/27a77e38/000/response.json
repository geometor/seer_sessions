This line seems to act as a separator or a reference marker.\n3.  **Area Above Gray Line:** Contains various colored pixels.\n4.  **Area Below Gray Line:** Initially consists of only white (0) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves changing the color of a single white pixel in the bottom-most row of the grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n6.  **Location of Change:** The pixel that changes is always in the bottom row and located in the same column as the *center* of the horizontal gray line.\n7.  **Color Source:** The new color assigned to the bottom-row pixel is taken from the pixel in the *top-most row* (row 0) that is in the *same column* as the center of the gray line.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
