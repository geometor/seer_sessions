facts:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9. Contains other objects.
  - object: gray_line
    description: A contiguous horizontal segment composed entirely of gray (5) pixels, potentially padded by white (0) pixels in its row.
    properties:
      - row_index: The row number where the line is located.
      - columns: A list of column indices covered by the gray pixels.
      - center_column: The floor of the average of the minimum and maximum column index of the gray pixels. (start_col + end_col) // 2.
  - object: source_reference_cell
    description: The cell located directly above the center of the gray line.
    properties:
      - coordinates: (gray_line.row_index - 1, gray_line.center_column)
  - object: source_color_determinants
    description: The horizontal neighbors of the source_reference_cell within the grid boundaries.
    properties:
      - left_neighbor: Cell at (source_reference_cell.row, source_reference_cell.col - 1), if valid.
      - right_neighbor: Cell at (source_reference_cell.row, source_reference_cell.col + 1), if valid.
  - object: source_color
    description: The color value to be copied. Determined by the source_color_determinants.
    derivation_rule:
      - If left_neighbor and right_neighbor exist and have the same color, use that color.
      - Else if left_neighbor exists, use its color.
      - Else if right_neighbor exists, use its color.
      - Else (if no neighbors exist, e.g., 1-column wide grid), use the color of the source_reference_cell itself.
  - object: target_cell
    description: The cell in the last row of the grid that will be modified.
    properties:
      - coordinates: (grid.height - 1, gray_line.center_column)
  - action: copy_color
    description: The color of the target_cell is changed to the source_color.
    actor: transformation process
    input: source_color
    output: modified grid where target_cell has source_color.
