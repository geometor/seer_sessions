**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** All examples have a 4x4 input grid and a 4x20 output grid. The height remains constant, while the width increases by a factor of 5 (4 * 5 = 20).
2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be constructed by tiling multiple copies or transformations of the input grid horizontally.
3.  **Transformation Identification:** Comparing the input grid with sequential 4x4 blocks within the output grid reveals a consistent pattern across all examples:
    *   The first 4x4 block of the output is identical to the input grid.
    *   The second 4x4 block of the output is a horizontal flip (mirror image) of the input grid.
    *   This pattern of [Original, Flipped] repeats.
    *   Since the output width is 5 times the input width, the full sequence of blocks is: [Original, Flipped, Original, Flipped, Original].

```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  - dimensionality: 2D
  - cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
input_grid:
  - name: original_grid
  - dimensions: variable height (H) and width (W) (observed H=4, W=4 in examples)
transformations:
  - operation: horizontal_flip
    input: original_grid
    output: flipped_grid
  - operation: horizontal_concatenation
    inputs:
      - original_grid
      - flipped_grid
    sequence: [original_grid, flipped_grid, original_grid, flipped_grid, original_grid] # 5 blocks total
    output: final_output_grid
output_grid:
  - name: final_output_grid
  - dimensions:
      height: H (same as input)
      width: 5 * W (5 times input width)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Create a horizontally flipped version of the input grid.
3.  Construct the output grid by concatenating horizontally, in order: the original input grid, the flipped grid, the original grid, the flipped grid, and finally the original grid. The resulting output grid will have the same height as the input grid and a width five times that of the input grid.
