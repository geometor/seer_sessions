**Revised Assessment:**

*   The count of azure pixels is always even (12 or 16) in all examples.
*   The simple parity rule (Odd -> Pattern 1, Even -> Pattern 2) does not work, as it predicts Pattern 2 for all examples, but the expected output alternates between Pattern 1 and Pattern 2.
*   The previous code used the rule: Odd -> PATTERN_A (Pattern 1), Even -> PATTERN_B (different from Pattern 2). This explains why it failed. It was using the wrong rule *and* one of the patterns was slightly incorrect.

**New Strategy:**

Since the total count/parity doesn't determine the output pattern, I need to find another property of the input grid that correlates with the choice between Pattern 1 and Pattern 2.

Let's look at the inputs again:
*   Input 1 (Count 12) -> Pattern 1
*   Input 2 (Count 16) -> Pattern 2
*   Input 3 (Count 12) -> Pattern 1
*   Input 4 (Count 16) -> Pattern 2
*   Input 5 (Count 12) -> Pattern 1

It seems like:
*   If the total count of azure pixels is 12, the output is Pattern 1.
*   If the total count of azure pixels is 16, the output is Pattern 2.

This hypothesis fits all 5 examples perfectly.

**Defining the Patterns:**

*   **Pattern 1:**
    
```
    [[0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
    ```

*   **Pattern 2:**
    
```
    [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
    ```


The input grid itself seems irrelevant beyond the total count of azure pixels. The transformation always produces one of these two fixed 5x5 grids.

Let's structure the findings.## General Assessment

The previous analysis correctly identified that the output is one of two fixed 5x5 patterns composed of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. However, the rule used to select between the two patterns (parity of the azure pixel count) was incorrect. Additionally, one of the defined output patterns (Pattern B) did not accurately match the expected output for the corresponding examples.

The provided results show that the previous code failed consistently, always being off by 2 pixels when the expected output was Pattern 1 (Examples 1, 3, 5) and also failing for Pattern 2 (Examples 2, 4), although the specific pixel differences varied because the expected Pattern 2 was different from the `PATTERN_B` used in the code.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correctly identify the two distinct 5x5 output patterns present in the examples.
2.  Re-analyze the input grids to find the correct property that determines which of the two output patterns is chosen.
3.  Update the natural language program with the corrected patterns and selection rule.

## Metrics

Let's re-examine the relationship between the input azure pixel count and the specific output pattern.

**Output Patterns:**

*   **Pattern 1:** (Observed in examples 1, 3, 5)
    
```
    [[0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
    ```

*   **Pattern 2:** (Observed in examples 2, 4)
    
```
    [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
     [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
    ```

- Example 2: Azure Count = 16 -> Pattern 2
- Example 3: Azure Count = 12 -> Pattern 1
- Example 4: Azure Count = 16 -> Pattern 2

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Determine which of two fixed 5x5 patterns to output based on the input grid.

Input Grid:
  - Size: 6x6
  - Colors: Primarily white (0) and azure (8). Other colors do not appear relevant.
  - Objects: Clusters of azure pixels on a white background. Their shape and position seem irrelevant.

Output Grid:
  - Size: 5x5
  - Content: Always one of two fixed patterns composed of white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - Pattern 1:
      [[0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
  - Pattern 2:
      [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]

Transformation Rule:
  - Action: Count the total number of azure (8) pixels in the 6x6 input grid.
  - Condition:
    - If the count of azure pixels is 12, the output is Pattern 1.
    - If the count of azure pixels is 16, the output is Pattern 2.
  - Note: The observed counts in the examples are only 12 and 16. The rule for other counts is unknown but likely follows this mapping if other counts are possible.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Define** two fixed 5x5 output grids, named `Pattern 1` and `Pattern 2`:
    *   `Pattern 1`:
        
```
        [[0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
         [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
         [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
        ```

    *   `Pattern 2`:
        
```
        [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
         [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
         [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
        ```

2.  **Analyze** the 6x6 input grid: Count the total number of pixels with the color azure (value 8).
3.  **Select** the output grid based on the azure pixel count:
    *   If the count is exactly 12, the output is `Pattern 1`.
    *   If the count is exactly 16, the output is `Pattern 2`.
4.  **Return** the selected 5x5 pattern as the final output.
