Task: Determine which of two fixed 5x5 patterns to output based on the input grid.

Input Grid:
  - Size: 6x6
  - Colors: Primarily white (0) and azure (8). Other colors do not appear relevant.
  - Objects: Clusters of azure pixels on a white background. Their shape and position seem irrelevant.

Output Grid:
  - Size: 5x5
  - Content: Always one of two fixed patterns composed of white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - Pattern 1:
      [[0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]
  - Pattern 2:
      [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]]

Transformation Rule:
  - Action: Count the total number of azure (8) pixels in the 6x6 input grid.
  - Condition:
    - If the count of azure pixels is 12, the output is Pattern 1.
    - If the count of azure pixels is 16, the output is Pattern 2.
  - Note: The observed counts in the examples are only 12 and 16. The rule for other counts is unknown but likely follows this mapping if other counts are possible.
