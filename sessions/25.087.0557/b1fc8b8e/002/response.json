This explains why it failed. It was using the wrong rule *and* one of the patterns was slightly incorrect.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\nSince the total count/parity doesn't determine the output pattern, I need to find another property of the input grid that correlates with the choice between Pattern 1 and Pattern 2.\n\nLet's look at the inputs again:\n*   Input 1 (Count 12) -> Pattern 1\n*   Input 2 (Count 16) -> Pattern 2\n*   Input 3 (Count 12) -> Pattern 1\n*   Input 4 (Count 16) -> Pattern 2\n*   Input 5 (Count 12) -> Pattern 1\n\nIt seems like:\n*   If the total count of azure pixels is 12, the output is Pattern 1.\n*   If the total count of azure pixels is 16, the output is Pattern 2.\n\nThis hypothesis fits all 5 examples perfectly.\n\n**Defining the Patterns:**\n\n*   **Pattern 1:**\n    "

The transformation always produces one of these two fixed 5x5 grids.\n\nLet's structure the findings.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified that the output is one of two fixed 5x5 patterns composed of white (0) and azure (8) pixels. However, the rule used to select between the two patterns (parity of the azure pixel count) was incorrect. Additionally, one of the defined output patterns (Pattern B) did not accurately match the expected output for the corresponding examples.\n\nThe provided results show that the previous code failed consistently, always being off by 2 pixels when the expected output was Pattern 1 (Examples 1, 3, 5) and also failing for Pattern 2 (Examples 2, 4), although the specific pixel differences varied because the expected Pattern 2 was different from the `PATTERN_B` used in the code.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correctly identify the two distinct 5x5 output patterns present in the examples.\n2.  Re-analyze the input grids to find the correct property that determines which of the two output patterns is chosen.\n3.  Update the natural language program with the corrected patterns and selection rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's re-examine the relationship between the input azure pixel count and the specific output pattern.\n\n**Output Patterns:**\n\n*   **Pattern 1:** (Observed in examples 1, 3, 5)\n    "
