Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n3. If a pixel in the input grid is white (0):\n    a. Check its 8 neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).\n    b. If any neighbor in the input grid is blue (1), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to yellow (4).\n    c. If no neighbors are blue, the pixel in the output grid remains white (as initialized).\n4.
