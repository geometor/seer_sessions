task_description: Process an input grid based on a central vertical separator line.
grid_properties:
  - input_width: 9
  - input_height: 5
  - output_width: 4
  - output_height: 5
separator:
  - color: yellow (4)
  - location: vertical line at column index 4
  - function: divides input into left (cols 0-3) and right (cols 5-8) subgrids; discarded in output
subgrids:
  - name: left_subgrid
    columns: 0-3
    height: 5
    trigger_color: azure (8)
  - name: right_subgrid
    columns: 5-8
    height: 5
    trigger_color: gray (5)
output_generation:
  - method: cell-wise comparison between left_subgrid and right_subgrid
  - output_colors:
      - red (2)
      - white (0)
  - rule: |
      For each cell position (row r, column c) from 0 to 3:
      Let Left_Pixel = color at (r, c) in left_subgrid.
      Let Right_Pixel = color at (r, c) in right_subgrid.
      Output_Pixel at (r, c) is red (2) if (Left_Pixel is azure (8) AND Right_Pixel is NOT gray (5)) OR (Left_Pixel is NOT azure (8) AND Right_Pixel is gray (5)).
      Otherwise, Output_Pixel at (r, c) is white (0).
      This corresponds to an XOR operation on the trigger conditions.
