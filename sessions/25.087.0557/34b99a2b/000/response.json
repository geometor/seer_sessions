They contain several colors: white (0), azure (8), yellow (4), and gray (5). A defining feature is a single, continuous vertical line of yellow (4) pixels located at column index 4 (the 5th column). This yellow line effectively divides the grid into two smaller subgrids of size 5x4: one to the left (columns 0-3) and one to the right (columns 5-8).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids have the same height (5) but a smaller width of 4. They only contain white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves a reduction in width, specifically removing the central yellow column and the columns to its right, resulting in a 5x4 grid. The colors in the output grid seem dependent on the colors in the *corresponding positions* of the left and right subgrids of the input, relative to the central yellow line.\n4.  **Color Relationships:**\n    *   The yellow (4) column acts as a separator and is discarded.\n    *   White (0) in the input generally corresponds to white (0) in the output, *unless* specific conditions are met.\n    *   Azure (8) pixels *only* appear in the left subgrid (columns 0-3).\n    *   Gray (5) pixels *only* appear in the right subgrid (columns 5-8).\n    *   Red (2) pixels appear in the output at positions `(r, c)`. The presence of red seems determined by whether an azure (8) pixel is at `(r, c)` in the left input subgrid *or* a gray (5) pixel is at `(r, c)` in the right input subgrid, but *not both*. If neither condition is met, or if *both* conditions are met (azure on the left and gray on the right), the output pixel is white (0). This suggests an Exclusive OR (XOR) relationship.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each cell position `(r, c)` within the dimensions of the `Left Subgrid` (and therefore also the `Right Subgrid` and the output grid).\n5.  For the current position `(r, c)`:\n    *   Check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the `Left Subgrid` is azure (8). Let this condition be `isLeftTrigger`.\n    *   Check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the `Right Subgrid` is gray (5). Let this condition be `isRightTrigger`.\n    *   Apply an Exclusive OR (XOR) logic: If `isLeftTrigger` is true and `isRightTrigger` is false, OR if `isLeftTrigger` is false and `isRightTrigger` is true, then set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to red (2).\n    *   Otherwise (if both are true or both are false), leave the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid as white (0).\n6.
