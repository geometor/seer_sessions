Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 5 and a width of 9. They contain several colors: white (0), azure (8), yellow (4), and gray (5). A defining feature is a single, continuous vertical line of yellow (4) pixels located at column index 4 (the 5th column). This yellow line effectively divides the grid into two smaller subgrids of size 5x4: one to the left (columns 0-3) and one to the right (columns 5-8).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids have the same height (5) but a smaller width of 4. They only contain white (0) and red (2) pixels.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves a reduction in width, specifically removing the central yellow column and the columns to its right, resulting in a 5x4 grid. The colors in the output grid seem dependent on the colors in the *corresponding positions* of the left and right subgrids of the input, relative to the central yellow line.
4.  **Color Relationships:**
    *   The yellow (4) column acts as a separator and is discarded.
    *   White (0) in the input generally corresponds to white (0) in the output, *unless* specific conditions are met.
    *   Azure (8) pixels *only* appear in the left subgrid (columns 0-3).
    *   Gray (5) pixels *only* appear in the right subgrid (columns 5-8).
    *   Red (2) pixels appear in the output at positions `(r, c)`. The presence of red seems determined by whether an azure (8) pixel is at `(r, c)` in the left input subgrid *or* a gray (5) pixel is at `(r, c)` in the right input subgrid, but *not both*. If neither condition is met, or if *both* conditions are met (azure on the left and gray on the right), the output pixel is white (0). This suggests an Exclusive OR (XOR) relationship.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Process an input grid based on a central vertical separator line.
grid_properties:
  - input_width: 9
  - input_height: 5
  - output_width: 4
  - output_height: 5
separator:
  - color: yellow (4)
  - location: vertical line at column index 4
  - function: divides input into left (cols 0-3) and right (cols 5-8) subgrids; discarded in output
subgrids:
  - name: left_subgrid
    columns: 0-3
    height: 5
    trigger_color: azure (8)
  - name: right_subgrid
    columns: 5-8
    height: 5
    trigger_color: gray (5)
output_generation:
  - method: cell-wise comparison between left_subgrid and right_subgrid
  - output_colors:
      - red (2)
      - white (0)
  - rule: |
      For each cell position (row r, column c) from 0 to 3:
      Let Left_Pixel = color at (r, c) in left_subgrid.
      Let Right_Pixel = color at (r, c) in right_subgrid.
      Output_Pixel at (r, c) is red (2) if (Left_Pixel is azure (8) AND Right_Pixel is NOT gray (5)) OR (Left_Pixel is NOT azure (8) AND Right_Pixel is gray (5)).
      Otherwise, Output_Pixel at (r, c) is white (0).
      This corresponds to an XOR operation on the trigger conditions.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the vertical separator line composed of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. (It is consistently at column index 4).
2.   conceptually divide the input grid into three parts based on this separator:
    *   The `Left Subgrid` (columns 0 to 3).
    *   The `Separator Column` (column 4).
    *   The `Right Subgrid` (columns 5 to 8).
3.  Create a new output grid with the same height as the input grid and a width equal to the width of the `Left Subgrid` (which is 4 columns). Initialize all cells to white (0).
4.  Iterate through each cell position `(r, c)` within the dimensions of the `Left Subgrid` (and therefore also the `Right Subgrid` and the output grid).
5.  For the current position `(r, c)`:
    *   Check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the `Left Subgrid` is azure (8). Let this condition be `isLeftTrigger`.
    *   Check if the pixel at `(r, c)` in the `Right Subgrid` is gray (5). Let this condition be `isRightTrigger`.
    *   Apply an Exclusive OR (XOR) logic: If `isLeftTrigger` is true and `isRightTrigger` is false, OR if `isLeftTrigger` is false and `isRightTrigger` is true, then set the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to red (2).
    *   Otherwise (if both are true or both are false), leave the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid as white (0).
6.  The resulting grid is the final output.
