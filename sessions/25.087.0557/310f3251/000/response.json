It depends on the positions of the non-white pixels in the *original* input grid. Specifically, if a non-white pixel exists at position `(r, c)` in the input, the pixel at the diagonally up-left position `(r-1, c-1)` in the input grid, *if it was originally white*, will have its corresponding positions in the tiled output grid changed to red (2). If the `(r-1, c-1)` position is outside the input grid boundaries or was not originally white, no change occurs based on that specific non-white pixel.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
