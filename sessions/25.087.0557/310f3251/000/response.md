Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Transformation:** The core task is transforming an input grid into a larger output grid.
2.  **Scaling:** The output grid's dimensions (height and width) are consistently 3 times the dimensions of the input grid.
3.  **Tiling:** The pattern of the input grid is repeated or tiled 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically to form the basic structure of the output grid.
4.  **Color Modification:** While the original input pattern is largely preserved in the tiling, some white pixels (0) from the input pattern are changed to red pixels (2) in the output grid.
5.  **Rule for Color Change:** The change from white (0) to red (2) is not random. It depends on the positions of the non-white pixels in the *original* input grid. Specifically, if a non-white pixel exists at position `(r, c)` in the input, the pixel at the diagonally up-left position `(r-1, c-1)` in the input grid, *if it was originally white*, will have its corresponding positions in the tiled output grid changed to red (2). If the `(r-1, c-1)` position is outside the input grid boundaries or was not originally white, no change occurs based on that specific non-white pixel.

**YAML Facts:**

components:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - variable_size
      - contains_pixels_0_to_9
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - size_relation: height is 3 * input_height, width is 3 * input_width
      - contains_pixels_0_to_9
transformation:
  - action: scale_and_tile
    input: input_grid
    output: intermediate_grid
    details: Tile the input_grid 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically. The intermediate_grid has dimensions 3*H x 3*W where H, W are input dimensions.
  - action: conditional_color_change
    input: input_grid
    target: intermediate_grid
    output: output_grid
    details:
      - Identify all non-white pixel locations (r, c) in the input_grid.
      - For each non-white pixel at (r, c):
          - Calculate target location (tr, tc) = (r-1, c-1).
          - Check if (tr, tc) is within the bounds of the input_grid.
          - Check if the pixel at input_grid[tr][tc] is white (0).
          - If both conditions are true:
              - In the intermediate_grid, change the color to red (2) at all locations corresponding to the input location (tr, tc). These are locations (tr + i*H, tc + j*W) for i in [0, 1, 2] and j in [0, 1, 2].
      - The final modified intermediate_grid is the output_grid.
constants:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - modification_color: red (2)
  - tiling_factor: 3

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 3\*H and width 3\*W.
3.  Fill the output grid by tiling the input grid pattern 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically. Specifically, the pixel at `output_grid[r][c]` should initially have the same color as `input_grid[r % H][c % W]`.
4.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the *original* input grid.
5.  If the pixel `input_grid[r][c]` is *not* white (i.e., its value is greater than 0):
    a.  Define the target coordinates `tr = r - 1` and `tc = c - 1`.
    b.  Check if `tr` and `tc` are valid coordinates within the bounds of the *original* input grid (i.e., `0 <= tr < H` and `0 <= tc < W`).
    c.  If the target coordinates `(tr, tc)` are valid, check if the pixel `input_grid[tr][tc]` is white (0).
    d.  If both conditions (valid coordinates and white target pixel) are met, then modify the *output* grid: For each horizontal tile `j` from 0 to 2 and each vertical tile `i` from 0 to 2, set the pixel at `output_grid[tr + i*H][tc + j*W]` to red (2).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
