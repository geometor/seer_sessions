            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code successfully identified the core transformation mechanism: scaling the input grid by 3x and replacing each input pixel with a corresponding 3x3 pattern in the output grid. However, the specific 3x3 patterns used in the code were incorrect, derived only from the first example and not generalizing to the others. The errors indicate that the patterns associated with the input pixel colors (both white/0 and non-zero colors) were misspecified. The strategy for resolving the errors is to re-examine all input-output pairs to determine the correct and consistent 3x3 patterns for each input pixel color.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe analysis involved comparing the `Expected Output` with the `Transformed Output` from the previous code for each example, focusing on the 3x3 blocks corresponding to each input pixel.\n\n"
