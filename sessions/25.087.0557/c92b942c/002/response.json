            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code failed because the assumed 3x3 patterns for input colors 0 (white) and non-zero colors were incorrect. The initial hypothesis was based only on the first example and misinterpreted the specific pixel arrangements within the 3x3 output blocks corresponding to each input pixel. Analysis across all four examples reveals consistent, but different, mapping rules for white (0) and non-zero input pixels. The core concept of expanding the grid by 3x and mapping each input pixel to a 3x3 block remains valid, but the specific patterns within those blocks need correction.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n1.  Identify the correct 3x3 output pattern associated with input color 0 (white) by observing its consistent mapping across all examples.\n2.  Identify the correct 3x3 output pattern associated with non-zero input colors (2, 4, 5, 6 observed) by observing their consistent mapping across all examples. Note that the non-zero pattern incorporates the original input color `C`.\n3.  Update the natural language program and subsequently the code to use these corrected patterns.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nBased on comparing the input grids and expected output grids across all four examples:\n\n1.  **Dimensionality:** In all examples, the output grid's height and width are exactly 3 times the input grid's height and width.\n    *   Ex 1: Input 3x3 -> Output 9x9\n    *   Ex 2: Input 2x4 -> Output 6x12\n    *   Ex 3: Input 4x6 -> Output 12x18\n    *   Ex 4: Input 5x5 -> Output 15x15\n2.  **Mapping:** Each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at `(r*3, c*3)`.\n3.  **Pattern Consistency (Input 0 - white):** Whenever an input pixel is 0 (white), the corresponding 3x3 block in the *expected* output is consistently:\n    "

This mismatch in the specific pixel values within the 3x3 blocks explains the high `Pixels Off` count and `Match: False` results for all examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
