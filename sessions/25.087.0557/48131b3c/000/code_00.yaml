task_description: Create a larger grid by transforming and tiling the input grid.
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - shape: square (N x N)
      - colors: contains exactly two colors - 'white' (0) and one non-white color (C).
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: output
      - shape: square (2N x 2N)
      - colors: contains the same two colors as the input ('white' and C).
transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: color_swap
    input: input grid
    output: intermediate grid (N x N)
    details: Create a new grid of the same size as the input. For each pixel, if the color is 'white' (0), change it to the non-white color C. If the color is C, change it to 'white' (0).
  - step: 2
    action: tiling
    input: intermediate grid
    output: output grid (2N x 2N)
    details: Arrange four copies of the intermediate grid in a 2x2 pattern to form the final output grid.
relationships:
  - Output height is 2 times Input height.
  - Output width is 2 times Input width.
  - The output grid consists of four identical quadrants.
  - Each quadrant of the output grid is the color-swapped version of the input grid.
