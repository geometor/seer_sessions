Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Each example takes a relatively small square grid as input and produces a larger square grid as output.
2.  **Dimensions:** The output grid dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the input grid dimensions.
    *   Example 1: Input 3x3 -> Output 6x6
    *   Example 2: Input 2x2 -> Output 4x4
    *   Example 3: Input 4x4 -> Output 8x8
3.  **Colors:** Each input grid uses exactly two colors: 'white' (0) and one other non-white color (azure-8, orange-7, yellow-4). The output grid uses the same two colors.
4.  **Pattern Repetition:** The output grid appears to be composed of four identical quadrants. Each quadrant seems related to the input grid.
5.  **Color Transformation:** Comparing a quadrant of the output to the input grid, the pattern is the same, but the colors are inverted. Where the input had 'white', the output quadrant has the non-white color, and vice-versa.
6.  **Overall Transformation:** The process seems to involve two steps:
    *   First, create an intermediate grid by swapping the two colors present in the input grid.
    *   Second, construct the final output grid by tiling this intermediate grid in a 2x2 arrangement.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Create a larger grid by transforming and tiling the input grid.
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: input
      - shape: square (N x N)
      - colors: contains exactly two colors - 'white' (0) and one non-white color (C).
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - type: output
      - shape: square (2N x 2N)
      - colors: contains the same two colors as the input ('white' and C).
transformation:
  - step: 1
    action: color_swap
    input: input grid
    output: intermediate grid (N x N)
    details: Create a new grid of the same size as the input. For each pixel, if the color is 'white' (0), change it to the non-white color C. If the color is C, change it to 'white' (0).
  - step: 2
    action: tiling
    input: intermediate grid
    output: output grid (2N x 2N)
    details: Arrange four copies of the intermediate grid in a 2x2 pattern to form the final output grid.
relationships:
  - Output height is 2 times Input height.
  - Output width is 2 times Input width.
  - The output grid consists of four identical quadrants.
  - Each quadrant of the output grid is the color-swapped version of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid: one will be 'white' (0) and the other will be a non-white color (let's call it `C`).
2.  Create a new grid, `intermediate_grid`, with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's color is 'white' (0), set the corresponding pixel in `intermediate_grid` to color `C`.
    *   If the pixel's color is `C`, set the corresponding pixel in `intermediate_grid` to 'white' (0).
4.  Create the final `output_grid` with dimensions twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
5.  Place the `intermediate_grid` into the top-left quadrant of the `output_grid`.
6.  Place the `intermediate_grid` into the top-right quadrant of the `output_grid`.
7.  Place the `intermediate_grid` into the bottom-left quadrant of the `output_grid`.
8.  Place the `intermediate_grid` into the bottom-right quadrant of the `output_grid`.
9.  Return the `output_grid`.
