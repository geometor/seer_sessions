The output grid uses the same two colors.\n4.  **Pattern Repetition:** The output grid appears to be composed of four identical quadrants. Each quadrant seems related to the input grid.\n5.  **Color Transformation:** Comparing a quadrant of the output to the input grid, the pattern is the same, but the colors are inverted. Where the input had 'white', the output quadrant has the non-white color, and vice-versa.\n6.  **Overall Transformation:** The process seems to involve two steps:\n    *   First, create an intermediate grid by swapping the two colors present in the input grid.\n    *   Second, construct the final output grid by tiling this intermediate grid in a 2x2 arrangement.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
