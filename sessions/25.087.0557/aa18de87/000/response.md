Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a background color (white, 0) and a sparse scattering of pixels of a single, non-white color. This non-white color varies across examples (green, yellow, azure, blue).
2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, some previously white pixels are changed to red (2).
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The red pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of the original non-white pixels.
4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The filling with red occurs only horizontally. Specifically, if two non-white pixels exist in the same row, and all the pixels strictly between them in that row are white, then those intermediate white pixels are turned red.
5.  **Color Consistency:** The original non-white color acts as the "endpoint" marker, but the fill color is consistently red (2), regardless of the endpoint color.
6.  **No Vertical Filling:** There's no evidence of filling between vertically aligned non-white pixels in any of the examples.
7.  **No Diagonal Filling:** There's no evidence of filling between diagonally aligned non-white pixels.
8.  **Contiguity Check:** The filling only happens if the entire segment *between* the endpoints is white. If any non-white pixel (even another endpoint) exists within that segment, no filling occurs for that specific pair.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Fill horizontal segments between pairs of non-white pixels with red.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - object: background_pixel
    property:
      color: white (0)
  - object: endpoint_pixel
    property:
      color: non-white (varies per example: 1, 3, 4, 8)
      role: Marks the start and end of potential fill segments.
  - object: fill_pixel
    property:
      color: red (2)
      role: Fills the space between horizontally adjacent endpoint_pixels.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Two endpoint_pixels are considered horizontally adjacent if they are in the same row.
  - type: intermediate_path
    description: The set of pixels located strictly between two horizontally adjacent endpoint_pixels in the same row.

actions:
  - name: identify_endpoints
    description: Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
  - name: find_horizontal_pairs
    description: For each row, identify all pairs of endpoint_pixels within that row.
  - name: check_path_emptiness
    description: For each horizontal pair, verify that all pixels in the intermediate_path between them are white (0).
  - name: fill_path
    input: A horizontal pair with an empty (white) intermediate_path.
    output: Change the color of all pixels in the intermediate_path to red (2).
    condition: The intermediate_path must consist entirely of white (0) pixels.

output_specification:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All original endpoint_pixels retain their position and color.
  - Pixels identified as belonging to an empty intermediate_path between a horizontal pair of endpoint_pixels are changed to red (2).
  - All other background_pixels remain white (0).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the working output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3.  For the current row, find the column indices of all pixels that are *not* white (0). Let these be the "endpoint" columns for this row.
4.  If there are fewer than two endpoint columns in the current row, proceed to the next row.
5.  If there are two or more endpoint columns, sort them in ascending order.
6.  Iterate through consecutive pairs of endpoint columns in the sorted list (e.g., the 1st and 2nd, the 2nd and 3rd, etc.). Let a pair be `col1` and `col2`, where `col1 < col2`.
7.  Check if all pixels in the current row, located at column indices strictly between `col1` and `col2` (i.e., from `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1`), are white (0) in the *original input grid*.
8.  If the condition in step 7 is true, then for each column index `c` from `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1`, change the color of the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *working output grid* to red (2).
9.  After iterating through all rows, the working output grid contains the final result. Return this grid.
