            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consist primarily of a background color (white, 0) and a sparse scattering of pixels of a single, non-white color. This non-white color varies across examples (green, yellow, azure, blue).\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids retain the original non-white pixels from the input. Additionally, some previously white pixels are changed to red (2).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The red pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of the original non-white pixels.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship:** The filling with red occurs only horizontally. Specifically, if two non-white pixels exist in the same row, and all the pixels strictly between them in that row are white, then those intermediate white pixels are turned red.\n5.  **Color Consistency:** The original non-white color acts as the \"endpoint\" marker, but the fill color is consistently red (2), regardless of the endpoint color.\n6.  **No Vertical Filling:** There's no evidence of filling between vertically aligned non-white pixels in any of the examples.\n7.  **No Diagonal Filling:** There's no evidence of filling between diagonally aligned non-white pixels.\n8.  **Contiguity Check:** The filling only happens if the entire segment *between* the endpoints is white. If any non-white pixel (even another endpoint) exists within that segment, no filling occurs for that specific pair.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If there are two or more endpoint columns, sort them in ascending order.\n6.  Iterate through consecutive pairs of endpoint columns in the sorted list (e.g., the 1st and 2nd, the 2nd and 3rd, etc.). Let a pair be `col1` and `col2`, where `col1 < col2`.\n7.  Check if all pixels in the current row, located at column indices strictly between `col1` and `col2` (i.e., from `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1`), are white (0) in the *original input grid*.\n8.  If the condition in step 7 is true, then for each column index `c` from `col1 + 1` to `col2 - 1`, change the color of the pixel at the current row and column `c` in the *working output grid* to red (2).\n9.  After iterating through all rows, the working output grid contains the final result. Return this grid."
