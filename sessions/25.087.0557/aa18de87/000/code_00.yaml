task_description: Fill horizontal segments between pairs of non-white pixels with red.

elements:
  - object: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values representing colors.
  - object: background_pixel
    property:
      color: white (0)
  - object: endpoint_pixel
    property:
      color: non-white (varies per example: 1, 3, 4, 8)
      role: Marks the start and end of potential fill segments.
  - object: fill_pixel
    property:
      color: red (2)
      role: Fills the space between horizontally adjacent endpoint_pixels.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    description: Two endpoint_pixels are considered horizontally adjacent if they are in the same row.
  - type: intermediate_path
    description: The set of pixels located strictly between two horizontally adjacent endpoint_pixels in the same row.

actions:
  - name: identify_endpoints
    description: Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
  - name: find_horizontal_pairs
    description: For each row, identify all pairs of endpoint_pixels within that row.
  - name: check_path_emptiness
    description: For each horizontal pair, verify that all pixels in the intermediate_path between them are white (0).
  - name: fill_path
    input: A horizontal pair with an empty (white) intermediate_path.
    output: Change the color of all pixels in the intermediate_path to red (2).
    condition: The intermediate_path must consist entirely of white (0) pixels.

output_specification:
  - The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - All original endpoint_pixels retain their position and color.
  - Pixels identified as belonging to an empty intermediate_path between a horizontal pair of endpoint_pixels are changed to red (2).
  - All other background_pixels remain white (0).
