Red (2) and white (0) constitute the content of the output.\n4.  **Structure:** In each input grid, there are multiple instances of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels. Crucially, there are pairs of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels located on the *same row*.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be constructed by extracting specific horizontal segments from the input grid, guided by the locations of the blue (1) and azure (8) pairs.\n6.  **Extraction Logic:** For each pair of blue (1) and azure (8) pixels found on the same row, the segment of that row lying strictly *between* the blue and azure pixels is extracted.\n7.  **Output Construction:** The extracted horizontal segments are stacked vertically to form the final output grid. The order of stacking preserves the original top-to-bottom order of the rows from which the segments were extracted. The width of the output grid is determined by the length of these extracted segments (which is consistent within each example), and the height is determined by the number of such blue-azure pairs found on distinct rows.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If they both exist (assuming there's exactly one of each per relevant row, or the first/min/max pair is relevant):\n    a.  Find the column index of the blue pixel (`blue_col`).\n    b.  Find the column index of the azure pixel (`azure_col`).\n    c.  Determine the leftmost column index (`min_col = min(blue_col, azure_col)`) and the rightmost column index (`max_col = max(blue_col, azure_col)`).\n    d.  Extract the segment of the current row starting from the column *after* `min_col` up to the column *before* `max_col`. This is the slice `input_row[min_col + 1 : max_col]`.\n    e.  Add this extracted segment as a new row to the list initialized in step 1.\n6.  After iterating through all rows of the input grid, assemble the collected segments (rows) into the final output grid. The order of segments in the list corresponds to the top-to-bottom order in the output grid."
