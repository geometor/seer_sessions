task_elements:
  - Input Grid: A 2D array of pixels with colors white(0), blue(1), red(2), azure(8).
  - Output Grid: A smaller 2D array of pixels containing only white(0) and red(2).
  - Markers:
      - Blue Pixels (1): Act as start/end markers for horizontal segments.
      - Azure Pixels (8): Act as end/start markers for horizontal segments.
  - Content Pixels: Red(2) and White(0) pixels form the content of the output.
relationships:
  - Horizontal Pairs: Blue(1) and Azure(8) pixels form pairs on the same row.
  - Segment Definition: Each horizontal pair defines a segment on its row, located strictly between the blue and azure columns.
  - Output Structure: The output grid is formed by vertically stacking the extracted segments.
properties:
  - Segment Consistency: Within a single input, all extracted segments have the same length.
  - Order Preservation: The vertical order of the segments in the output matches the row order in the input.
actions:
  - Identify Pairs: Find all rows containing both a blue(1) and an azure(8) pixel.
  - Determine Boundaries: For each pair, find the minimum and maximum column indices (min_col, max_col) of the blue and azure pixels.
  - Extract Segment: Select the pixels from the row between columns min_col + 1 and max_col - 1 (exclusive of the markers).
  - Stack Segments: Collect all extracted segments and arrange them as rows in a new grid, maintaining their original relative vertical order.
