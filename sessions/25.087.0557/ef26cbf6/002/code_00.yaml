description: Analysis of task based on initial code execution results.
task_name: unnamed_task # Requires actual task ID if known
elements:
  - element: grid
    properties:
      - background_color: white (0)
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
  - element: separator
    properties:
      - type: horizontal
      - color: yellow (4)
      - extent: spans full grid width
      - location: variable rows
      - function: divides grid into horizontal bands
    properties:
      - type: vertical
      - color: yellow (4)
      - extent: spans full grid height
      - location: variable columns
      - function: divides grid into vertical bands
  - element: zone
    properties:
      - definition: rectangular area bounded by separators and/or grid edges
      - content: can contain source objects, target objects, or be empty
  - element: source_object
    properties:
      - definition: contiguous object of a single color
      - color: any color except white (0), blue (1), yellow (4)
      - location: resides within a single zone
      - role: provides color for mapping
  - element: target_object
    properties:
      - definition: contiguous object of a single color
      - color: blue (1)
      - location: resides within a single zone
      - role: receives color during mapping
actions:
  - action: identify_zones
    description: Locate all full horizontal and vertical yellow lines to define rectangular zones.
  - action: identify_objects_per_zone
    description: For each zone, find all source objects and target objects.
  - action: map_colors
    description: Determine pairings between source objects and target objects based on zone relationships.
    rules:
      - rule: intra_zone_mapping
        condition: A zone contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects.
        effect: The source object maps its color to all target objects in that same zone.
      - rule: inter_zone_horizontal_mapping
        condition: A zone Z_src at (row_band, col_band_1) contains exactly one source object S, and another zone Z_tgt at (row_band, col_band_2) in the same row_band contains one or more target objects T.
        effect: Source S maps its color to all targets T in Z_tgt. (Priority might be needed for multiple sources/targets). Example 2 suggests mapping happens between adjacent columns within the same row band.
      - rule: inter_zone_vertical_mapping
        condition: A zone Z_src at (row_band_1, col_band) contains exactly one source object S, and another zone Z_tgt at (row_band_2, col_band) in the same col_band contains one or more target objects T, where row_band_1 and row_band_2 are separated by exactly one horizontal separator.
        effect: Source S maps its color to all targets T in Z_tgt. Example 1 suggests this mapping.
    post_conditions:
      - Each source object participates in at most one mapping rule application.
      - Source objects used in mapping are marked.
      - Target objects receiving color are marked.
  - action: apply_transformation
    description: Modify a copy of the input grid based on the mappings.
    steps:
      - step: color_targets
        effect: For each mapping from source S to target T, change the color of all pixels belonging to T to the color of S.
      - step: clear_sources
        effect: Change the color of all pixels belonging to mapped source objects to white (0).
