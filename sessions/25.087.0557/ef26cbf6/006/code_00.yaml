grid_properties:
  - structure: Divided into rectangular zones by solid yellow horizontal and vertical lines.
  - background_color: white (0)
  - separator_color: yellow (4)

objects:
  - type: source
    color: Any color except white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4).
    description: Represents the origin of a color transformation.
    persistence: Remains unchanged in the output grid.
  - type: target
    color: blue (1)
    description: Represents the destination of a color transformation. Receives color from a mapped source.
  - type: separator
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Forms the boundaries of zones. Can be full rows or columns.
    persistence: Remains unchanged in the output grid.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default empty space within zones.
    persistence: Remains unchanged unless it's part of a target object that gets colored.

zones:
  - definition: Rectangular areas defined by grid boundaries and yellow separator lines.
  - identification: Determined by finding rows and columns composed entirely of yellow pixels.
  - properties: Each zone has coordinates (zone_row, zone_col). Contains zero or more source objects and zero or more target objects.

actions:
  - name: identify_zones
    description: Locate all horizontal and vertical yellow separators to define zone boundaries.
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Within each zone, find all contiguous source objects and target objects. Record their color, pixels, and zone location.
  - name: determine_mappings
    description: Map source objects to target objects based on specific rules, prioritizing mappings that satisfy the conditions first. Mark objects as mapped once used in a rule.
    rules:
      - rule_1_intra_zone: If a zone contains exactly one unmapped source object and one or more unmapped target objects, map that source to all those targets.
      - rule_2_inter_zone_vertical: If a zone contains exactly one unmapped source object and a vertically adjacent zone (sharing a horizontal border segment, not just a corner) contains one or more unmapped target objects, map that source to all those targets in the adjacent zone. Check both directions (source above targets, source below targets).
      - rule_3_inter_zone_horizontal: If a zone contains exactly one unmapped source object and a horizontally adjacent zone (sharing a vertical border segment, not just a corner) contains one or more unmapped target objects, map that source to all those targets in the adjacent zone. Check both directions (source left of targets, source right of targets).
  - name: apply_transformation
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each mapping found, change the color of all pixels belonging to the target object(s) to the color of the mapped source object. Source objects remain unchanged.

output:
  - description: The modified grid after applying the color transformations to target objects. Separators and original source objects persist.
