## General Assessment

The provided code successfully identifies the grid structure (zones separated by yellow lines), locates source objects (non-white/blue/yellow) and target objects (blue), and applies the correct color transformation from sources to targets based on the zone mapping rules (intra-zone and adjacent inter-zone). However, it incorrectly removes the original source objects by changing their pixels to white (0) after the mapping. The expected outputs clearly show that the source objects should remain unchanged in their original positions and colors.

The strategy for resolving the errors is straightforward: modify the code to prevent the removal of source objects. This involves removing the step where source pixels are identified and subsequently changed to the background color (white). The rest of the logic concerning zone identification, object finding, and target coloring appears correct based on the provided examples.

    description: Represents the destination of a color transformation. Receives color from a mapped source.
  - type: separator
    color: yellow (4)
    description: Forms the boundaries of zones. Can be full rows or columns.
    persistence: Remains unchanged in the output grid.
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The default empty space within zones.
    persistence: Remains unchanged unless it's part of a target object that gets colored.

zones:
  - definition: Rectangular areas defined by grid boundaries and yellow separator lines.
  - identification: Determined by finding rows and columns composed entirely of yellow pixels.
  - properties: Each zone has coordinates (zone_row, zone_col). Contains zero or more source objects and zero or more target objects.

actions:
  - name: identify_zones
    description: Locate all horizontal and vertical yellow separators to define zone boundaries.
  - name: identify_objects
    description: Within each zone, find all contiguous source objects and target objects. Record their color, pixels, and zone location.
  - name: determine_mappings
    description: Map source objects to target objects based on specific rules, prioritizing mappings that satisfy the conditions first. Mark objects as mapped once used in a rule.
    rules:
      - rule_1_intra_zone: If a zone contains exactly one unmapped source object and one or more unmapped target objects, map that source to all those targets.
      - rule_2_inter_zone_vertical: If a zone contains exactly one unmapped source object and a vertically adjacent zone (sharing a horizontal border segment, not just a corner) contains one or more unmapped target objects, map that source to all those targets in the adjacent zone. Check both directions (source above targets, source below targets).
      - rule_3_inter_zone_horizontal: If a zone contains exactly one unmapped source object and a horizontally adjacent zone (sharing a vertical border segment, not just a corner) contains one or more unmapped target objects, map that source to all those targets in the adjacent zone. Check both directions (source left of targets, source right of targets).
  - name: apply_transformation
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each mapping found, change the color of all pixels belonging to the target object(s) to the color of the mapped source object. Source objects remain unchanged.

output:
  - description: The modified grid after applying the color transformations to target objects. Separators and original source objects persist.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Analyze Grid Structure**: Identify all complete horizontal and vertical lines composed solely of yellow (4) pixels. These lines, along with the grid borders, define distinct rectangular zones.
2.  **Identify Objects within Zones**:
    *   For each zone:
        *   Find all contiguous groups of pixels that are not white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4). These are 'source' objects. Record their color, constituent pixel coordinates, and the zone they belong to.
        *   Find all contiguous groups of pixels that are blue (1). These are 'target' objects. Record their color (blue), constituent pixel coordinates, and the zone they belong to.
3.  **Establish Mappings**: Determine which source objects provide color for which target objects according to the following prioritized rules. Once a source or target object is used in a mapping, it cannot be used again.
    *   **Rule 1 (Intra-Zone)**: For each zone, if it contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and one or more *unmapped* target objects, map this source object to *all* those target objects within the same zone. Mark the source and target objects as mapped.
    *   **Rule 2 (Inter-Zone Vertical)**: Check pairs of vertically adjacent zones. If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both directions (source above targets, source below targets). Mark the involved source and target objects as mapped.
    *   **Rule 3 (Inter-Zone Horizontal)**: Check pairs of horizontally adjacent zones. If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both directions (source left of targets, source right of targets). Mark the involved source and target objects as mapped.
4.  **Apply Transformations**: Create a copy of the input grid. For every mapping created in step 3:
    *   Iterate through all the pixel coordinates associated with the target object(s) in the mapping.
    *   Change the color of these pixels in the copied grid to the color of the corresponding source object.
5.  **Output**: Return the modified grid. The original source objects and yellow separator lines remain unchanged from the input grid.
