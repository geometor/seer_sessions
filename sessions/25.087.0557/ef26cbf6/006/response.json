            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully identifies the grid structure (zones separated by yellow lines), locates source objects (non-white/blue/yellow) and target objects (blue), and applies the correct color transformation from sources to targets based on the zone mapping rules (intra-zone and adjacent inter-zone). However, it incorrectly removes the original source objects by changing their pixels to white (0) after the mapping. The expected outputs clearly show that the source objects should remain unchanged in their original positions and colors.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors is straightforward: modify the code to prevent the removal of source objects. This involves removing the step where source pixels are identified and subsequently changed to the background color (white). The rest of the logic concerning zone identification, object finding, and target coloring appears correct based on the provided examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\n"

These lines, along with the grid borders, define distinct rectangular zones.\n2.  **Identify Objects within Zones**:\n    *   For each zone:\n        *   Find all contiguous groups of pixels that are not white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4). These are 'source' objects. Record their color, constituent pixel coordinates, and the zone they belong to.\n        *   Find all contiguous groups of pixels that are blue (1). These are 'target' objects. Record their color (blue), constituent pixel coordinates, and the zone they belong to.\n3.  **Establish Mappings**: Determine which source objects provide color for which target objects according to the following prioritized rules. Once a source or target object is used in a mapping, it cannot be used again.\n    *   **Rule 1 (Intra-Zone)**: For each zone, if it contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and one or more *unmapped* target objects, map this source object to *all* those target objects within the same zone. Mark the source and target objects as mapped.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Inter-Zone Vertical)**: Check pairs of vertically adjacent zones. If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both directions (source above targets, source below targets). Mark the involved source and target objects as mapped.\n    *   **Rule 3 (Inter-Zone Horizontal)**: Check pairs of horizontally adjacent zones. If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both directions (source left of targets, source right of targets). Mark the involved source and target objects as mapped.\n4.  **Apply Transformations**: Create a copy of the input grid. For every mapping created in step 3:\n    *   Iterate through all the pixel coordinates associated with the target object(s) in the mapping.\n    *   Change the color of these pixels in the copied grid to the color of the corresponding source object.\n5.  **Output**: Return the modified grid.
