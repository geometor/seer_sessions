The transformation rule involves identifying horizontal regions separated by yellow lines (color 4). 
Within these regions, blue objects (color 1) act as targets, and objects of other colors (excluding white 0 and yellow 4) act as sources.

1.  **Region Identification**: Find horizontal lines of yellow pixels (color 4) that span the entire width of the grid. These lines, along with the top and bottom grid boundaries, define distinct horizontal regions.

2.  **Object Identification**: Within each region, identify all contiguous objects of blue color (1) as 'target' objects and all contiguous objects of any color other than white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4) as 'source' objects. Store their color, pixel coordinates, bounding box, and the index of the region they belong to.

3.  **Mapping Logic**: Determine how source colors map to target objects:
    a.  **Same-Region Mapping**: If a region contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects, all target objects in that region take the color of that single source object. Mark these source and target objects as 'mapped'.
    b.  **Cross-Region Mapping**: Consider all 'unmapped' source objects and 'unmapped' target objects from all regions. Sort the unmapped source objects from left to right based on their minimum column index. Sort the unmapped target objects similarly. If the number of unmapped sources equals the number of unmapped targets, map the color of the i-th sorted source object to the i-th sorted target object. Mark these objects as 'mapped'.

4.  **Applying Transformation**:
    a.  Create a copy of the input grid.
    b.  For each mapping determined in step 3, change the color of all pixels belonging to the target object to the corresponding source object's color in the copied grid.
    c.  For every source object that was used in a mapping (i.e., marked as 'mapped'), change the color of its original pixels to white (0) in the copied grid.

5.  **Output**: Return the modified grid.

**Analysis of Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:** The code correctly identified 3 sources in Region 0 and 6 targets (blue objects) in Region 1. Crucially, it confirms `Total Sources` (3) != `Total Targets` (6), so the original cross-region rule (`len(unmapped_sources) == len(unmapped_targets)`) fails, explaining why no transformation happened. The previous visual analysis suggested vertical separators and mapping *within columns* across the horizontal separator. This seems like the key insight. The original code only considers horizontal separators.
*   **Example 2:** The code confirms that the `same-region` rule applies to all three regions (1 source, >0 targets in each). It also correctly identifies the single pixel for each source object: `{(1, 1), (9, 1), (5, 1)}`. This reinforces the mystery of why these pixels were not cleared in the actual output.

**Revisiting the Clearing Bug (Example 2):**
Given the analysis confirms the source pixels *should* be identified correctly and added to `source_pixels_to_clear`, and the clearing loop comes *after* the coloring loop, why does it fail?
Possibility 1: Python set iteration issue? Extremely unlikely.
Possibility 2: Numpy array modification issue? Also unlikely, standard indexing.
Possibility 3: Interaction with ARC environment/tester? Maybe the tester has a bug, or there's a misunderstanding of how the grid is finalized. Unlikely to be the primary assumption.
Possibility 4: Subtle bug in my code logic I missed. Let's re-read carefully.
    *   `output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)` - Creates a distinct copy. Good.
    *   `mappings.append((source_color, target_obj['pixels']))` - Stores color and target pixels.
    *   `source_pixels_to_clear.update(source_pixels)` - Adds source pixels to a set.
    *   `for source_color, target_pixels in mappings:` - Loop 1: Colors targets.
        *   `output_grid[r, c] = source_color`
    *   `for r, c in source_pixels_to_clear:` - Loop 2: Clears sources.
        *   `output_grid[r, c] = 0`
    This order seems correct. Coloring targets first, then clearing sources ensures that if a source pixel happens to *also* be a target pixel (not expected in this problem, but possible generally), it ends up cleared (white). If the order were reversed, a source pixel that was also a target might end up colored instead of cleared. The current order favors clearing.

    Could the issue be in `find_objects` identifying pixels incorrectly? The bounding boxes look okay. Let's re-examine Example 2 expected output vs actual:
    Expected: `(1,1)` is 0. Actual: `(1,1)` is 7.
    Expected: `(5,1)` is 0. Actual: `(5,1)` is 3.
    Expected: `(9,1)` is 0. Actual: `(9,1)` is 8.
    The clearing step `output_grid[r, c] = 0` for `(r,c)` in `{(1, 1), (9, 1), (5, 1)}` seems to have no effect. This is deeply strange if the code execution environment is standard Python/Numpy.

    *Is it possible the `source_obj['pixels']` set is modified after being added to `source_pixels_to_clear`?* No, `update` copies the elements.
    *Is it possible the same pixel coordinates end up in `target_pixels` for some mapping *and* in `source_pixels_to_clear`?* If so, the target coloring happens first, then the source clearing happens second, so it should end up white (0).

    Let's reconsider the Example 1 logic again. Vertical separators.
    If vertical separators define columns, and mapping happens within columns across the horizontal separator...
    *   Column 1 (0-2): Source Green(3) maps to Target Blue(1) cluster -> Target becomes Green. Source Green is cleared.
    *   Column 2 (4-6): Source Red(2) maps to Target Blue(1) cluster -> Target becomes Red. Source Red is cleared.
    *   Column 3 (8-10): Source Magenta(6) maps to Target Blue(1) cluster -> Target becomes Magenta. Source Magenta is cleared.

    This revised logic fits Example 1 perfectly. Does it fit Example 2?
    *   Example 2 has a vertical separator at col 3.
    *   Column 1 (0-2): Contains sources (Orange, Green, Azure). Contains no targets.
    *   Column 2 (4-6): Contains targets (all the blue ones). Contains no sources.
    *   Horizontal separators define regions R0, R1, R2.
    *   How does the mapping work now?
        *   Maybe it's: Find source S in column C1 and region R. Find targets T in column C2 and region R. If C1 != C2, map S to T?
        *   In R0: Source Orange (col 1) maps to Targets Blue (col 4-6)? Yes, fits output. Source cleared.
        *   In R1: Source Green (col 1) maps to Target Blue (col 4-6)? Yes, fits output. Source cleared.
        *   In R2: Source Azure (col 1) maps to Target Blue (col 4-6)? Yes, fits output. Source cleared.

    This combined vertical/horizontal logic seems consistent across both examples!
    1.  Identify horizontal separators (full yellow rows).
    2.  Identify vertical separators (full yellow columns).
    3.  These separators define rectangular zones.
    4.  Within each zone: Identify source objects (non-white/blue/yellow) and target objects (blue).
    5.  Apply mapping:
        *   **Rule A (Intra-Zone):** If a zone contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects, all targets in that zone take the source color. Mark source and targets as mapped.
        *   **Rule B (Inter-Zone, Same Row-Band):** Look at zones within the same horizontal band (between two horizontal separators). If Zone Z1 contains one unmapped source S and Zone Z2 (in the same band) contains one or more unmapped targets T, map S to all T. Mark S and T as mapped. (This seems to fit Example 2).
        *   **Rule C (Inter-Zone, Different Row-Band):** Look at zones across one horizontal separator. If Zone Z_above contains one unmapped source S and Zone Z_below (in the same vertical column band) contains one or more unmapped targets T, map S to all T. Mark S and T as mapped. (This seems to fit Example 1).

    Let's re-evaluate Rule B for Example 2:
    *   Band 0 (rows 0-2): Zone(0,0) has Source Orange. Zone(0,1) has Targets Blue. Map Orange -> Blue.
    *   Band 1 (rows 4-6): Zone(1,0) has Source Green. Zone(1,1) has Targets Blue. Map Green -> Blue.
    *   Band 2 (rows 8-10): Zone(2,0) has Source Azure. Zone(2,1) has Targets Blue. Map Azure -> Blue.
    This fits!

    Let's re-evaluate Rule C for Example 1:
    *   Band 0 (rows 0-2) and Band 1 (rows 4-6) across horizontal separator at row 3.
    *   Column Band 0 (cols 0-2): Zone(0,0) has Source Green. Zone(1,0) has Target Blue. Map Green -> Blue.
    *   Column Band 1 (cols 4-6): Zone(0,1) has Source Red. Zone(1,1) has Target Blue. Map Red -> Blue.
    *   Column Band 2 (cols 8-10): Zone(0,2) has Source Magenta. Zone(1,2) has Target Blue. Map Magenta -> Blue.
    This also fits!

    This revised zone-based logic seems much more robust. The clearing failure in the previous run on Example 2 remains confusing, but perhaps implementing this new logic will resolve it, maybe by changing the order or selection of objects. The core idea remains: apply color to targets, clear sources used in mapping.

**Revised Plan:**

1.  Define Zones: Use horizontal and vertical yellow lines to partition the grid.
2.  Identify Objects per Zone: Find source and target objects within each zone.
3.  Apply Mapping Rules (prioritized):
    *   Intra-Zone (Rule A).
    *   Inter-Zone Same Horizontal Band (Rule B).
    *   Inter-Zone Same Vertical Band (Rule C).
    *   Need to refine priority and conditions (e.g., exactly one source?).
4.  Perform Transformations: Color targets, clear mapped sources.

Let's refine the rules slightly:
Map source S to target(s) T if:
1.  S and T are in the same zone, and it's the only source in that zone.
2.  S is in zone (r, c1), T is in zone (r, c2) (same row band), S is the only source in (r, c1).
3.  S is in zone (r1, c), T is in zone (r2, c) (same col band), r1 and r2 are separated by exactly one horizontal separator, S is the only source in (r1, c).

This seems comprehensive. Let's assume a source can only map once.

Final check on clearing bug: If the new logic correctly identifies the sources and targets for mapping based on zones, the list of sources to clear (`source_pixels_to_clear`) and the list of mappings (`mappings`) should be correct. The application steps (color targets, then clear sources) should work unless there's a very obscure environment issue or Numpy bug. Let's proceed with the new logic and assume the clearing step will work correctly if the inputs to it are right.Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

## General Assessment

The provided code attempted a transformation based on horizontal regions defined by yellow lines. It correctly identified the logic for Example 2 (mapping within horizontal regions where one source colors multiple targets) but failed to clear the source pixels after mapping. It completely failed on Example 1 because the mapping logic (same-region or equal-count cross-region) did not apply.

The key insight missed was the role of **vertical yellow lines** acting as separators alongside horizontal ones. These define distinct zones (rectangular areas bounded by separators or grid edges). The mapping logic appears to operate *between* or *within* these zones.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Zone Identification:** Modify the logic to identify zones based on both horizontal and vertical full yellow lines.
2.  **Object Identification per Zone:** Find source (non-white/blue/yellow) and target (blue) objects within each zone.
3.  **Refined Mapping Logic:** Implement new mapping rules based on zone relationships:
    *   **Intra-Zone:** A single source within a zone maps to all targets within the same zone.
    *   **Inter-Zone (Horizontal):** A single source in zone Z1 maps to all targets in zone Z2 if Z1 and Z2 are in the same row of zones (adjacent horizontally or separated by other zones in the same row-band) and share the same horizontal band (between the same pair of horizontal separators). Prioritize adjacent zones.
    *   **Inter-Zone (Vertical):** A single source in zone Z1 maps to all targets in zone Z2 if Z1 and Z2 are in the same column of zones (adjacent vertically or separated by other zones in the same column-band) and share the same vertical band (between the same pair of vertical separators). Prioritize zones directly above/below each other across a single horizontal separator.
    *   Refine uniqueness constraints (e.g., does the source *have* to be the *only* one in its zone? Does it map if there are multiple targets?) Based on the examples, it seems a single source maps to *all* corresponding targets.
4.  **Transformation:** Apply the determined mappings (color targets) and clear the pixels of the source objects used in the mappings. Address the potential clearing bug noted in Example 2, ensuring the source pixels are set to white (0).

## Metrics Gathering

Based on manual analysis and the `tool_code` output:

*   Input Grid Size: 7x11
*   Horizontal Separators: Row 3
*   Vertical Separators: Columns 3, 7
*   Zones: 6 zones (2 rows x 3 columns)
    *   Zone (0,0): Rows 0-2, Cols 0-2. Contains 1 source (Green).
    *   Zone (0,1): Rows 0-2, Cols 4-6. Contains 1 source (Red).
    *   Zone (0,2): Rows 0-2, Cols 8-10. Contains 1 source (Magenta).
    *   Zone (1,0): Rows 4-6, Cols 0-2. Contains 2 targets (Blue clusters).
    *   Zone (1,1): Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6. Contains 2 targets (Blue clusters).
    *   Zone (1,2): Rows 4-6, Cols 8-10. Contains 2 targets (Blue clusters).
*   Code Result: Failed (No transformation).
*   Reason: Original logic didn't account for vertical separators or vertical mapping across the horizontal separator. The number of sources (3) and targets (6) didn't match for the cross-region rule.

**Example 2:**

*   Input Grid Size: 11x7
*   Horizontal Separators: Rows 3, 7
*   Vertical Separators: Column 3
*   Zones: 6 zones (3 rows x 2 columns)
    *   Zone (0,0): Rows 0-2, Cols 0-2. Contains 1 source (Orange).
    *   Zone (0,1): Rows 0-2, Cols 4-6. Contains 2 targets (Blue clusters).
    *   Zone (1,0): Rows 4-6, Cols 0-2. Contains 1 source (Green).
    *   Zone (1,1): Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6. Contains 1 target (Blue cluster).
    *   Zone (2,0): Rows 8-10, Cols 0-2. Contains 1 source (Azure).
    *   Zone (2,1): Rows 8-10, Cols 4-6. Contains 2 targets (Blue clusters).
*   Code Result: Partially Failed (Correct coloring, failed source clearing).
*   Reason: Original logic correctly identified the same-region mapping (which aligns with the horizontal inter-zone mapping using the new zone definition). The failure to clear source pixels `{(1, 1), (5, 1), (9, 1)}` is likely a bug in the implementation or an interaction issue, as the logic appears sound.

    description: Determine pairings between source objects and target objects based on zone relationships.
    rules:
      - rule: intra_zone_mapping
        condition: A zone contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects.
        effect: The source object maps its color to all target objects in that same zone.
      - rule: inter_zone_horizontal_mapping
        condition: A zone Z_src at (row_band, col_band_1) contains exactly one source object S, and another zone Z_tgt at (row_band, col_band_2) in the same row_band contains one or more target objects T.
        effect: Source S maps its color to all targets T in Z_tgt. (Priority might be needed for multiple sources/targets). Example 2 suggests mapping happens between adjacent columns within the same row band.
      - rule: inter_zone_vertical_mapping
        condition: A zone Z_src at (row_band_1, col_band) contains exactly one source object S, and another zone Z_tgt at (row_band_2, col_band) in the same col_band contains one or more target objects T, where row_band_1 and row_band_2 are separated by exactly one horizontal separator.
        effect: Source S maps its color to all targets T in Z_tgt. Example 1 suggests this mapping.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Grid Structure:**
    *   Find all rows consisting entirely of yellow (4) pixels. These are horizontal separators.
    *   Find all columns consisting entirely of yellow (4) pixels. These are vertical separators.
    *   Use the grid boundaries and these separators to partition the grid into rectangular zones. Assign each zone coordinates (zone_row, zone_col).
2.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Within each zone, identify all distinct contiguous objects.
    *   Classify objects as 'source' if their color is not white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4).
    *   Classify objects as 'target' if their color is blue (1).
    *   Store each object's color, pixels, and the zone it belongs to.
3.  **Determine Mappings:** Create a list of mappings, where each mapping connects one source object to one or more target objects. Apply the following rules in order, ensuring a source object is used only once:
    *   **Rule 1 (Intra-Zone):** For each zone, if it contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects, map that source object to all target objects within that same zone. Mark the source and targets as 'mapped'.
    *   **Rule 2 (Inter-Zone Vertical):** Check pairs of zones (Z_above, Z_below) that are in the same zone column and are directly separated by a single horizontal separator. If Z_above contains exactly one 'unmapped' source object, and Z_below contains one or more 'unmapped' target objects, map the source to all those targets. Mark the source and targets as 'mapped'. (Apply similarly if source is below and targets are above).
    *   **Rule 3 (Inter-Zone Horizontal):** Check pairs of zones (Z_left, Z_right) that are in the same zone row and are directly separated by a single vertical separator. If Z_left contains exactly one 'unmapped' source object, and Z_right contains one or more 'unmapped' target objects, map the source to all those targets. Mark the source and targets as 'mapped'. (Apply similarly if source is right and targets are left).
4.  **Apply Transformation:**
    *   Create a copy of the input grid.
    *   For every determined mapping (source S -> targets T_list): Change the color of all pixels belonging to each target T in T_list to the color of source S in the copied grid.
    *   For every source object S that was marked as 'mapped': Change the color of all pixels belonging to S to white (0) in the copied grid.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**(Self-Correction Note on Clearing Bug):** Assuming the logic above correctly identifies source pixels to be cleared, the implementation must ensure the `output_grid[r, c] = 0` step is effective and not accidentally skipped or overwritten. Double-check loop conditions and variable scopes during coding.
