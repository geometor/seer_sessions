            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the transformation logic based on identifying zones separated by yellow lines, finding 'source' objects (non-white/blue/yellow) and 'target' objects (blue), mapping sources to targets based on zone adjacency, transferring the source color to the targets, and clearing the original source object.\n\nThe execution results show that the code correctly identifies the zones, sources, targets, and performs the color transfer from sources to targets according to the expected logic (intra-zone or adjacent zone mapping). However, in both examples, the final step of clearing the original source objects (changing their pixels to white) failed. The transformed output incorrectly retains the original source objects' colors, while the expected output shows them cleared.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is to ensure the natural language program clearly states that mapped source objects are cleared, and to verify that the implementation correctly executes this step. The existing code *appears* to have the correct logic for clearing the source pixels, suggesting a potential issue in the execution or interpretation rather than a fundamental flaw in the described algorithm. We will proceed assuming the intended logic (clearing mapped sources) is correct, as it aligns with the expected outputs.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe will analyze the differences between the `transformed_output` and `expected_output` for each example.\n\n"

Assign coordinates (zone\\_row, zone\\_col) to each zone based on its position relative to the separators.\n2.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   Within each identified zone, find all contiguous groups of pixels of the same color.\n    *   Classify an object as a 'source' if its color is *not* white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4).\n    *   Classify an object as a 'target' if its color *is* blue (1).\n    *   For each object, record its color, the set of pixel coordinates it occupies, and the zone it belongs to. Add a status flag 'mapped', initialized to false.\n3.  **Determine Mappings:** Establish connections (mappings) between source objects and target objects using the following rules, applied in the order listed. Once an object is part of a successful mapping determined by a rule, mark it as 'mapped' to potentially exclude it from consideration in subsequent rules (depending on rule specifics). Create a list to store the successful mappings, where each entry contains the source object and a list of its corresponding target objects.\n    *   **Rule 1 (Intra-Zone):** For each zone, if it contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects, map that source object to *all* target objects within the *same* zone. Mark the source and all associated targets as 'mapped'.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Inter-Zone Vertical):** Examine pairs of zones that are vertically adjacent (e.g., (Zr, Zc) and (Zr+1, Zc)). If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both possible configurations (source above targets, source below targets). If a mapping is found, mark the involved source and target objects as 'mapped'.\n    *   **Rule 3 (Inter-Zone Horizontal):** Examine pairs of zones that are horizontally adjacent (e.g., (Zr, Zc) and (Zr, Zc+1)). If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both possible configurations (source left of targets, source right of targets). If a mapping is found, mark the involved source and target objects as 'mapped'.\n4.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Create a new grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    *   Iterate through the list of successful mappings established in Step 3. For each mapping (Source S -> Targets T\\_list):\n        *   Change the color of all pixels belonging to each target object T in T\\_list to the color of the source object S in the copied grid.\n    *   Iterate through all source objects identified in Step 2. If a source object S was involved in *any* successful mapping (i.e., it appears as the source in the mappings list), change the color of all pixels originally belonging to S to white (0) in the copied grid. This clearing step occurs *after* all target colors have been updated.\n5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid."
