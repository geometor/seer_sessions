## General Assessment

The provided code attempts to implement the transformation logic based on identifying zones separated by yellow lines, finding 'source' objects (non-white/blue/yellow) and 'target' objects (blue), mapping sources to targets based on zone adjacency, transferring the source color to the targets, and clearing the original source object.

The execution results show that the code correctly identifies the zones, sources, targets, and performs the color transfer from sources to targets according to the expected logic (intra-zone or adjacent zone mapping). However, in both examples, the final step of clearing the original source objects (changing their pixels to white) failed. The transformed output incorrectly retains the original source objects' colors, while the expected output shows them cleared.

The strategy for resolving this is to ensure the natural language program clearly states that mapped source objects are cleared, and to verify that the implementation correctly executes this step. The existing code *appears* to have the correct logic for clearing the source pixels, suggesting a potential issue in the execution or interpretation rather than a fundamental flaw in the described algorithm. We will proceed assuming the intended logic (clearing mapped sources) is correct, as it aligns with the expected outputs.

## Metrics

We will analyze the differences between the `transformed_output` and `expected_output` for each example.

{'pixels_off': 3, 'differences': [{'coords': (np.int64(1), np.int64(1)), 'transformed': 3, 'expected': 0}, {'coords': (np.int64(1), np.int64(5)), 'transformed': 2, 'expected': 0}, {'coords': (np.int64(1), np.int64(9)), 'transformed': 6, 'expected': 0}]}

--- Example 2 Analysis ---

```
The metrics confirm the assessment:
*   In Example 1, the 3 differing pixels are exactly the locations of the original source objects (Green at (1,1), Red at (1,5), Magenta at (1,9)). The transformed output has the original colors (3, 2, 6), while the expected output has white (0).
*   In Example 2, the 3 differing pixels are also the locations of the original source objects (Orange at (1,1), Green at (5,1), Azure at (9,1)). The transformed output has the original colors (7, 3, 8), while the expected output has white (0).

This confirms the only error is the failure to clear the source object pixels after they have been mapped and their color transferred.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Maps colored objects ('sources') to blue objects ('targets') across zones defined by yellow lines, transferring the source color to the targets and removing the original source object.

definitions:
  - name: Separators
    type: Grid Features
    properties:
      - Horizontal separators are rows composed entirely of yellow pixels.
      - Vertical separators are columns composed entirely of yellow pixels.
  - name: Zones
    type: Grid Regions
    properties:
      - Rectangular areas defined by grid boundaries and separators.
      - Each zone has coordinates (zone_row, zone_col).
  - name: Source Objects
    type: Objects
    properties:
      - Contiguous areas of a single color.
      - Color is not white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4).
      - Located within a specific zone.
  - name: Target Objects
    type: Objects
    properties:
      - Contiguous areas of a single color.
      - Color is blue (1).
      - Located within a specific zone.

transformation_steps:
  - step: 1. Identify Grid Structure
    action: Find all horizontal and vertical yellow separators.
    result: Partition the grid into zones.
  - step: 2. Identify Objects
    action: In each zone, find all source objects and target objects.
    details: Store each object's color, pixels, and zone coordinates.
  - step: 3. Determine Mappings
    action: Create mappings from source objects to target objects based on zone relationships, applying rules sequentially and ensuring each object is used in at most one rule category (intra, vertical, horizontal).
    rules:
      - rule_name: Intra-Zone
        condition: A zone contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects.
        mapping: Map the source to all targets within that zone.
      - rule_name: Inter-Zone Vertical
        condition: Two vertically adjacent zones (sharing a horizontal separator) exist where one contains exactly one *unmapped* source and the other contains one or more *unmapped* targets.
        mapping: Map the source to all eligible targets in the adjacent zone. Check both directions (source above/targets below and source below/targets above).
      - rule_name: Inter-Zone Horizontal
        condition: Two horizontally adjacent zones (sharing a vertical separator) exist where one contains exactly one *unmapped* source and the other contains one or more *unmapped* targets.
        mapping: Map the source to all eligible targets in the adjacent zone. Check both directions (source left/targets right and source right/targets left).
    state_change: Mark objects involved in a successful mapping as 'mapped' to prevent reuse in subsequent rules within the same category or later categories if applicable (precise interaction depends on implementation, but the core idea is to prioritize unique mappings).
  - step: 4. Apply Transformation
    action: Modify a copy of the input grid based on the determined mappings.
    sub_actions:
      - action: Color Transfer
        details: For each mapping (Source S -> Targets T_list), change the color of all pixels belonging to each target T in T_list to the color of source S.
      - action: Source Removal
        details: For every source object S that was part of *any* successful mapping in Step 3, change the color of all pixels originally belonging to S to white (0). This happens *after* the color transfer to targets.
  - step: 5. Output
    action: Return the modified grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Grid Structure:**
    *   Locate all rows composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels; these are horizontal separators.
    *   Locate all columns composed entirely of yellow (4) pixels; these are vertical separators.
    *   Use the grid boundaries and these separators to divide the grid into distinct rectangular zones. Assign coordinates (zone\_row, zone\_col) to each zone based on its position relative to the separators.
2.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Within each identified zone, find all contiguous groups of pixels of the same color.
    *   Classify an object as a 'source' if its color is *not* white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4).
    *   Classify an object as a 'target' if its color *is* blue (1).
    *   For each object, record its color, the set of pixel coordinates it occupies, and the zone it belongs to. Add a status flag 'mapped', initialized to false.
3.  **Determine Mappings:** Establish connections (mappings) between source objects and target objects using the following rules, applied in the order listed. Once an object is part of a successful mapping determined by a rule, mark it as 'mapped' to potentially exclude it from consideration in subsequent rules (depending on rule specifics). Create a list to store the successful mappings, where each entry contains the source object and a list of its corresponding target objects.
    *   **Rule 1 (Intra-Zone):** For each zone, if it contains exactly one source object and one or more target objects, map that source object to *all* target objects within the *same* zone. Mark the source and all associated targets as 'mapped'.
    *   **Rule 2 (Inter-Zone Vertical):** Examine pairs of zones that are vertically adjacent (e.g., (Zr, Zc) and (Zr+1, Zc)). If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both possible configurations (source above targets, source below targets). If a mapping is found, mark the involved source and target objects as 'mapped'.
    *   **Rule 3 (Inter-Zone Horizontal):** Examine pairs of zones that are horizontally adjacent (e.g., (Zr, Zc) and (Zr, Zc+1)). If one zone contains exactly one *unmapped* source object and the adjacent zone contains one or more *unmapped* target objects, map the source object to *all* those target objects in the adjacent zone. Perform this check for both possible configurations (source left of targets, source right of targets). If a mapping is found, mark the involved source and target objects as 'mapped'.
4.  **Apply Transformation:**
    *   Create a new grid as a copy of the input grid.
    *   Iterate through the list of successful mappings established in Step 3. For each mapping (Source S -> Targets T\_list):
        *   Change the color of all pixels belonging to each target object T in T\_list to the color of the source object S in the copied grid.
    *   Iterate through all source objects identified in Step 2. If a source object S was involved in *any* successful mapping (i.e., it appears as the source in the mappings list), change the color of all pixels originally belonging to S to white (0) in the copied grid. This clearing step occurs *after* all target colors have been updated.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
