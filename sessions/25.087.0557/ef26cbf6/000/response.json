These yellow lines remain unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Objects:** Within each region (excluding the yellow separators), there are distinct objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same color, set against a white (color 0) background.\n3.  **Key Colors:**\n    *   Yellow (4): Static separators.\n    *   White (0): Static background.\n    *   Blue (1): Represents \"target\" objects whose color will be changed.\n    *   Other colors (2, 3, 6, 7, 8 in examples): Represent \"source\" objects providing the new color for the targets.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation involves changing the color of the blue (1) objects. The new color comes from a \"source\" object. The specific way the source color is determined depends on the arrangement within the regions:\n    *   **Scenario 1 (e.g., `train_2`):** If a region contains both a blue (target) object and exactly one non-blue, non-yellow, non-white (source) object, the blue object's color is changed to the source object's color.\n    *   **Scenario 2 (e.g., `train_1`):** If source objects are in one region and blue (target) objects are in a different region, the colors of the source objects are transferred to the target objects based on their relative horizontal positions (leftmost source color goes to leftmost target, etc.).\n5.  **Source Object Handling:** After a source object's color is used to update a target object, the pixels originally belonging to the source object are changed to white (0) in the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Identify all horizontal lines composed entirely of yellow pixels (color 4). These lines act as separators.\n3.  Define the regions based on these separators. A region is a horizontal slice of the grid located between two separators, above the first separator, or below the last separator.\n4.  Create two lists: `all_source_objects` and `all_target_objects`. Iterate through all regions:\n    a.  Find all contiguous objects of blue color (1) within the current region. Add them to `all_target_objects`, storing their pixel coordinates and region index.\n    b.  Find all contiguous objects of any color other than white (0), blue (1), or yellow (4) within the current region. Add them to `all_source_objects`, storing their pixel coordinates, color, and region index.\n5.  Determine the source-target mapping:\n    a.  Create an empty list `mappings`.\n    b.  First, check for same-region mappings: Iterate through each region index `r`. Find source objects (`region_sources`) and target objects (`region_targets`) belonging to region `r`. If `region_sources` contains exactly one source object and `region_targets` contains one or more target objects, then for each target object in `region_targets`, add a mapping pair (source object's color, target object's pixels) to the `mappings` list. Mark these source and target objects as \"mapped\".\n    c.  Next, check for cross-region mappings: Collect all \"unmapped\" source objects and \"unmapped\" target objects from all regions. If both collections are non-empty:\n        i.  Sort the unmapped source objects based on their horizontal position (e.g., by the minimum column index of their bounding box, from left to right).\n        ii. Sort the unmapped target objects similarly based on their horizontal position.\n        iii. Assuming the number of unmapped sources equals the number of unmapped targets, iterate through the sorted lists. For the k-th source object and the k-th target object, add a mapping pair (k-th source object's color, k-th target object's pixels) to the `mappings` list. Mark these objects as \"mapped\".\n6.  Apply the transformations based on the `mappings`:\n    a.  Iterate through each `(source_color, target_pixels)` pair in the `mappings` list. For every pixel coordinate in `target_pixels`, set the corresponding pixel in the `output_grid` to `source_color`.\n7.  Clear the original source object locations: Iterate through `all_source_objects`. For each source object that was used in a mapping (i.e., marked as \"mapped\" or present in the `mappings`), iterate through its original pixel coordinates. Set the corresponding pixels in the `output_grid` to white (0).\n8.  Return the final `output_grid`."
