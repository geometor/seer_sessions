elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels with colors 0-9.
  - type: separator
    color: 4 (yellow)
    shape: horizontal line
    role: divides the grid into horizontal regions, remains static.
  - type: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: fills empty space, remains static.
  - type: target_object
    color: 1 (blue)
    shape: variable contiguous blocks
    role: receives a new color based on a source object.
  - type: source_object
    color: any color except 0, 1, 4
    shape: variable contiguous blocks
    role: provides the new color for a target object. Original location becomes white (0).
  - type: region
    definition: A horizontal section of the grid bounded by yellow separators or grid edges.
    role: Defines the scope for identifying corresponding source and target objects.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects exist within regions defined by separators.
  - type: mapping
    description: A rule determines which source object's color applies to which target object.
    conditions:
      - if source and target are in the same region: target takes the color of the single source in that region.
      - if source(s) and target(s) are in different regions: colors are mapped based on left-to-right positional order between the set of source objects and the set of target objects.

actions:
  - name: identify_separators
    input: grid
    output: list of row indices containing yellow lines.
  - name: identify_regions
    input: grid, separator indices
    output: list of regions (subgrids or coordinate sets).
  - name: find_objects
    input: region, colors_to_find
    output: list of objects (pixel coordinates, color, bounding box).
  - name: determine_mapping_rule
    input: source objects list, target objects list, region information
    output: mapping pairs (source_color, target_object_pixels).
  - name: apply_color_change
    input: output_grid, target_object_pixels, new_color
    output: modified output_grid.
  - name: clear_source_pixels
    input: output_grid, source_object_pixels
    output: modified output_grid (source pixels set to 0).
