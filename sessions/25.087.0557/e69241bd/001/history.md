Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Color Palette:** The grids use several colors: white (0), blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), and azure (8).
2.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain distinct regions of different colors, including areas of white (0) and boundaries made of gray (5). There are also "source" or "seed" pixels of other colors (blue, green, yellow, magenta, orange, azure) scattered within or near the white areas.
3.  **Output Structure:** The output grids are modified versions of the input grids. The key difference is that many of the white (0) pixels have been replaced by other colors. The positions of the gray (5) pixels and the initial non-white, non-gray pixels remain unchanged.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a type of "flood fill" or "color spreading" process. Colors other than white (0) and gray (5) seem to expand into adjacent white (0) cells.
5.  **Adjacency:** The color spreading considers diagonal adjacency (Moore neighborhood - 8 surrounding cells). A white cell changes color if it's next to (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) a cell with a "spreading" color.
6.  **Barriers:** Gray (5) pixels act as barriers. The color spreading does not cross or change gray pixels. White pixels only adjacent to gray or other white pixels do not change color.
7.  **Source Colors:** The colors that spread are blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), and azure (8). White (0) does not spread. Gray (5) acts as a boundary.
8.  **Propagation:** The spreading seems iterative. A white pixel changes color, and then *it* can cause adjacent white pixels to change color in a subsequent step, until no more white pixels are adjacent to the spreading colors or the spread hits a gray barrier or grid edge.
9.  **Conflict Resolution (Implicit):** The examples do not seem to contain situations where a single white pixel is simultaneously adjacent to two *different* spreading colors. The fill propagates outwards from the initial source pixels.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
Grid Properties:
  - Grid Size: Variable (e.g., 9x9, 7x7)
  - Color Palette: [0: white, 1: blue, 2: red (not used), 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon (not used)]

Objects:
  - Type: Pixels
  - Attributes:
    - Color: Integer (0-9)
    - Position: (row, column)
  - Roles:
    - Background: white (0) pixels
    - Barriers: gray (5) pixels
    - Sources: Pixels with colors other than white (0) and gray (5). Examples include blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (Moore neighborhood).

Actions/Transformations:
  - Type: Conditional Color Change (Flood Fill)
  - Target: white (0) pixels
  - Condition: A white (0) pixel changes color if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to a non-white, non-gray pixel (a "Source" pixel).
  - Result: The white (0) pixel adopts the color of the adjacent Source pixel.
  - Propagation: This process repeats iteratively. Pixels that change color become Sources themselves for subsequent iterations.
  - Termination: The process stops when no more white (0) pixels meet the condition for changing color.
  - Constraints:
    - gray (5) pixels never change color and act as boundaries, preventing color spread across them.
    - Original Source pixels never change color.

Implicit Rules:
  - If a white pixel is adjacent to multiple Source pixels of the *same* color, it takes that color.
  - The examples provided do not explicitly demonstrate the rule for a white pixel adjacent to Source pixels of *different* colors simultaneously. However, the propagation suggests an outward fill from each initial Source.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all "Source" pixels in the input grid: these are pixels whose color is neither white (0) nor gray (5).
3.  Identify all "Barrier" pixels: these are the gray (5) pixels.
4.  Create a list or set of coordinates of pixels that need processing, initially containing the coordinates of all Source pixels.
5.  Start an iterative process that continues as long as changes are being made to the grid in an iteration:
    a.  Keep track of whether any changes were made in the current iteration (e.g., set a flag `changed_in_iteration` to `false`).
    b.  Create a temporary list `pixels_to_change` to store pairs of (coordinate, new_color).
    c.  Iterate through all white (0) pixels in the *current* state of the output grid.
    d.  For each white pixel at `(r, c)`, examine its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood).
    e.  Check if any neighbor `(nr, nc)` contains a Source color (i.e., its color in the current output grid is not white (0) and not gray (5)).
    f.  If one or more neighbors have a Source color:
        i.  Select the color of one such neighbor (based on the examples, if multiple source-colored neighbors exist, they seem to always have the *same* color due to the nature of the outward fill). Let this color be `fill_color`.
        ii. Add the pair `((r, c), fill_color)` to the `pixels_to_change` list.
    g.  After checking all white pixels, iterate through the `pixels_to_change` list. For each pair `((r, c), fill_color)`:
        i.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid is still white (0) (it might have been changed by another source in the same iteration if not handled carefully, though simple iteration order usually suffices), update its color to `fill_color`.
        ii. Set `changed_in_iteration` to `true`.
    h.  If `changed_in_iteration` is `false` after processing all potential changes, break the loop.
6.  Return the final state of the output grid.
