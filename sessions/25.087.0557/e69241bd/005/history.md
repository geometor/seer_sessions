Transformation Rule:

This transformation performs a fill operation on a grid based on proximity to 'source' pixels, respecting 'barrier' pixels.

1.  **Pixel Roles**:
    *   Source Pixels: Colors 1 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), 7 (orange), 8 (azure). These are the colors that spread.
    *   Barrier Pixels: Color 5 (gray). These block the spread of color.
    *   Background Pixels: Color 0 (white). These are the pixels to be potentially filled.

2.  **Filling Logic**:
    *   Each background pixel determines its color based on the nearest source pixel(s).
    *   Distance is measured using Chebyshev distance (max(|dx|, |dy|)), equivalent to the minimum number of steps on the grid including diagonals.
    *   The path for distance calculation cannot pass through barrier pixels.

3.  **Tie-breaking**:
    *   If a background pixel is equidistant from multiple source pixels, it takes the color of the source pixel with the *lowest numerical color value*.

4.  **Unreachable Pixels**:
    *   If a background pixel cannot reach any source pixel due to being surrounded by barriers or if there are no source pixels, it remains a background pixel (color 0).

5.  **Preservation**:
    *   Original source pixels and barrier pixels retain their color in the output grid.

The process involves, for each background pixel, performing a search (like Breadth-First Search) outwards to find the nearest source(s), considering barriers as obstacles, and applying the tie-breaking rule if necessary.
