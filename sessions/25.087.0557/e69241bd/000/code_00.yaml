Grid Properties:
  - Grid Size: Variable (e.g., 9x9, 7x7)
  - Color Palette: [0: white, 1: blue, 2: red (not used), 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon (not used)]

Objects:
  - Type: Pixels
  - Attributes:
    - Color: Integer (0-9)
    - Position: (row, column)
  - Roles:
    - Background: white (0) pixels
    - Barriers: gray (5) pixels
    - Sources: Pixels with colors other than white (0) and gray (5). Examples include blue (1), green (3), yellow (4), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner (Moore neighborhood).

Actions/Transformations:
  - Type: Conditional Color Change (Flood Fill)
  - Target: white (0) pixels
  - Condition: A white (0) pixel changes color if it is adjacent (including diagonally) to a non-white, non-gray pixel (a "Source" pixel).
  - Result: The white (0) pixel adopts the color of the adjacent Source pixel.
  - Propagation: This process repeats iteratively. Pixels that change color become Sources themselves for subsequent iterations.
  - Termination: The process stops when no more white (0) pixels meet the condition for changing color.
  - Constraints:
    - gray (5) pixels never change color and act as boundaries, preventing color spread across them.
    - Original Source pixels never change color.

Implicit Rules:
  - If a white pixel is adjacent to multiple Source pixels of the *same* color, it takes that color.
  - The examples provided do not explicitly demonstrate the rule for a white pixel adjacent to Source pixels of *different* colors simultaneously. However, the propagation suggests an outward fill from each initial Source.
