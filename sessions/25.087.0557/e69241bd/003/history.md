"""
Performs a flood fill operation on a grid.

The transformation identifies specific colors (1: blue, 3: green, 4: yellow, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure) as "source" colors.
These source colors spread iteratively into adjacent white (0) cells, including diagonally adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood).
Gray (5) cells act as barriers and do not change color, nor does the color spread across them.
The process repeats until no more white cells are adjacent to any source-colored cells (either original sources or cells that became colored during the fill).
It assumes that a white cell will not be simultaneously adjacent to two different source colors in a way that creates ambiguity; the first source color found during neighbor checking is used.

**General Assessment**

The previous flood fill algorithm correctly identified the concept of source colors expanding into the white background, blocked by gray barriers. However, it failed significantly on all examples, producing outputs with many incorrect pixels (24, 27, and 8 errors respectively) and often incorrect color counts. The core issue seems to be the rule determining *which* source color fills a given white pixel. The simple iterative fill (where any adjacent source color can claim a white pixel) leads to overly aggressive or incorrect spreading compared to the expected outputs.

Specifically, the transformed outputs often lack the white (0) pixels present in the expected outputs, suggesting the fill spreads too far or into areas it shouldn't. The choice of color also frequently differs (e.g., expected 6, got 8; expected 0, got 6; expected 0, got 3).

The hypothesis that white pixels adopt the color of the *nearest* source pixel seems promising and aligns better with the idea of distinct regions forming. Gray pixels (5) act as barriers, preventing color spread across them.

**Strategy for Resolution**

1.  **Implement Nearest Source Logic**: Modify the algorithm. For each white pixel, calculate the distance (e.g., Manhattan or Chebyshev) to all initial source pixels, considering gray pixels as impassable barriers. Assign the color of the nearest source pixel.
2.  **Handle Ties**: Define a clear tie-breaking rule if a white pixel is equidistant from multiple source pixels. Possibilities:
    *   Lowest color index wins.
    *   Reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of the source pixels wins.
    *   The white pixel remains white (seems less likely based on outputs).
    *   Reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of the *white pixel itself* wins when comparing equidistant sources.
3.  **Refine Distance Calculation**: Ensure the distance metric correctly handles barriers (e.g., using a breadth-first search for pathfinding that avoids gray cells). Chebyshev distance seems appropriate given the diagonal spread seen in the previous attempt (Moore neighborhood).
4.  **Validate**: Test the new logic against all training examples.

**Metrics Analysis**

The code execution provided detailed metrics:

*   **Pixel Errors**: Example 1: 24 errors (70.4% score). Example 2: 27 errors (66.7% score). Example 3: 8 errors (83.7% score). This confirms the previous code was substantially incorrect.
*   **Color Counts**:
    *   Ex 1 & 2: The `transformed` output completely eliminated the background color (0), whereas the `expected` output retained some white pixels. The counts for source colors are significantly different between `expected` and `transformed`. Palette match is `False` because color 0 is missing in transformed.
    *   Ex 3: The `transformed` output nearly eliminated color 0 (only 1 pixel left), while `expected` had 9. Color counts differ. Palette match is `True`, but counts are wrong.
*   **Detailed Differences**: The lists of differing coordinates show where the errors occur.
    *   Ex 1: Errors include `(0,5): (0, 8)`, `(1,0): (0, 6)`, `(4,4): (6, 8)`. This shows white pixels being incorrectly filled (e.g., 0 -> 8, 0 -> 6) and some pixels getting the wrong source color (e.g., 6 -> 8).
    *   Ex 2: Many `(0, X)` errors, where white pixels are filled incorrectly (e.g., `(0,6): (0, 3)`).
    *   Ex 3: Similar pattern, e.g., `(0,0): (0, 4)`, `(2,5): (0, 4)`. Also note `(4,1): (0, 3)` and `(5,2): (0, 3)`, indicating white pixels near the green (3) source were filled incorrectly.

These metrics strongly support the idea that the fill logic is flawed, particularly in how it selects the color for a white pixel when multiple source colors might influence it, and that it fills areas that should remain white. The "nearest source" approach seems the most logical next step.

flow:
  - step: Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  - step: Identify all source pixels, background pixels, and barrier pixels in the input grid.
  - step: For each background pixel (r, c):
      - Find all reachable source pixels (sr, sc) using a pathfinding search (like BFS) that avoids barrier pixels.
      - Calculate the Chebyshev distance `max(abs(r-sr), abs(c-sc))` for each reachable source pixel.
      - Determine the minimum distance found.
      - Identify all source pixels that are at this minimum distance.
      - If no source pixels are reachable, the pixel at (r, c) remains white (0).
      - If one or more source pixels are at the minimum distance, select the one among them with the lowest color value.
      - Assign the selected source color to the output grid at position (r, c).
  - step: Return the modified output grid.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Identify the locations and colors of all "source" pixels (colors 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) in the input grid.
3.  Identify the locations of all "barrier" pixels (color 5) in the input grid.
4.  Identify the locations of all "background" pixels (color 0) in the input grid.
5.  For each background pixel `P` at coordinates `(r, c)`:
    a.  Calculate the shortest path distance from `P` to every source pixel `S`. The pathfinding must treat barrier pixels as impassable obstacles. Use Chebyshev distance (maximum coordinate difference: `max(abs(r_P - r_S), abs(c_P - c_S))`). A Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from `P` can find the shortest path distance to the nearest source(s) while respecting barriers.
    b.  Find the minimum distance (`min_dist`) calculated in step 5a.
    c.  If no source pixel is reachable from `P` (either because `P` is enclosed by barriers or there are no source pixels), the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid remains background color (0).
    d.  If one or more source pixels are reachable, identify all source pixels `S_closest` that are exactly `min_dist` away from `P`.
    e.  From the set `S_closest`, select the source pixel `S_final` that has the *lowest color value*.
    f.  Set the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid to the color of `S_final`.
6.  Pixels that were originally source or barrier pixels retain their original colors in the output grid.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
