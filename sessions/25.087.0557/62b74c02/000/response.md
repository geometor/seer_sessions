Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids (2D arrays) of pixels represented by integer color codes. The grids in the examples have varying widths but consistent heights within each example pair.
2.  **Key Objects:**
    *   There's a distinct, multi-colored, rectangular object always located at the top-left corner of the input grid. Its height matches the grid height.
    *   The rest of the input grid, to the right of this object, is filled with white pixels (color 0).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation primarily involves filling the white area in the input grid. The original non-white object from the input is preserved in the same location in the output. The way the white area is filled seems directly dependent on the structure and colors of the initial object.
4.  **Fill Pattern:** The fill pattern isn't a simple repetition or flood fill. It specifically uses columns derived from the initial object. Observing the examples:
    *   The fill pattern seems to be constructed by repeating the *first column* of the initial object multiple times, followed by appending the *remaining columns* (from the second column to the last column) of the initial object.
    *   The number of repetitions of the first column is determined by the available space (total grid width minus the width of the initial object) and the number of columns appended from the object (object width minus 1).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers (colors).
    - Grid dimensions vary across examples but are consistent within a pair (input height = output height, input width = output width).
  objects:
    - name: source_object
      description: A contiguous, non-white, rectangular block of pixels located at the top-left corner of the input grid. Its height spans the full grid height.
      properties:
        - color: Varies, can be multi-colored.
        - shape: Rectangular.
        - location: Top-left corner (column index 0).
        - width: W (variable across examples).
        - height: H (matches grid height).
    - name: background
      description: The area of the input grid not occupied by the source_object.
      properties:
        - color: white (0).
        - location: To the right of the source_object (columns W to W_total - 1).
  transformation:
    - type: Fill
    - target: The white background area.
    - rule: Based on the columns of the source_object.
  relationships:
    - The output grid preserves the source_object in its original position.
    - The fill pattern in the output's background area is derived from the columns of the source_object.
  pattern_details:
    - The fill pattern consists of two parts:
        1. Repetitions of the first column (C0) of the source_object.
        2. The sequence of the remaining columns (C1 to C(W-1)) of the source_object.
    - Let W be the width of the source_object.
    - Let W_total be the total width of the grid.
    - The width of the area to fill is W_fill = W_total - W.
    - The width of the appended columns sequence is W_app = W - 1.
    - The number of repetitions (N) of the first column (C0) is N = W_fill - W_app.
    - The final fill pattern is constructed column-wise as: [C0] * N + [C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)].

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the non-white rectangular object (`source_object`) located at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Measure** the width (`W`) of the `source_object` and the total width (`W_total`) of the input grid.
3.  **Initialize** the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
4.  **Extract** the columns of the `source_object`. Let these be `C0, C1, ..., C(W-1)`.
5.  **Calculate** the width of the area to be filled: `W_fill = W_total - W`.
6.  **Calculate** the width of the sequence of columns to append from the `source_object` (excluding the first): `W_app = W - 1`.
7.  **Calculate** the required number of repetitions (`N`) for the first column (`C0`): `N = W_fill - W_app`.
8.  **Construct** the fill pattern column by column:
    *   Start with `N` copies of column `C0`.
    *   Append columns `C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)` to the sequence.
9.  **Place** the constructed fill pattern into the output grid, starting at column index `W` and extending to the right edge of the grid. Each column of the fill pattern replaces the corresponding column of white pixels in the initialized output grid.
