The grids in the examples have varying widths but consistent heights within each example pair.\n2.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   There's a distinct, multi-colored, rectangular object always located at the top-left corner of the input grid. Its height matches the grid height.\n    *   The rest of the input grid, to the right of this object, is filled with white pixels (color 0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation primarily involves filling the white area in the input grid. The original non-white object from the input is preserved in the same location in the output. The way the white area is filled seems directly dependent on the structure and colors of the initial object.\n4.  **Fill Pattern:** The fill pattern isn't a simple repetition or flood fill. It specifically uses columns derived from the initial object. Observing the examples:\n    *   The fill pattern seems to be constructed by repeating the *first column* of the initial object multiple times, followed by appending the *remaining columns* (from the second column to the last column) of the initial object.\n    *   The number of repetitions of the first column is determined by the available space (total grid width minus the width of the initial object) and the number of columns appended from the object (object width minus 1).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
