task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers (colors).
    - Grid dimensions vary across examples but are consistent within a pair (input height = output height, input width = output width).
  objects:
    - name: source_object
      description: A contiguous, non-white, rectangular block of pixels located at the top-left corner of the input grid. Its height spans the full grid height.
      properties:
        - color: Varies, can be multi-colored.
        - shape: Rectangular.
        - location: Top-left corner (column index 0).
        - width: W (variable across examples).
        - height: H (matches grid height).
    - name: background
      description: The area of the input grid not occupied by the source_object.
      properties:
        - color: white (0).
        - location: To the right of the source_object (columns W to W_total - 1).
  transformation:
    - type: Fill
    - target: The white background area.
    - rule: Based on the columns of the source_object.
  relationships:
    - The output grid preserves the source_object in its original position.
    - The fill pattern in the output's background area is derived from the columns of the source_object.
  pattern_details:
    - The fill pattern consists of two parts:
        1. Repetitions of the first column (C0) of the source_object.
        2. The sequence of the remaining columns (C1 to C(W-1)) of the source_object.
    - Let W be the width of the source_object.
    - Let W_total be the total width of the grid.
    - The width of the area to fill is W_fill = W_total - W.
    - The width of the appended columns sequence is W_app = W - 1.
    - The number of repetitions (N) of the first column (C0) is N = W_fill - W_app.
    - The final fill pattern is constructed column-wise as: [C0] * N + [C1, C2, ..., C(W-1)].
