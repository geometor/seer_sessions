There is always a single horizontal line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are consistently 2x2 in size.\n3.  **Color Transformation:** The output grid is always filled with a single uniform color, which is either red (2) or yellow (4).\n4.  **Core Logic:** The color chosen for the output grid appears to depend on the relative frequency of red (2) and yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.\n5.  **Counting:** By counting the occurrences of red and yellow pixels in each input example:\n    *   `train_1`: Red=2, Yellow=6. Output is Yellow. (Yellow > Red)\n    *   `train_2`: Red=5, Yellow=4. Output is Red. (Red > Yellow)\n    *   `train_3`: Red=5, Yellow=5. Output is Red. (Red == Yellow)\n    *   `train_4`: Red=5, Yellow=3. Output is Red. (Red > Yellow)\n6.  **Rule Inference:** The output color is determined by which color, red or yellow, appears more often in the input. In case of a tie, red is chosen. The gray line and white background pixels seem irrelevant to determining the output color.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
