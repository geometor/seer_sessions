    description: A 2D grid of pixels with varying dimensions.
    contains:
      - object: red_pixels
        color: 2 (red)
        count: Variable across examples.
      - object: yellow_pixels
        color: 4 (yellow)
        count: Variable across examples.
      - object: gray_line
        color: 5 (gray)
        structure: A single complete horizontal line.
        relevance: Appears irrelevant to the output color determination.
      - object: background_pixels
        color: 0 (white)
        relevance: Appears irrelevant.
  - name: output_grid
    description: A 2D grid of pixels, always 2x2 in size.
    properties:
      - size: 2x2
      - content: Filled entirely with a single color (either red or yellow).

transformation:
  - action: count_pixels
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      - color_to_count: 2 (red)
      - color_to_count: 4 (yellow)
    output:
      - name: red_count
      - name: yellow_count
  - action: compare_counts
    input:
      - red_count
      - yellow_count
    logic: Determine which count is greater or if they are equal.
    output:
      - name: dominant_color
        value: |
          if red_count >= yellow_count, dominant_color is 2 (red).
          if yellow_count > red_count, dominant_color is 4 (yellow).
  - action: construct_output
    input: dominant_color
    result: Create a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the dominant_color.
