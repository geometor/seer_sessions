```python
import numpy as np

"""
This program determines the dominant color between red (2) and yellow (4) in an 
input grid and creates a 2x2 output grid filled with that dominant color. 
The dominance rule is: Red wins if its count is greater than or equal to Yellow's count. 
Yellow wins only if its count is strictly greater than Red's count.
"""

    Transforms the input grid based on the count of red and yellow pixels.

        np.ndarray: A 2x2 numpy array filled with the dominant color (red or yellow).
