1. Find the horizontal line composed entirely of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This line divides the grid into an upper and a lower section.
2. Consider only the section of the grid *below* the gray line.
3. Count the number of red (2) pixels in this lower section (call this count `red_count_below`).
4. Count the number of yellow (4) pixels in this lower section (call this count `yellow_count_below`).
5. Determine the output color based on the difference between these counts:
    a. If `yellow_count_below` minus `red_count_below` is greater than 1, the output color is yellow (4).
    b. Otherwise (if the difference is 1, 0, or negative), the output color is red (2).
6. Create the output grid as a 2x2 grid filled entirely with the determined output color.
