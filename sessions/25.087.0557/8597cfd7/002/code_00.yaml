observations:
  input_grid:
    description: A 2D grid containing pixels of various colors, primarily white (0), red (2), yellow (4), and gray (5).
    objects:
      - type: horizontal_line
        color: gray (5)
        properties: Spans the width of the grid, divides the grid into an upper and lower section.
      - type: pixel_group
        color: red (2)
        properties: Located both above and below the gray line.
      - type: pixel_group
        color: yellow (4)
        properties: Located both above and below the gray line.
      - type: background
        color: white (0)
  output_grid:
    description: A 2x2 grid filled uniformly with a single color.
    properties:
      size: 2x2
      content: Filled entirely with either red (2) or yellow (4).
  transformation:
    description: The color filling the output grid depends on the relative counts of red and yellow pixels located *below* the gray horizontal line in the input grid.
    rule:
      - action: locate the horizontal gray line (color 5).
      - action: identify the region below the gray line.
      - action: count the number of red pixels (color 2) in the region below the gray line (let this be `R_below`).
      - action: count the number of yellow pixels (color 4) in the region below the gray line (let this be `Y_below`).
      - condition: If `Y_below - R_below > 1`:
          - result: The output grid color is yellow (4).
      - condition: Otherwise (if `Y_below - R_below <= 1`):
          - result: The output grid color is red (2).
      - action: create a 2x2 grid filled with the determined result color.
