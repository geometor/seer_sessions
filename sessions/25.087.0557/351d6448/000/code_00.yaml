task_context:
  description: Identify a sequence of objects presented in sections separated by gray lines, determine the rule governing the change between sequential objects, extrapolate the next object in the sequence, and output this single extrapolated object in a minimal 3-row grid.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: 0 (white)
    - separator_color: 5 (gray)
    - separator_orientation: horizontal lines
    - output_dimensions: fixed height of 3 rows, width matches input width.

objects:
  - name: primary_object
    description: A contiguous horizontal sequence of non-background, non-separator pixels found within a single row in each section of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color_pattern: The sequence of colors forming the object (e.g., [2, 2, 3] or [1, 1, ...]).
      - starting_column: The column index where the object begins.
      - length: The number of pixels composing the object horizontally.
      - row_index: The row where the object resides within the input.

relationships:
  - type: sequence
    description: The primary objects form a sequence from top to bottom, corresponding to the sections separated by gray lines.
  - type: pattern_of_change
    description: Properties of the primary objects (e.g., starting_column, length) change predictably from one object to the next in the sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_sections
    inputs: [input_grid]
    outputs: [list_of_section_boundaries]
    description: Locate the row indices of the horizontal gray (5) lines.
  - name: extract_objects
    inputs: [input_grid, list_of_section_boundaries]
    outputs: [list_of_primary_objects_with_properties]
    description: Find the primary object within each section and record its properties (color_pattern, starting_column, length, row_index).
  - name: determine_pattern
    inputs: [list_of_primary_objects_with_properties]
    outputs: [transformation_rule]
    description: Analyze the changes in properties between consecutive objects in the list to find the rule (e.g., "increment starting_column by 1", "increment length by 2").
  - name: extrapolate_next_object
    inputs: [last_object_properties, transformation_rule]
    outputs: [next_object_properties]
    description: Apply the transformation rule to the properties of the last object in the sequence to predict the properties of the next object.
  - name: generate_output_grid
    inputs: [next_object_properties, input_grid_width]
    outputs: [output_grid]
    description: Create a 3-row grid of the same width as the input, filled with the background color (0). Place the extrapolated object (using its predicted properties) into the middle row (row index 1).

final_output:
  - source: generate_output_grid
  - description: The 3xW grid containing only the extrapolated next object in the sequence.
