The left part of the output grid is identical to the input grid. The right part of the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). In the right half of the output grid, the colors seem to be derived from the input grid based on a specific rule.\n3.  **Pixel Mapping:** Comparing the input grid to the right half of the output grid, it appears that:\n    *   Input white pixels (0) become azure pixels (8) in the right half of the output.\n    *   Input red pixels (2) become white pixels (0) in the right half of the output.\n    *   Other colors (if present) seem unchanged, though only white and red appear in the examples.\n4.  **Concatenation:** The final output is formed by placing the original input grid to the left and the transformed grid (derived from the input) to the right. The height of the output grid is the same as the input grid, and the width is exactly double the input grid's width.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
