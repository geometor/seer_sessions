**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The output grid appears to be a horizontal concatenation of two grids. The left part of the output grid is identical to the input grid. The right part of the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Color Transformation:** The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). In the right half of the output grid, the colors seem to be derived from the input grid based on a specific rule.
3.  **Pixel Mapping:** Comparing the input grid to the right half of the output grid, it appears that:
    *   Input white pixels (0) become azure pixels (8) in the right half of the output.
    *   Input red pixels (2) become white pixels (0) in the right half of the output.
    *   Other colors (if present) seem unchanged, though only white and red appear in the examples.
4.  **Concatenation:** The final output is formed by placing the original input grid to the left and the transformed grid (derived from the input) to the right. The height of the output grid is the same as the input grid, and the width is exactly double the input grid's width.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      description: The initial grid provided in the example.
      properties:
        colors_present: [white, red] # Based on examples
        variable_size: true
  - modified_grid:
      type: grid
      description: A grid derived from the input grid with the same dimensions.
      creation_rule:
        - description: Create a copy of the input grid.
        - description: Iterate through each pixel of the copy.
        - condition: If pixel color is white (0).
          action: Change pixel color to azure (8).
        - condition: If pixel color is red (2).
          action: Change pixel color to white (0).
        - condition: Otherwise.
          action: Keep the original pixel color. # Though not observed in examples
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      description: The final grid produced by the transformation.
      properties:
        height: Same as input_grid height.
        width: Double the input_grid width.
      relationship: Horizontal concatenation of input_grid (left) and modified_grid (right).
actions:
  - pixel_replacement:
      input: input_grid pixel
      output: modified_grid pixel
      rules:
        - input_color: white (0)
          output_color: azure (8)
        - input_color: red (2)
          output_color: white (0)
  - grid_concatenation:
      input: [input_grid, modified_grid]
      output: output_grid
      axis: horizontal
      order: [input_grid, modified_grid]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid. Call this the `modified_grid`.
2.  For every pixel in the `modified_grid`:
    *   If the pixel's color is white (0), change its color to azure (8).
    *   If the pixel's color is red (2), change its color to white (0).
3.  Construct the output grid by concatenating the original input grid and the `modified_grid` horizontally. The original input grid should be on the left, and the `modified_grid` should be on the right.
