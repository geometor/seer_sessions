task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      description: The initial grid provided in the example.
      properties:
        colors_present: [white, red] # Based on examples
        variable_size: true
  - modified_grid:
      type: grid
      description: A grid derived from the input grid with the same dimensions.
      creation_rule:
        - description: Create a copy of the input grid.
        - description: Iterate through each pixel of the copy.
        - condition: If pixel color is white (0).
          action: Change pixel color to azure (8).
        - condition: If pixel color is red (2).
          action: Change pixel color to white (0).
        - condition: Otherwise.
          action: Keep the original pixel color. # Though not observed in examples
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      description: The final grid produced by the transformation.
      properties:
        height: Same as input_grid height.
        width: Double the input_grid width.
      relationship: Horizontal concatenation of input_grid (left) and modified_grid (right).
actions:
  - pixel_replacement:
      input: input_grid pixel
      output: modified_grid pixel
      rules:
        - input_color: white (0)
          output_color: azure (8)
        - input_color: red (2)
          output_color: white (0)
  - grid_concatenation:
      input: [input_grid, modified_grid]
      output: output_grid
      axis: horizontal
      order: [input_grid, modified_grid]
