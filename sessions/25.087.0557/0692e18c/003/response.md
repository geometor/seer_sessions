"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a conditional tiling rule using the input grid itself as the tile or stamp.

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (Height_in, Width_in).
2.  Define a scaling factor (SF=3). Note that for this specific task, the input grid dimensions (3x3) happen to match the scaling factor.
3.  Calculate the output grid dimensions (Height_out, Width_out) by multiplying the input dimensions by the scaling factor SF (Height_out = Height_in * SF, Width_out = Width_in * SF).
4.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
5.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (Height_out, Width_out), initialized entirely with the background color.
6.  Iterate through each cell (r_in, c_in) of the input grid.
7.  If the input cell input_grid[r_in][c_in] contains a non-background color:
    a.  Locate the corresponding target SFxSF (3x3) subgrid region in the output grid, starting at row r_in * SF and column c_in * SF.
    b.  Copy the *entire original input grid* into this target SFxSF subgrid region. The dimensions of the input grid (Height_in, Width_in) must match the scaling factor SF for this specific copy operation.
8.  If the input cell contains the background color, the corresponding SFxSF subgrid in the output remains filled with the background color.
9.  Return the completed output grid.
