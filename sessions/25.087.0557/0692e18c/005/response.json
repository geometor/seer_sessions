Determine the dimensions of the input grid (Height_in, Width_in).\n2. Define a scaling factor (SF), which is 3 for this task. All example inputs are 3x3, matching this factor.\n3. Calculate the output grid dimensions (Height_out, Width_out) by multiplying the input dimensions by the scaling factor SF (Height_out = Height_in * SF, Width_out = Width_in * SF).\n4. Identify the background color (white, 0).\n5. Create a new output grid with dimensions (Height_out, Width_out), initialized entirely with the background color.\n6. Iterate through each cell (r_in, c_in) of the input grid.\n7. If the input cell input_grid[r_in][c_in] contains a non-background color:\n    a. Locate the top-left corner of the target SFxSF (3x3) subgrid region in the output grid, which is at row (r_in * SF) and column (c_in * SF).\n    b. Copy the *entire original input grid* (which acts as a stamp) into this target SFxSF subgrid region starting at the calculated top-left corner.\n8. If the input cell contains the background color, the corresponding SFxSF subgrid in the output remains filled with the background color (as initialized).\n9. Return the completed output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a conditional tiling transformation using the input grid as a stamp.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a 2D list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input list of lists to a NumPy array for easier processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # 1.
