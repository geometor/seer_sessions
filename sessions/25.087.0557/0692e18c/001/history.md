## Perception

1.  **Grid Sizes**: All input grids are 3x3. All output grids are 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 (9/3 = 3).
2.  **Color Usage**: Each example uses only two colors: white (0) as a background and one other distinct color (orange, magenta, yellow).
3.  **Output Structure**: The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 subgrids.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The content of each 3x3 subgrid in the output depends on the corresponding cell in the 3x3 input grid.
    *   If the input cell `(r, c)` contains the non-white color, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output (located at rows `r*3` to `r*3+2` and columns `c*3` to `c*3+2`) is filled with a *copy of the entire original 3x3 input grid*.
    *   If the input cell `(r, c)` contains the white color (0), the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output is filled entirely with white (0).
5.  **Object Replication**: The original input grid pattern acts as a "stamp" or "tile". This stamp is placed in the output grid multiple times, specifically in locations corresponding to the non-white pixels of the input grid itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (Height_in, Width_in) and the output grid (Height_out, Width_out). Confirm that Height_out = Height_in * 3 and Width_out = Width_in * 3. Let the scaling factor SF be 3.
2.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
3.  Create a new output grid with the dimensions (Height_out, Width_out), initialized entirely with the background color (white, 0).
4.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to Height_in - 1) and column index `c` (from 0 to Width_in - 1).
5.  For each input cell `input[r][c]`:
    a.  Check if the color of the cell `input[r][c]` is the background color (white).
    b.  If the color is *not* the background color:
        i.   Define the target subgrid region in the output grid. This region starts at row `r * SF` and column `c * SF`, and has dimensions `SF x SF` (which is 3x3 in this case).
        ii.  Copy the *entire original input grid* into this target subgrid region of the output grid.
    c.  If the color *is* the background color, do nothing (the corresponding subgrid in the output remains filled with the background color as initialized).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
