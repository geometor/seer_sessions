"""
Transforms an input grid into an output grid based on a conditional tiling rule.

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (Height_in, Width_in).
2.  Calculate the output grid dimensions (Height_out, Width_out) by multiplying the input dimensions by a scaling factor (SF=3).
3.  Identify the background color (white, 0).
4.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (Height_out, Width_out), initialized entirely with the background color.
5.  Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the input grid.
6.  If the input cell input_grid[r][c] contains a non-background color:
    a.  Locate the corresponding 3x3 subgrid region in the output grid, starting at row r * SF and column c * SF.
    b.  Copy the *entire original input grid* into this 3x3 subgrid region.
7.  If the input cell contains the background color, the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the output remains filled with the background color.
8.  Return the completed output grid.
