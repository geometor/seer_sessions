They are visually divided into three sections by a single horizontal line of orange pixels (color 7) located at the 7th row (index 6).\n2.  **Top Section:** The section above the orange line (rows 0-5) is a 6x4 grid containing only red (color 2) and white (color 0) pixels.\n3.  **Bottom Section:** The section below the orange line (rows 7-12) is also a 6x4 grid containing only magenta (color 6) and white (color 0) pixels.\n4.  **Separator:** The orange line (color 7) acts purely as a separator between the top and bottom sections. It does not appear in the output.\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are always 6x4, matching the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input grid. They contain only azure (color 8) and white (color 0) pixels.\n6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation appears to involve a pixel-wise comparison between the top and bottom sections of the input grid. An azure pixel appears in the output grid only at positions where *both* the corresponding pixel in the top section *and* the corresponding pixel in the bottom section are white. Otherwise, the output pixel is white.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

This line separates the grid into two main parts.\n2.  Extract the subgrid located above the orange line (rows 0 through 5). Call this the `top_grid`. It will be 6 rows high and 4 columns wide.\n3.  Extract the subgrid located below the orange line (rows 7 through 12). Call this the `bottom_grid`. It will also be 6 rows high and 4 columns wide.\n4.  Create a new empty grid, the `output_grid`, with the same dimensions as the `top_grid` and `bottom_grid` (6 rows, 4 columns). Initialize all its pixels to white (color 0).\n5.  Iterate through each pixel position `(row, column)` within the dimensions of the `top_grid` (from row 0 to 5, and column 0 to 3).\n6.  For the current `(row, column)`:\n    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `top_grid`.\n    b.  Check the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `bottom_grid`.\n    c.  If the pixel in `top_grid` is white (0) AND the pixel in `bottom_grid` is white (0), set the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).\n    d.  Otherwise (if either pixel is not white), leave the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `output_grid` as white (0).\n7.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation."
