task_description: Processes a 13x4 input grid divided into two 6x4 sections by an orange line, producing a 6x4 output grid based on a pixel-wise comparison of the input sections.

input_grid:
  height: 13
  width: 4
  sections:
    - name: top
      rows: 0-5
      height: 6
      width: 4
      colors_present: [red (2), white (0)]
    - name: separator
      rows: 6
      height: 1
      width: 4
      colors_present: [orange (7)]
    - name: bottom
      rows: 7-12
      height: 6
      width: 4
      colors_present: [magenta (6), white (0)]

output_grid:
  height: 6
  width: 4
  colors_present: [azure (8), white (0)]

transformation_rule:
  type: pixel-wise comparison
  input_sections_involved: [top, bottom]
  output_grid_dimensions: same as input sections (6x4)
  pixel_logic:
    - condition: Pixel at (r, c) in 'top' section is white (0) AND Pixel at (r, c) in 'bottom' section is white (0).
      output_pixel_value: azure (8)
    - condition: Otherwise.
      output_pixel_value: white (0)
  notes: The row index 'r' for the bottom section comparison needs to be adjusted (input_row = r + 7). The separator line is ignored in the output.
