**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have a height of 13 and a width of 4. They are visually divided into three sections by a single horizontal line of orange pixels (color 7) located at the 7th row (index 6).
2.  **Top Section:** The section above the orange line (rows 0-5) is a 6x4 grid containing only red (color 2) and white (color 0) pixels.
3.  **Bottom Section:** The section below the orange line (rows 7-12) is also a 6x4 grid containing only magenta (color 6) and white (color 0) pixels.
4.  **Separator:** The orange line (color 7) acts purely as a separator between the top and bottom sections. It does not appear in the output.
5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are always 6x4, matching the dimensions of the top and bottom sections of the input grid. They contain only azure (color 8) and white (color 0) pixels.
6.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation appears to involve a pixel-wise comparison between the top and bottom sections of the input grid. An azure pixel appears in the output grid only at positions where *both* the corresponding pixel in the top section *and* the corresponding pixel in the bottom section are white. Otherwise, the output pixel is white.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Processes a 13x4 input grid divided into two 6x4 sections by an orange line, producing a 6x4 output grid based on a pixel-wise comparison of the input sections.

input_grid:
  height: 13
  width: 4
  sections:
    - name: top
      rows: 0-5
      height: 6
      width: 4
      colors_present: [red (2), white (0)]
    - name: separator
      rows: 6
      height: 1
      width: 4
      colors_present: [orange (7)]
    - name: bottom
      rows: 7-12
      height: 6
      width: 4
      colors_present: [magenta (6), white (0)]

output_grid:
  height: 6
  width: 4
  colors_present: [azure (8), white (0)]

transformation_rule:
  type: pixel-wise comparison
  input_sections_involved: [top, bottom]
  output_grid_dimensions: same as input sections (6x4)
  pixel_logic:
    - condition: Pixel at (r, c) in 'top' section is white (0) AND Pixel at (r, c) in 'bottom' section is white (0).
      output_pixel_value: azure (8)
    - condition: Otherwise.
      output_pixel_value: white (0)
  notes: The row index 'r' for the bottom section comparison needs to be adjusted (input_row = r + 7). The separator line is ignored in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the row containing the horizontal line of orange pixels (color 7) in the input grid. This line separates the grid into two main parts.
2.  Extract the subgrid located above the orange line (rows 0 through 5). Call this the `top_grid`. It will be 6 rows high and 4 columns wide.
3.  Extract the subgrid located below the orange line (rows 7 through 12). Call this the `bottom_grid`. It will also be 6 rows high and 4 columns wide.
4.  Create a new empty grid, the `output_grid`, with the same dimensions as the `top_grid` and `bottom_grid` (6 rows, 4 columns). Initialize all its pixels to white (color 0).
5.  Iterate through each pixel position `(row, column)` within the dimensions of the `top_grid` (from row 0 to 5, and column 0 to 3).
6.  For the current `(row, column)`:
    a.  Check the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `top_grid`.
    b.  Check the color of the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `bottom_grid`.
    c.  If the pixel in `top_grid` is white (0) AND the pixel in `bottom_grid` is white (0), set the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `output_grid` to azure (8).
    d.  Otherwise (if either pixel is not white), leave the pixel at `(row, column)` in the `output_grid` as white (0).
7.  The final `output_grid` is the result of the transformation.
