*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output grids are both 3 rows high. The width is consistently 9 columns in the examples.
    *   The input grids contain only 'white' (0) and 'gray' (5) pixels.
    *   The output grids contain blocks of solid colors, different from the input colors.
    *   Visually, both input and output grids appear to be composed of three distinct 3x3 sections arranged horizontally.
    *   Within each 3x3 section of the input, the 'gray' pixels form a specific pattern against a 'white' background.
    *   Each corresponding 3x3 section in the output is filled entirely with a single color.
    *   The color used to fill an output section seems determined solely by the pattern of 'gray' pixels in the corresponding input section. The position of the section (left, middle, right) does not appear to influence the color choice itself, only which pattern is being considered.
    *   There is a consistent mapping between specific 3x3 gray patterns in the input and the resulting solid color in the output across all provided examples.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Divide the input grid horizontally into three equal 3x3 subgrids (columns 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8).
    2.  For each 3x3 input subgrid:
        a.  Examine the pattern formed by the 'gray' (5) pixels within that subgrid.
        b.  Determine the output color associated with this specific 3x3 pattern based on a predefined mapping rule (e.g., 'O' pattern maps to 'green', 'center dot' maps to 'yellow', 'diagonal' maps to 'maroon', 'bottom line' maps to 'blue', 'left line' maps to 'magenta').
        c.  Record the determined output color for this segment.
    3.  Construct the output grid, which has the same 3x9 dimensions as the input.
    4.  Fill the first 3x3 section (columns 0-2) of the output grid entirely with the color determined in step 2b for the first input subgrid.
    5.  Fill the second 3x3 section (columns 3-5) of the output grid entirely with the color determined in step 2b for the second input subgrid.
    6.  Fill the third 3x3 section (columns 6-8) of the output grid entirely with the color determined in step 2b for the third input subgrid.
