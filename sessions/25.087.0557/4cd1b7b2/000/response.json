            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 4x4 grids. The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The input grids use colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and white (0). The output grids only use colors blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). White (0) is systematically replaced.\n3.  **Pixel Preservation:** Pixels that are not white (0) in the input grid retain their color and position in the output grid.\n4.  **White Pixel Replacement:** White pixels (0) in the input grid are replaced by one of the colors {1, 2, 3, 4} in the output grid.\n5.  **Row Constraint:** Observing the output grids, each row contains exactly one instance of each color from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. This resembles a Sudoku-like constraint applied row-wise.\n6.  **Filling Logic:** The specific color used to replace a white pixel depends on which colors from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} are already present in that row in the input grid. The white pixels are filled with the \"missing\" colors for that row.\n7.  **Assignment Order (Multiple Whites):** When a row contains multiple white pixels, there's a specific rule for assigning the multiple missing colors:\n    *   Identify the missing colors (from {1, 2, 3, 4}) and sort them ascendingly.\n    *   Identify the column indices of the white pixels and sort them ascendingly.\n    *   If the row index (0-based) is **odd**, assign the *ascendingly* sorted missing colors to the *ascendingly* sorted white pixel indices.\n    *   If the row index (0-based) is **even**, assign the *descendingly* sorted missing colors to the *ascendingly* sorted white pixel indices.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
