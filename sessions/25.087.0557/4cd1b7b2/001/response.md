```python
"""
Processes a 4x4 grid. Non-white pixels are preserved. White pixels (0) in each row are replaced by the colors from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} that are missing from that row. The assignment order depends on the row index: for even rows, missing colors (sorted descendingly) are assigned to white pixel positions (sorted ascendingly); for odd rows, missing colors (sorted ascendingly) are assigned to white pixel positions (sorted ascendingly).
