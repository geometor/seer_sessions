Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9).
2.  **Dimensionality Change:** In all examples, the output grid is exactly twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. If the input is HxW, the output is (2H)x(2W).
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The output grid appears to be constructed by arranging four transformed versions of the input grid into a 2x2 layout.
4.  **Transformations Identified:**
    *   The bottom-right quadrant of the output seems to be an exact copy of the input grid.
    *   The top-right quadrant seems to be the input grid flipped vertically (upside-down).
    *   The bottom-left quadrant seems to be the input grid flipped horizontally (left-right mirror).
    *   The top-left quadrant seems to be the input grid rotated 180 degrees (which is equivalent to flipping both vertically and horizontally).

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions (2 * H) by (2 * W).
3.  Generate four transformed versions of the input grid:
    a.  `rotated_180`: Rotate the input grid by 180 degrees.
    b.  `flipped_vertical`: Flip the input grid vertically.
    c.  `flipped_horizontal`: Flip the input grid horizontally.
    d.  `original`: Use the input grid as is.
4.  Assemble the output grid by placing these transformed grids into the four quadrants:
    a.  Place `rotated_180` into the top-left quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    b.  Place `flipped_vertical` into the top-right quadrant (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
    c.  Place `flipped_horizontal` into the bottom-left quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
    d.  Place `original` into the bottom-right quadrant (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1).
5.  The assembled grid is the final output.
