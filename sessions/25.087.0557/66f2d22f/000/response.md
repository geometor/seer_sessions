Okay, let's analyze the provided ARC task examples.

## Perception

1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 4 rows by 14 columns. The output grids are consistently 4 rows by 7 columns. The output width is exactly half the input width.
2.  **Color Palette:**
    *   Input grids use White (0), Green (3), and Red (2).
    *   Output grids use White (0) and Gray (5).
3.  **Input Structure:** The input grid appears structurally divided into two halves: a left half (columns 0-6) and a right half (columns 7-13). The left half predominantly features Green (3) pixels mixed with White (0), while the right half features Red (2) pixels mixed with White (0).
4.  **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve comparing corresponding pixels from the left and right halves of the input grid to determine the pixel value in the output grid.
5.  **Rule Identification:** By comparing input pixel pairs `(row, col)` and `(row, col + 7)` with the output pixel `(row, col)`:
    *   If *both* the input pixel from the left half (`input[row][col]`) and the corresponding input pixel from the right half (`input[row][col + 7]`) are White (0), the output pixel `output[row][col]` becomes Gray (5).
    *   In *all other cases* (i.e., if at least one of the corresponding input pixels is not White), the output pixel `output[row][col]` becomes White (0).

## Facts


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_shape_relation: The output grid has the same height as the input grid and half the width.
  input_colors_present: [White, Green, Red] # 0, 3, 2
  output_colors_present: [White, Gray] # 0, 5
  input_structure: The input grid can be conceptually divided into a left half (first 7 columns) and a right half (last 7 columns).
objects:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: White (0), Green (3), Red (2) in input; White (0), Gray (5) in output
      - position: (row, column)
relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: Each pixel at (row, col) in the output grid corresponds to two pixels in the input grid: one at (row, col) and another at (row, col + input_width/2).
actions:
  - action: compare_pixels
    inputs:
      - pixel_left: Input pixel at (row, col)
      - pixel_right: Input pixel at (row, col + input_width/2)
    output: Output pixel value at (row, col)
    rule:
      if pixel_left is White (0) and pixel_right is White (0):
        output is Gray (5)
      else:
        output is White (0)
  - action: generate_output_grid
    description: Create an output grid with the same height and half the width of the input grid. Populate each cell based on the compare_pixels rule.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Determine the dimensions of the input grid (height `H`, width `W`).
2.  Create a new output grid with dimensions `H` rows and `W/2` columns.
3.  Iterate through each cell of the *output* grid, using row index `r` (from 0 to `H-1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W/2 - 1`).
4.  For each output cell `(r, c)`, identify the two corresponding input cells:
    *   Left input cell: `input[r][c]`
    *   Right input cell: `input[r][c + W/2]`
5.  Compare the colors of the left and right input cells:
    *   If the color of the left input cell is White (0) AND the color of the right input cell is White (0), set the output cell `output[r][c]` to Gray (5).
    *   Otherwise (if either or both corresponding input cells are not White), set the output cell `output[r][c]` to White (0).
6.  Return the generated output grid.
