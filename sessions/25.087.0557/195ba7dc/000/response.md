Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** All input grids have dimensions 5x13. They consistently feature a single vertical line of red pixels (color 2) in the 7th column (index 6). This red line acts as a separator, dividing the grid into two equally sized sections: a left half (columns 0-5) and a right half (columns 7-12).
2.  **Input Grid Content:** Apart from the red separator, the input grids contain only white (0) and orange (7) pixels. These pixels form patterns within the left and right halves.
3.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids have dimensions 5x6. This matches the dimensions of the left and right halves of the input grid.
4.  **Output Grid Content:** The output grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the left and right halves of the input grid element-wise.
    *   Observing the relationship between corresponding cells `(r, c)` in the left half (`input[r][c]`) and the right half (`input[r][c+7]`) and the output cell `output[r][c]`:
        *   If `input[r][c]` is white (0) AND `input[r][c+7]` is white (0), then `output[r][c]` is white (0).
        *   If `input[r][c]` is orange (7) AND `input[r][c+7]` is white (0), then `output[r][c]` is blue (1).
        *   If `input[r][c]` is white (0) AND `input[r][c+7]` is orange (7), then `output[r][c]` is blue (1).
        *   If `input[r][c]` is orange (7) AND `input[r][c+7]` is orange (7), then `output[r][c]` is blue (1).
    *   This pattern corresponds to a logical OR operation: if either the left cell or the right cell (or both) at a given position is orange (7), the output cell at that position is blue (1). Only if both corresponding input cells are white (0) is the output cell white (0).

  rule: |
    Map white_0 from input to logical FALSE.
    Map orange_7 from input to logical TRUE.
    Perform logical OR on the mapped values from the corresponding left and right half cells.
    Map the result FALSE back to white_0 in the output.
    Map the result TRUE back to blue_1 in the output.
  equivalent_rule: |
    If the cell at (r, c) in the left half is white_0 AND the cell at (r, c) in the right half is white_0, the output cell at (r, c) is white_0.
    Otherwise, the output cell at (r, c) is blue_1.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the vertical red line (color 2) in the input grid. This line serves as a separator.
2.  Define the 'left half' as the portion of the input grid to the left of the red line (columns 0 to 5).
3.  Define the 'right half' as the portion of the input grid to the right of the red line (columns 7 to 12).
4.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the left half (5 rows, 6 columns).
5.  Iterate through each cell position `(row, column)` within the dimensions of the left half (or output grid).
6.  For the current position `(row, column)`:
    a.  Get the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the left half.
    b.  Get the color of the corresponding cell at `(row, column)` in the right half (which corresponds to `(row, column + 7)` in the original input grid).
    c.  Compare the two colors obtained in steps 6a and 6b.
    d.  If *both* colors are white (0), set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to white (0).
    e.  Otherwise (if at least one of the colors is orange (7)), set the color of the cell at `(row, column)` in the output grid to blue (1).
7.  The resulting grid is the final output.
