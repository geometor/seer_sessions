They consistently feature a single vertical line of red pixels (color 2) in the 7th column (index 6). This red line acts as a separator, dividing the grid into two equally sized sections: a left half (columns 0-5) and a right half (columns 7-12).\n2.  **Input Grid Content:** Apart from the red separator, the input grids contain only white (0) and orange (7) pixels. These pixels form patterns within the left and right halves.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** All output grids have dimensions 5x6. This matches the dimensions of the left and right halves of the input grid.\n4.  **Output Grid Content:** The output grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the left and right halves of the input grid element-wise.\n    *   Observing the relationship between corresponding cells `(r, c)` in the left half (`input[r][c]`) and the right half (`input[r][c+7]`) and the output cell `output[r][c]`:\n        *   If `input[r][c]` is white (0) AND `input[r][c+7]` is white (0), then `output[r][c]` is white (0).\n        *   If `input[r][c]` is orange (7) AND `input[r][c+7]` is white (0), then `output[r][c]` is blue (1).\n        *   If `input[r][c]` is white (0) AND `input[r][c+7]` is orange (7), then `output[r][c]` is blue (1).\n        *   If `input[r][c]` is orange (7) AND `input[r][c+7]` is orange (7), then `output[r][c]` is blue (1).\n    *   This pattern corresponds to a logical OR operation: if either the left cell or the right cell (or both) at a given position is orange (7), the output cell at that position is blue (1). Only if both corresponding input cells are white (0) is the output cell white (0).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
