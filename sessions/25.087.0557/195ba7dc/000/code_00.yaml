task_description: Compare corresponding elements from the left and right halves of the input grid, divided by a red line, to generate the output grid.
input_grid:
  properties:
    height: 5
    width: 13
    colors_present: [white_0, orange_7, red_2]
  structure:
    separator:
      type: vertical_line
      color: red_2
      column_index: 6
    left_half:
      columns: 0-5
      colors_present: [white_0, orange_7]
    right_half:
      columns: 7-12
      colors_present: [white_0, orange_7]
output_grid:
  properties:
    height: 5
    width: 6
    colors_present: [white_0, blue_1]
transformation:
  type: elementwise_comparison
  input_elements:
    - source: left_half
      position: [r, c]
    - source: right_half
      position: [r, c] # Relative to the start of the right half
  output_element:
    position: [r, c] # Relative to the output grid
  rule: |
    Map white_0 from input to logical FALSE.
    Map orange_7 from input to logical TRUE.
    Perform logical OR on the mapped values from the corresponding left and right half cells.
    Map the result FALSE back to white_0 in the output.
    Map the result TRUE back to blue_1 in the output.
  equivalent_rule: |
    If the cell at (r, c) in the left half is white_0 AND the cell at (r, c) in the right half is white_0, the output cell at (r, c) is white_0.
    Otherwise, the output cell at (r, c) is blue_1.
