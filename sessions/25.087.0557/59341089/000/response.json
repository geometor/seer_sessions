The height remains the same, while the width becomes four times the original width.\n    *   The output grid appears to be composed of four concatenated 3x3 blocks.\n    *   Comparing the blocks in the output to the input grid reveals a pattern involving the original input and its horizontal reflection.\n    *   Specifically, the output seems to be constructed by alternating between a horizontally flipped version of the input and the original input, repeated twice. Let's denote the input grid as `I` and its horizontal flip as `HF(I)`. The output `O` structure appears to be `O = HF(I) | I | HF(I) | I`, where `|` represents horizontal concatenation.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
