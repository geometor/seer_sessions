*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The task involves transforming a small input grid into a larger output grid.
    *   All example inputs are 3x3 grids.
    *   All example outputs are 3x12 grids. The height remains the same, while the width becomes four times the original width.
    *   The output grid appears to be composed of four concatenated 3x3 blocks.
    *   Comparing the blocks in the output to the input grid reveals a pattern involving the original input and its horizontal reflection.
    *   Specifically, the output seems to be constructed by alternating between a horizontally flipped version of the input and the original input, repeated twice. Let's denote the input grid as `I` and its horizontal flip as `HF(I)`. The output `O` structure appears to be `O = HF(I) | I | HF(I) | I`, where `|` represents horizontal concatenation.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    input_properties:
      shape: [H, W]  # Examples show [3, 3]
      elements: pixels with color values (0-9)
    output_properties:
      shape: [H, 4*W] # Examples show [3, 12]
      elements: pixels with color values (0-9)
      relationship_to_input:
        - height_match: Output height equals Input height.
        - width_scaling: Output width is four times Input width.
    transformation:
      operation: horizontal_concatenation
      components:
        - source: input_grid
          action: horizontal_flip
          alias: flipped_grid
        - source: input_grid
          alias: original_grid
      sequence:
        - flipped_grid
        - original_grid
        - flipped_grid
        - original_grid
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input grid.
    2.  Generate a new grid by flipping the input grid horizontally (left becomes right, right becomes left). Call this the `flipped_grid`.
    3.  Construct the output grid by placing the `flipped_grid` side-by-side (concatenating horizontally) with the original `input_grid`.
    4.  Append another copy of the `flipped_grid` to the right of the current result.
    5.  Append another copy of the original `input_grid` to the right of the current result.
    6.  The final concatenated grid is the output.
