            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The output grid generally retains the content of the input grid in the upper part and adds new content in the lower part. The dimensions (height and width) of the output grid are the same as the input grid.\n2.  **Key Element:** A vertical bar of gray pixels (color 5) is present near the left edge (column 0) in all input examples. This bar seems crucial.\n3.  **Adjacent Shapes:** Various shapes (contiguous blocks of non-white pixels) appear immediately to the right of the gray bar in the input grids.\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation involves copying patterns downwards. The shapes horizontally adjacent to the gray bar define a vertical \"pattern block\". This pattern block seems to be repeated vertically in the empty (white) space below the original shapes.\n5.  **Copying Mechanism:** The repetition starts from the first completely white row below the original pattern block and continues downwards. The copying seems to cycle through the rows of the original pattern block. For example, if the pattern block spans rows `min_row` to `max_row`, the row copied to the first available empty row `r` is `min_row`, the row copied to `r+1` is `min_row+1`, ..., the row copied to `r + pattern_height - 1` is `max_row`, the row copied to `r + pattern_height` is `min_row` again, and so on.\n6.  **Exclusion:** The gray bar itself (column 0) is *not* copied into the lower section. Only the content to the right of the gray bar, within the pattern rows, is replicated.\n7.  **Boundary Condition:** The copying stops when it reaches the bottom edge of the grid.\n8.  **Anomaly:** Example `train_3`'s output appears slightly inconsistent with the pattern observed in the other examples if the provided output is strictly followed. However, examples `train_1`, `train_2`, `train_4`, and `train_5` strongly suggest a consistent rule of repeating the *entire* block of adjacent pattern rows. Assuming the pattern from the majority is the intended one, the rule involves repeating the full vertical slice defined by the shapes adjacent to the gray bar.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Find all non-white pixels that are horizontally adjacent (immediately to the right or left, though examples only show right) to any pixel of the gray bar.\n4.  Determine the minimum row index (`min_row`) and maximum row index (`max_row`) among all such adjacent pixels. These define the vertical extent of the \"pattern rows\".\n5.  Calculate the height of the pattern: `pattern_height = max_row - min_row + 1`.\n6.  Find the first row index `start_copy_row` such that `start_copy_row > max_row` and all pixels in this row are white (0). If no such row exists within the grid, return the original input grid.\n7.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n8.  Iterate through each `target_row` from `start_copy_row` down to the bottom of the grid (`grid_height - 1`).\n9.  For each `target_row`, calculate the corresponding source row index within the pattern rows: `source_row = min_row + (target_row - start_copy_row) % pattern_height`.\n10. Iterate through each column index `col` from 0 to the grid width (`grid_width - 1`).\n11. If `col` is not equal to `gray_col`, copy the pixel value from the input grid at `(source_row, col)` to the output grid at `(target_row, col)`. Leave the pixel at `(target_row, gray_col)` as white (or its original value if modifying in place, which should be white).\n12. Return the modified output grid."
