elements:
  - object: grid
    role: input_output
    properties:
      - height: variable (e.g., 5, 8, 9, 13, 7)
      - width: variable (e.g., 5, 7, 7, 6, 6)
  - object: vertical_bar
    color: gray (5)
    location: typically column 0, spans multiple rows
    role: anchor/source_identifier
  - object: shape
    color: various (non-white)
    location: horizontally adjacent to the gray bar
    role: pattern_element
  - object: pattern_block
    definition: the vertical sequence of rows containing shapes adjacent to the gray bar
    properties:
      - min_row: topmost row index of an adjacent shape
      - max_row: bottommost row index of an adjacent shape
      - height: max_row - min_row + 1
      - content: rows from min_row to max_row, excluding the gray bar column
  - object: empty_space
    color: white (0)
    location: rows below the pattern_block
    role: target_area_for_copying

actions:
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: gray vertical bar
  - action: identify
    actor: system
    target: shapes adjacent to the gray bar
  - action: determine
    actor: system
    target: pattern_block (rows min_row to max_row)
  - action: locate
    actor: system
    target: first empty row below pattern_block (start_copy_row)
  - action: copy_and_repeat
    actor: system
    source: pattern_block rows (excluding gray bar column)
    target: empty_space starting at start_copy_row
    details:
      - Iterate target rows from start_copy_row to grid_height - 1.
      - For each target row, determine the corresponding source row within the pattern block using modulo arithmetic based on pattern height.
      - Copy the content of the source row (excluding the gray bar column) to the target row.

    object2: empty_space
    relation: pattern_block is above empty_space
  - type: transformation
