"""
Transforms a 4x9 grid containing two distinct non-white objects into a 3x3 grid. 
The transformation rule depends on the properties of these two objects, specifically their pixel counts and the number of rows they occupy.

1.  Identify the two distinct, non-white colored objects in the input grid using 4-connectivity.
2.  For each object, determine its color, pixel count, leftmost column index, and the number of unique rows it occupies.
3.  Sort the objects based on their leftmost column index to identify the left object (L) and right object (R).
4.  Let L's color be C_l, count be Nl, and row count be Rows_l.
5.  Let R's color be C_r, count be Nr, and row count be Rows_r.
6.  Compare Nl and Nr:
    a.  If Nl == Nr:
        i.  If Nl >= 12, use Pattern C: [[C_l, C_l, C_l], [C_r, C_r, C_r], [0, 0, 0]].
        ii. If Nl < 12, use Pattern E: [[C_l, 0, 0], [C_r, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].
    b.  If Nl > Nr:
        i.  Calculate Diff = Nl - Nr.
        ii. If Diff == 2:
            1. If Rows_r < Rows_l, use Pattern B: [[C_l, C_l, C_l], [C_r, C_r, 0], [0, 0, 0]].
            2. Otherwise (Rows_r >= Rows_l), use Pattern D: [[C_l, C_l, C_l], [C_l, 0, 0], [C_r, C_r, 0]].
        iii. (Other differences for Nl > Nr are not handled based on examples).
    c.  If Nl < Nr:
        i.  Calculate Diff = Nr - Nl.
        ii. If Diff >= 6, use Pattern A: [[C_l, 0, 0], [C_r, C_r, C_r], [C_r, C_r, C_r]].
        iii. If Diff == 2, use Pattern F: [[C_l, C_l, 0], [C_r, C_r, C_r], [0, 0, 0]].
        iv.  (Other differences for Nl < Nr are not handled based on examples).
7.  Construct the 3x3 output grid using the selected pattern.
