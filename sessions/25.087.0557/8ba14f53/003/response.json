Identify the two distinct, non-white colored objects in the input grid using 4-connectivity.\n2.  For each object, determine its color, pixel count, leftmost column index, and the number of unique rows it occupies.\n3.  Sort the objects based on their leftmost column index to identify the left object (L) and right object (R).\n4.  Let L's color be C_l, count be Nl, and row count be Rows_l.\n5.  Let R's color be C_r, count be Nr, and row count be Rows_r.\n6.  Compare Nl and Nr:\n    a.  If Nl == Nr:\n        i.  If Nl >= 12, use Pattern C: [[C_l, C_l, C_l], [C_r, C_r, C_r], [0, 0, 0]].\n        ii. If Nl < 12, use Pattern E: [[C_l, 0, 0], [C_r, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n    b.  If Nl > Nr:\n        i.  Calculate Diff = Nl - Nr.\n        ii. If Diff == 2:\n            1. If Rows_r < Rows_l, use Pattern B: [[C_l, C_l, C_l], [C_r, C_r, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n            2. Otherwise (Rows_r >= Rows_l), use Pattern D: [[C_l, C_l, C_l], [C_l, 0, 0], [C_r, C_r, 0]].\n        iii. (Other differences for Nl > Nr are not handled based on examples).\n    c.  If Nl < Nr:\n        i.  Calculate Diff = Nr - Nl.\n        ii. If Diff >= 6, use Pattern A: [[C_l, 0, 0], [C_r, C_r, C_r], [C_r, C_r, C_r]].\n        iii. If Diff == 2, use Pattern F: [[C_l, C_l, 0], [C_r, C_r, C_r], [0, 0, 0]].\n        iv.  (Other differences for Nl < Nr are not handled based on examples).\n7.
