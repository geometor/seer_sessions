*   **Perception:** The task takes an input grid filled entirely with white pixels and transforms it into an output grid of the same dimensions. The output grid exhibits a consistent checkerboard-like pattern using blue and white pixels, but with a modification: all pixels in even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4, ...) are blue, overriding the checkerboard pattern for those rows. Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5, ...) follow a standard checkerboard pattern starting with blue in the first column (column 0). The size of the input grid determines the size of the output grid, but the input pixel values themselves (all white) do not seem to influence the specific output pattern beyond setting the canvas size.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    input_properties:
      - object: input_grid
        attributes:
          - type: grid
          - content: all pixels are white (0)
          - dimensions: variable height and width (e.g., 7x7, 5x5, 9x9)
    output_properties:
      - object: output_grid
        attributes:
          - type: grid
          - content: pattern of blue (1) and white (0) pixels
          - dimensions: identical to the corresponding input_grid
          - pattern_rule:
              - condition: row index is even
                result: all pixels in the row are blue (1)
              - condition: row index is odd
                result: pixels alternate between blue (1) and white (0) starting with blue (1) at column index 0
    relationships:
      - input_grid determines the dimensions (height, width) of the output_grid.
      - The output pattern is solely determined by the row and column indices of each pixel within the grid dimensions.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Determine the height and width of the input grid.
    2.  Create a new output grid with the same height and width.
    3.  Iterate through each pixel location `(row, column)` in the new grid, from `row = 0` to `height - 1` and `column = 0` to `width - 1`.
    4.  For each pixel:
        a.  Check if the `row` index is even.
        b.  If the `row` index is even, set the pixel color to blue (1).
        c.  If the `row` index is odd:
            i.  Check if the `column` index is even.
            ii. If the `column` index is even, set the pixel color to blue (1).
            iii.If the `column` index is odd, set the pixel color to white (0).
    5.  Return the completed output grid.
