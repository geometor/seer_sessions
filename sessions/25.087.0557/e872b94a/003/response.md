"""
This program identifies distinct groups of connected gray (5) pixels in an input grid, where connectivity is defined by cardinal adjacency (up, down, left, right). It then creates an output grid which is a single column filled with white (0) pixels. The height of this output column is equal to the total count of the distinct gray objects found in the input grid, plus one.
