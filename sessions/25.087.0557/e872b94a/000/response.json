The gray pixels form distinct shapes or clusters scattered across the grid.\n2.  **Output Data:** The outputs are always 1D vertical grids (column vectors) of varying heights. These output grids consist entirely of white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation seems to involve analyzing the gray pixels in the input grid. Specifically, the *number* of distinct gray shapes or objects in the input determines the *height* of the white output column.\n4.  **Object Definition:** Based on the examples (especially comparing train\\_2, train\\_3, and train\\_4), an \"object\" appears to be a group of gray pixels connected cardinally (horizontally or vertically adjacent), but not diagonally.\n5.  **Relationship:** The number of contiguous gray objects (using cardinal adjacency) in the input grid directly corresponds to the height of the all-white output column.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Pixels that are only diagonally adjacent are not considered connected for forming a single object. Each such distinct group constitutes one \"object\".\n4.  Count the total number of these distinct gray objects. Let this count be `N`.\n5.  Construct the output grid: It will have a width of 1 and a height of `N`.\n6.
