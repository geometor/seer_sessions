elements:
  - entity: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing the input and output spaces.
  - entity: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white (0) or gray (5) in the input. Output pixels are always white (0).
      - position: Defined by row and column index within the grid.
  - entity: object
    description: A contiguous group of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Always gray (5).
      - connectivity: Defined by cardinal adjacency (pixels share a side: up, down, left, or right). Pixels connected only diagonally do not belong to the same object.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Locate all gray (5) pixels and group them into distinct objects based on cardinal connectivity.
  - action: count_objects
    description: Determine the total number of distinct gray objects identified in the input grid.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Generate a new grid with specific dimensions and content.
    parameters:
      - width: Always 1.
      - height: Equal to the count of gray objects from the input.
      - fill_color: Always white (0).
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_height
    description: The height of the output grid is numerically equal to the count of distinct gray objects found in the input grid.
