Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Data:** The inputs are 2D grids of varying dimensions. The grids contain two colors: white (0) and gray (5). The gray pixels form distinct shapes or clusters scattered across the grid.
2.  **Output Data:** The outputs are always 1D vertical grids (column vectors) of varying heights. These output grids consist entirely of white (0) pixels.
3.  **Transformation:** The key transformation seems to involve analyzing the gray pixels in the input grid. Specifically, the *number* of distinct gray shapes or objects in the input determines the *height* of the white output column.
4.  **Object Definition:** Based on the examples (especially comparing train\_2, train\_3, and train\_4), an "object" appears to be a group of gray pixels connected cardinally (horizontally or vertically adjacent), but not diagonally.
5.  **Relationship:** The number of contiguous gray objects (using cardinal adjacency) in the input grid directly corresponds to the height of the all-white output column.

**Facts**


```yaml
elements:
  - entity: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels representing the input and output spaces.
  - entity: pixel
    properties:
      - color: Can be white (0) or gray (5) in the input. Output pixels are always white (0).
      - position: Defined by row and column index within the grid.
  - entity: object
    description: A contiguous group of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Always gray (5).
      - connectivity: Defined by cardinal adjacency (pixels share a side: up, down, left, or right). Pixels connected only diagonally do not belong to the same object.
actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    description: Locate all gray (5) pixels and group them into distinct objects based on cardinal connectivity.
  - action: count_objects
    description: Determine the total number of distinct gray objects identified in the input grid.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Generate a new grid with specific dimensions and content.
    parameters:
      - width: Always 1.
      - height: Equal to the count of gray objects from the input.
      - fill_color: Always white (0).
relationships:
  - relationship: input_output_height
    description: The height of the output grid is numerically equal to the count of distinct gray objects found in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input grid containing white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all gray (5) pixels.
3.  Identify distinct groups of connected gray pixels. Consider two gray pixels connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (sharing an edge). Pixels that are only diagonally adjacent are not considered connected for forming a single object. Each such distinct group constitutes one "object".
4.  Count the total number of these distinct gray objects. Let this count be `N`.
5.  Construct the output grid: It will have a width of 1 and a height of `N`.
6.  Fill every pixel in the output grid with the white (0) color.
7.  Return the resulting `N x 1` white grid.
