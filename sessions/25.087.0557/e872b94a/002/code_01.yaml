task_description: Transform an input grid containing gray objects into a single white column whose height depends on the number of gray objects.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white) # The predominant color, assumed not part of objects.
  - object_color: 5 (gray) # The color of the pixels forming the objects of interest.
objects:
  - type: connected_group
    description: A set of pixels of the same color (gray) where each pixel is connected to at least one other pixel in the group through adjacency.
    color: 5 (gray)
    connectivity: cardinal # Pixels are connected if they share an edge (up, down, left, right). Full adjacency (including diagonals) yields the same count for training data but cardinal is simpler.
object_properties:
  - name: object_count
    value: The total number of distinct, cardinally connected gray objects in the input grid.
