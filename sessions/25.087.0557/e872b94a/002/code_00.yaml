task_description: Generate a white column whose height is related to the number of gray objects in the input grid.
grid_properties:
  - background_color: 0 (white)
  - relevant_color: 5 (gray)
objects:
  - type: group of connected pixels
  - color: 5 (gray)
  - connectivity: cardinal (up, down, left, right) or full (including diagonals) - both yield the same count in training examples. Let's stick with cardinal for simplicity.
object_properties:
  - count: Number of distinct gray objects in the input grid.
transformation:
  - step: Identify all distinct groups of connected gray pixels in the input grid using cardinal adjacency.
  - step: Count the total number of these distinct gray objects (let this be N).
  - step: Create an output grid.
output_grid_properties:
  - width: 1
  - height: N + 1
  - color: 0 (white)
