    # What if the non-white pixel *is* in column 0? The rule works if gray is in col > 0.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the approach.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The previous code successfully identified the core mechanic (recoloring gray pixels based on a leftward scan) but failed when encountering consecutive gray pixels in a row. The error analysis shows that the code correctly changed the *first* gray pixel in a horizontal sequence but left subsequent adjacent gray pixels unchanged. This suggests the scanning rule needs refinement.

My hypothesis is that the scan should not just look for the first *non-white* pixel, but the first pixel that is *neither white (0) nor gray (5)*. This would explain why consecutive gray pixels adopt the color from further left, as the scan would pass over the intermediate gray pixels.

The strategy is to:
1.  Verify this hypothesis using code execution to analyze the examples.
2.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this refined rule.
3.  The coder phase will then implement this updated logic.

```
The analysis confirms the hypothesis. For every gray pixel (5) in the input that changes color in the output, the new color matches the color of the first pixel found by scanning leftward in the same row, *ignoring* any white (0) or gray (5) pixels encountered during the scan. The `hypothesis_valid` flag is true for both examples.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Iterate through each row (`r`) and column (`c`) of the input grid.
3.  Check if the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid is gray (5).
4.  If it is gray (5):
    a.  Initiate a search for a "source color". Start scanning from the column immediately to the left (`c-1`) and move towards the beginning of the row (column 0).
    b.  For each column `scan_c` checked during the scan:
        i.  Get the color `scan_color` of the pixel at `(r, scan_c)` in the *input* grid.
        ii. If `scan_color` is *not* white (0) and *not* gray (5), then this is the source color. Stop scanning for this gray pixel.
    c.  Update the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to be the found source color.
5.  If the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the input grid was *not* gray (5), its color in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid (already handled by copying initially).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
