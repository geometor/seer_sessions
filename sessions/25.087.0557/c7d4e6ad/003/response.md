"""
Recolor each gray (5) pixel in the input grid. 
The replacement color is determined by scanning leftwards from the gray pixel's position within the same row.
The color of the first pixel encountered during this scan whose color is neither white (0) nor gray (5) is used as the replacement color.
All other pixels retain their original color.
