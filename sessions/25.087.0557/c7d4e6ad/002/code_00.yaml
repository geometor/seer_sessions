  action:
    type: recolor
    rule: "For each gray pixel, find the first pixel to its left in the same row whose color is neither white (0) nor gray (5). Use this identified color as the new color for the original gray pixel."

objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9) mapped to specific colors (white, blue, red, etc.)
      - position: (row, column) coordinate within the grid
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: height, width (between 1x1 and 30x30)
      - content: 2D array of pixels (represented by color integers)

relationships:
  - type: spatial

  - type: horizontal_scan
    description: "A leftward search is performed within a row, starting from the column to the left of the target gray pixel."
    filter: "The scan ignores pixels with color white (0) or gray (5)."

transformation:
  scope: "Applies only to pixels with the initial color gray (5)."
  process:
    - "Iterate through each pixel of the input grid."
    - "If a pixel's color is gray (5):"
      - "Initialize a scan starting from the column immediately to the left (c-1) and moving towards column 0 within the same row (r)."
      - "During the scan, examine the color of each pixel encountered."
      - "If the pixel's color is white (0) or gray (5), continue the scan leftward."
      - "If the pixel's color is anything other than white (0) or gray (5), stop the scan. This is the 'source color'."
      - "Replace the color of the original gray pixel at (r, c) with this 'source color'."
    - "If a pixel's initial color is not gray (5), its color remains unchanged in the output grid."
  input_invariance: "The dimensions (height and width) of the grid remain unchanged."
  color_palette_change: "Gray (5) pixels are removed from the output, replaced by other colors already present in the input (excluding white and gray itself as sources)."
