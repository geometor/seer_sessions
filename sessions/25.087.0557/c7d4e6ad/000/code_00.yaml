task_context:
  description: "Recoloring specific pixels based on horizontal neighbors."
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - primary_change_color: gray (5)
    - source_colors: Various colors located primarily in the first column.

elements:
  - type: "background"
    color: white (0)
    description: "The predominant color in the grid, which remains unchanged."
  - type: "source_marker"
    color: Non-white (1-9)
    location: Typically in the first column, but generally the first non-white pixel to the left.
    description: "Pixels whose color determines the replacement color for gray pixels in the same row."
  - type: "target_pixel"
    color: gray (5)
    description: "Pixels in the input grid that are targeted for recoloring."

transformation:
  action: "Recolor"
  target: "All gray (5) pixels."
  rule: "Each gray pixel takes the color of the first non-white pixel encountered when searching leftwards from its position within the same row."
  unchanged_pixels: "All non-gray pixels retain their original color and position."

relationships:
  - type: "Horizontal Scan"
    description: "For each gray pixel, a leftward scan in the same row identifies the source color."
  - type: "Color Inheritance"
    description: "Gray pixels adopt the color of their identified horizontal source marker."
