Okay, let's break down the transformation in these examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Background:** Both input and output grids primarily use white (0) as the background color.
2.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain distinct vertical bars of color (azure/red in example 1, maroon/magenta/yellow in example 2) located in the first column (index 0). Additionally, there are scattered pixels of gray (5). Some gray pixels form small shapes or lines.
3.  **Output Objects:** The output grids retain the original colored bars from the first column. The key change is that all the gray (5) pixels from the input have been replaced by other colors. The replacement color seems related to the colored bars on the left.
4.  **Transformation:** It appears that each gray pixel "inherits" or gets "painted" with the color of the nearest non-white pixel found by looking directly leftwards in the same row. In these specific examples, the relevant non-white pixel always corresponds to the color found in the first column of that row.

**Facts YAML:**


```yaml
task_context:
  description: "Recoloring specific pixels based on horizontal neighbors."
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - primary_change_color: gray (5)
    - source_colors: Various colors located primarily in the first column.

elements:
  - type: "background"
    color: white (0)
    description: "The predominant color in the grid, which remains unchanged."
  - type: "source_marker"
    color: Non-white (1-9)
    location: Typically in the first column, but generally the first non-white pixel to the left.
    description: "Pixels whose color determines the replacement color for gray pixels in the same row."
  - type: "target_pixel"
    color: gray (5)
    description: "Pixels in the input grid that are targeted for recoloring."

transformation:
  action: "Recolor"
  target: "All gray (5) pixels."
  rule: "Each gray pixel takes the color of the first non-white pixel encountered when searching leftwards from its position within the same row."
  unchanged_pixels: "All non-gray pixels retain their original color and position."

relationships:
  - type: "Horizontal Scan"
    description: "For each gray pixel, a leftward scan in the same row identifies the source color."
  - type: "Color Inheritance"
    description: "Gray pixels adopt the color of their identified horizontal source marker."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the same values.
2.  Iterate through each cell (pixel) of the input grid using its row and column index.
3.  If the color of the current cell in the input grid is gray (5):
    a.  Starting from the column immediately to the left of the current cell (column index - 1) and moving towards column 0, scan the cells in the *same row*.
    b.  Find the first cell encountered during this leftward scan whose color is *not* white (0).
    c.  Take the color of this found non-white cell.
    d.  Update the cell at the corresponding row and column in the *new* grid with this found color.
4.  If the color of the current cell in the input grid is *not* gray (5), its value remains unchanged in the new grid (it was already copied in step 1).
5.  The final new grid is the output.
