Additionally, there are scattered pixels of gray (5). Some gray pixels form small shapes or lines.\n3.  **Output Objects:** The output grids retain the original colored bars from the first column. The key change is that all the gray (5) pixels from the input have been replaced by other colors. The replacement color seems related to the colored bars on the left.\n4.  **Transformation:** It appears that each gray pixel \"inherits\" or gets \"painted\" with the color of the nearest non-white pixel found by looking directly leftwards in the same row. In these specific examples, the relevant non-white pixel always corresponds to the color found in the first column of that row.\n\n**Facts YAML:**\n\n"
