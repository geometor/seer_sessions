However, the copying and line insertion cover these areas. The intersection of the green lines is also green.\n5.  **Pixel Colors:** The specific non-white colors in the input (yellow, azure, orange) are preserved in the copied quadrants but do not influence the transformation structure itself (which involves copying and adding green lines).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
