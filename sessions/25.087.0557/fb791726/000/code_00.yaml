task_description: "Duplicate the input grid into the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of a doubled-size output grid, inserting a green horizontal and vertical line through the middle."

definitions:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: "The initial grid."
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: "The transformed grid."
  - name: H
    type: integer
    description: "Height of the input_grid."
  - name: W
    type: integer
    description: "Width of the input_grid."
  - name: green_color
    type: integer
    value: 3
    description: "The color used for the dividing lines."
  - name: background_color
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: "The default background color (white)."

transformations:
  - step: 1
    action: "Determine dimensions H and W of input_grid."
  - step: 2
    action: "Create output_grid with dimensions (2*H) x (2*W), initialized with background_color."
  - step: 3
    action: "Copy input_grid to the top-left quadrant of output_grid."
    details: "Region from (row 0, col 0) to (row H-1, col W-1)."
  - step: 4
    action: "Copy input_grid to the bottom-right quadrant of output_grid."
    details: "Region from (row H, col W) to (row 2*H-1, col 2*W-1)."
  - step: 5
    action: "Fill the middle horizontal row of output_grid with green_color."
    details: "Row index H, from column 0 to 2*W-1."
  - step: 6
    action: "Fill the middle vertical column of output_grid with green_color."
    details: "Column index W, from row 0 to 2*H-1."

relationships:
  - "Output grid height is 2 * Input grid height."
  - "Output grid width is 2 * Input grid width."
  - "The input grid is replicated diagonally."
  - "Green lines act as separators between the replicated quadrants and also overwrite parts of the potential background quadrants."
