Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The output grid dimensions are consistently double the input grid dimensions (both height and width).
    *   `train_1`: Input 6x6 -> Output 12x12
    *   `train_2`: Input 3x3 -> Output 6x6
    *   `train_3`: Input 7x7 -> Output 14x14
2.  **Content Copying:** The original input grid appears twice in the output grid:
    *   Once in the top-left quadrant.
    *   Once in the bottom-right quadrant.
3.  **Inserted Lines:** A single horizontal line and a single vertical line, both composed entirely of green pixels (color 3), are inserted into the output grid.
    *   The horizontal green line is inserted exactly in the middle row, separating the top and bottom halves (at index H, where H is the input height).
    *   The vertical green line is inserted exactly in the middle column, separating the left and right halves (at index W, where W is the input width).
4.  **Background:** The remaining areas of the output grid (top-right and bottom-left quadrants, excluding the green lines) seem to remain the background color, which is white (color 0) in these examples. However, the copying and line insertion cover these areas. The intersection of the green lines is also green.
5.  **Pixel Colors:** The specific non-white colors in the input (yellow, azure, orange) are preserved in the copied quadrants but do not influence the transformation structure itself (which involves copying and adding green lines).

  - step: 6
    action: "Fill the middle vertical column of output_grid with green_color."
    details: "Column index W, from row 0 to 2*H-1."

relationships:
  - "Output grid height is 2 * Input grid height."
  - "Output grid width is 2 * Input grid width."
  - "The input grid is replicated diagonally."
  - "Green lines act as separators between the replicated quadrants and also overwrite parts of the potential background quadrants."
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Get the input grid. Let its height be H and width be W.
2.  Create a new output grid with height 2*H and width 2*W, filled with white (0).
3.  Copy the content of the input grid to the top-left region of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1).
4.  Copy the content of the input grid to the bottom-right region of the output grid (rows H to 2*H-1, columns W to 2*W-1).
5.  Set all pixels in the row at index H (the (H+1)th row) of the output grid to green (3).
6.  Set all pixels in the column at index W (the (W+1)th column) of the output grid to green (3).
