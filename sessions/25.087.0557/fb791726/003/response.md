"""
Create an output grid that is double the height and width of the input grid.
Initialize the output grid with the background color (white, 0).
Iterate through each row of the input grid.
If a row in the input grid consists entirely of the background color (white, 0), 
then the corresponding row in the top half of the output grid and the corresponding 
row in the bottom half of the output grid (offset by the input grid's height) 
are filled entirely with green (3).
If a row in the input grid contains any non-background color, then that row is copied 
to the corresponding row in the top-left quadrant of the output grid and also copied 
to the corresponding row in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid (offset by 
the input grid's height and width).
