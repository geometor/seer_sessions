*   **Perception:** The task requires analyzing an input grid containing various colored pixels, including lines and other shapes. The output is always a single color value (a 1x1 grid). The goal seems to be identifying a specific feature within the input grid and outputting its color. The key feature appears to be a solid line (either horizontal or vertical) that stretches across the entire corresponding dimension of the grid (width for horizontal lines, height for vertical lines). Other lines or shapes present in the grid seem to act as distractors.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the color of the line that spans the entire grid dimension.
    
    elements:
      - element: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with different colors (0-9).
        properties:
          - height: The number of rows.
          - width: The number of columns.
      - element: pixel
        description: A single cell within the grid.
        properties:
          - color: An integer from 0 to 9.
          - position: (row, column) coordinates.
      - element: line
        description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same non-white color, either horizontally or vertically aligned.
        properties:
          - color: The color of the pixels comprising the line.
          - orientation: Horizontal or Vertical.
          - length: The number of pixels in the line.
          - span: Whether the line's length equals the grid's width (if horizontal) or height (if vertical).
    
    relationships:
      - relationship: A line is contained within the grid.
      - relationship: A line is composed of pixels of the same color.
      - relationship: A "spanning line" is a line whose length matches the grid dimension corresponding to its orientation (width for horizontal, height for vertical).
    
    transformation:
      - action: Scan the grid to find all horizontal lines of a single non-white color.
      - action: Check if any horizontal line's length equals the grid's width. If found, record its color.
      - action: Scan the grid to find all vertical lines of a single non-white color.
      - action: Check if any vertical line's length equals the grid's height. If found, record its color.
      - action: Determine the final output color based on the color recorded from the spanning line (either horizontal or vertical). The examples suggest only one such line exists per input.
    
    output:
      - element: color_value
        description: A single integer representing the color of the identified spanning line.
        properties:
          - value: An integer from 1 to 9.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Examine the input grid's dimensions (height H, width W).
    2.  Iterate through each row of the grid to identify potential horizontal spanning lines:
        *   For a given row, check if all pixels have the same non-white color.
        *   If such a row is found, its color is the target color. Proceed to step 4.
    3.  If no horizontal spanning line is found, iterate through each column of the grid to identify potential vertical spanning lines:
        *   For a given column, check if all pixels have the same non-white color.
        *   If such a column is found, its color is the target color. Proceed to step 4.
    4.  Output the identified target color as a 1x1 grid.
