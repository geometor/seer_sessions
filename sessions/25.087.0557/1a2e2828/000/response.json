The output is always a single color value (a 1x1 grid). The goal seems to be identifying a specific feature within the input grid and outputting its color. The key feature appears to be a solid line (either horizontal or vertical) that stretches across the entire corresponding dimension of the grid (width for horizontal lines, height for vertical lines). Other lines or shapes present in the grid seem to act as distractors.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
