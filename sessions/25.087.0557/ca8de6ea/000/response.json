            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 5x5, and the output grids are consistently 3x3.\n2.  **Content:** Both input and output grids contain colored pixels (represented by numbers 1-9) and white pixels (represented by 0). The input grids have many white pixels, while the output grids contain only colored pixels derived from the input.\n3.  **Pixel Selection:** The output grid seems to be formed by selecting specific colored pixels from the input grid. In all examples, there are exactly 9 non-white pixels in the input, matching the 9 pixels required for the 3x3 output.\n4.  **Spatial Mapping:** The positions of the selected pixels in the input map directly to specific positions in the output grid.\n    *   The pixel at the center of the input (2, 2) maps to the center of the output (1, 1).\n    *   The pixels at the four corners of the input (0,0; 0,4; 4,0; 4,4) map to the four corners of the output (0,0; 0,2; 2,0; 2,2), maintaining their relative corner positions.\n    *   The pixels located just inside the corners along the diagonals of the input's central 3x3 region (1,1; 1,3; 3,1; 3,3) map to the middle positions of the output grid's edges. Specifically:\n        *   Input (1, 1) maps to Output (0, 1) (Top edge)\n        *   Input (1, 3) maps to Output (1, 2) (Right edge)\n        *   Input (3, 1) maps to Output (1, 0) (Left edge)\n        *   Input (3, 3) maps to Output (2, 1) (Bottom edge)\n5.  **Ignored Pixels:** All white pixels (0) and any other colored pixels not in the 9 specific locations identified above are ignored.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
