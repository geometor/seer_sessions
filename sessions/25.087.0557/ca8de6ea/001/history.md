Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 5x5, and the output grids are consistently 3x3.
2.  **Content:** Both input and output grids contain colored pixels (represented by numbers 1-9) and white pixels (represented by 0). The input grids have many white pixels, while the output grids contain only colored pixels derived from the input.
3.  **Pixel Selection:** The output grid seems to be formed by selecting specific colored pixels from the input grid. In all examples, there are exactly 9 non-white pixels in the input, matching the 9 pixels required for the 3x3 output.
4.  **Spatial Mapping:** The positions of the selected pixels in the input map directly to specific positions in the output grid.
    *   The pixel at the center of the input (2, 2) maps to the center of the output (1, 1).
    *   The pixels at the four corners of the input (0,0; 0,4; 4,0; 4,4) map to the four corners of the output (0,0; 0,2; 2,0; 2,2), maintaining their relative corner positions.
    *   The pixels located just inside the corners along the diagonals of the input's central 3x3 region (1,1; 1,3; 3,1; 3,3) map to the middle positions of the output grid's edges. Specifically:
        *   Input (1, 1) maps to Output (0, 1) (Top edge)
        *   Input (1, 3) maps to Output (1, 2) (Right edge)
        *   Input (3, 1) maps to Output (1, 0) (Left edge)
        *   Input (3, 3) maps to Output (2, 1) (Bottom edge)
5.  **Ignored Pixels:** All white pixels (0) and any other colored pixels not in the 9 specific locations identified above are ignored.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the 9 key pixels in the 5x5 input grid based on their fixed positions:
    *   The four corner pixels: (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4).
    *   The center pixel: (2,2).
    *   The four pixels adjacent to the center along diagonals within the central 3x3 region: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3).
2.  Create a new 3x3 output grid.
3.  Place the identified pixels into the output grid according to the following mapping (Input Position -> Output Position):
    *   Center: (2,2) -> (1,1)
    *   Corners:
        *   (0,0) -> (0,0)
        *   (0,4) -> (0,2)
        *   (4,0) -> (2,0)
        *   (4,4) -> (2,2)
    *   Inner Edges:
        *   (1,1) -> (0,1)
        *   (1,3) -> (1,2)
        *   (3,1) -> (1,0)
        *   (3,3) -> (2,1)
4.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
