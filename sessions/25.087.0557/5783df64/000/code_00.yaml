task_description: Map non-white pixels from a partitioned input grid to a 3x3 output grid based on subgrid location.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H (variable, multiple of 3, e.g., 6, 9)
    - width: W (variable, multiple of 3, e.g., 6, 9)
  structure:
    - partitioned into a 3x3 grid of subgrids.
    - each subgrid has dimensions (H/3, W/3).
  objects:
    - type: pixel
    - identifier: non-white color (value 1-9)
    - count: 9
    - distribution: exactly one non-white pixel per subgrid.

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 3
    - width: 3
  structure:
    - contains pixels corresponding to the non-white pixels from the input.

transformation:
  - name: Partition and Map
  - steps:
      - Determine input dimensions H and W.
      - Calculate subgrid dimensions: sub_H = H / 3, sub_W = W / 3.
      - For each cell (R_out, C_out) in the 3x3 output grid (where R_out, C_out are 0, 1, 2):
          - Identify the corresponding input subgrid located at rows [R_out * sub_H, (R_out + 1) * sub_H - 1] and columns [C_out * sub_W, (C_out + 1) * sub_W - 1].
          - Find the single non-white pixel within this input subgrid.
          - Set the value of the output grid cell (R_out, C_out) to the color of the found non-white pixel.
  - constraints:
      - Input height H and width W must be divisible by 3.
      - Each (H/3) x (W/3) subgrid must contain exactly one non-white pixel.
