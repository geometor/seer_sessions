            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input grids have varying dimensions (6x6, 9x9), while the output grid is consistently 3x3.\n2.  **Colors**: All non-white colors present in the input grid are also present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced, and no colors (other than white) are removed. The background color (white, 0) is implicitly handled by the grid structure.\n3.  **Pixel Count**: Each input grid contains exactly 9 non-white pixels. The output grid is 3x3, also containing 9 pixels. This suggests a one-to-one mapping of the non-white input pixels to the output grid positions.\n4.  **Spatial Relationship**: The key seems to be the spatial organization. If we divide the input grid into a 3x3 grid of equally sized subgrids, each subgrid contains exactly one non-white pixel.\n    *   For a 6x6 input, it's divided into nine 2x2 subgrids.\n    *   For a 9x9 input, it's divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.\n5.  **Mapping**: The position of the subgrid in the input grid (e.g., top-left, middle-center, bottom-right) directly corresponds to the position in the 3x3 output grid. The color of the single non-white pixel found within an input subgrid is placed at the corresponding position in the output grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
