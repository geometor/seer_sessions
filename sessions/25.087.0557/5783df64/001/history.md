Okay, let's analyze the provided examples for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Sizes**: The input grids have varying dimensions (6x6, 9x9), while the output grid is consistently 3x3.
2.  **Colors**: All non-white colors present in the input grid are also present in the output grid. No new colors are introduced, and no colors (other than white) are removed. The background color (white, 0) is implicitly handled by the grid structure.
3.  **Pixel Count**: Each input grid contains exactly 9 non-white pixels. The output grid is 3x3, also containing 9 pixels. This suggests a one-to-one mapping of the non-white input pixels to the output grid positions.
4.  **Spatial Relationship**: The key seems to be the spatial organization. If we divide the input grid into a 3x3 grid of equally sized subgrids, each subgrid contains exactly one non-white pixel.
    *   For a 6x6 input, it's divided into nine 2x2 subgrids.
    *   For a 9x9 input, it's divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.
5.  **Mapping**: The position of the subgrid in the input grid (e.g., top-left, middle-center, bottom-right) directly corresponds to the position in the 3x3 output grid. The color of the single non-white pixel found within an input subgrid is placed at the corresponding position in the output grid.

## Facts


```yaml
task_description: Map non-white pixels from a partitioned input grid to a 3x3 output grid based on subgrid location.

input_grid:
  properties:
    - height: H (variable, multiple of 3, e.g., 6, 9)
    - width: W (variable, multiple of 3, e.g., 6, 9)
  structure:
    - partitioned into a 3x3 grid of subgrids.
    - each subgrid has dimensions (H/3, W/3).
  objects:
    - type: pixel
    - identifier: non-white color (value 1-9)
    - count: 9
    - distribution: exactly one non-white pixel per subgrid.

output_grid:
  properties:
    - height: 3
    - width: 3
  structure:
    - contains pixels corresponding to the non-white pixels from the input.

transformation:
  - name: Partition and Map
  - steps:
      - Determine input dimensions H and W.
      - Calculate subgrid dimensions: sub_H = H / 3, sub_W = W / 3.
      - For each cell (R_out, C_out) in the 3x3 output grid (where R_out, C_out are 0, 1, 2):
          - Identify the corresponding input subgrid located at rows [R_out * sub_H, (R_out + 1) * sub_H - 1] and columns [C_out * sub_W, (C_out + 1) * sub_W - 1].
          - Find the single non-white pixel within this input subgrid.
          - Set the value of the output grid cell (R_out, C_out) to the color of the found non-white pixel.
  - constraints:
      - Input height H and width W must be divisible by 3.
      - Each (H/3) x (W/3) subgrid must contain exactly one non-white pixel.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Get the input grid and determine its height (H) and width (W).
2.  Calculate the height (`sub_H`) and width (`sub_W`) of the subgrids by dividing H and W by 3, respectively (`sub_H = H / 3`, `sub_W = W / 3`).
3.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initialized with white (0), to serve as the output grid.
4.  Iterate through the 3x3 conceptual grid of subgrids using row index `R_sub` from 0 to 2 and column index `C_sub` from 0 to 2.
5.  For each (`R_sub`, `C_sub`):
    a.  Define the boundaries of the current subgrid within the input grid:
        *   `start_row = R_sub * sub_H`
        *   `end_row = start_row + sub_H`
        *   `start_col = C_sub * sub_W`
        *   `end_col = start_col + sub_W`
    b.  Search within the input grid, from row `start_row` to `end_row - 1` and from column `start_col` to `end_col - 1`, to find the single pixel whose color value is not white (0).
    c.  Take the color value found in step 5b and place it into the output grid at position (`R_sub`, `C_sub`).
6.  Return the completed 3x3 output grid.
