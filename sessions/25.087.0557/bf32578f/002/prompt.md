1. Identify the single connected group of non-background pixels (color C, ObjectPixels).
2. Perform a flood fill starting from all border background pixels (0), marking reachable background pixels. Use 4-connectivity.
3. Identify enclosed background pixels (EnclosedPixels) as those background pixels not reached by the flood fill.
4. Initialize the output grid by copying the input grid.
5. Fill the EnclosedPixels in the output grid with color C.
6. Determine if the object forms a closed loop around the enclosed area by checking if every pixel in ObjectPixels is adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least one pixel in EnclosedPixels.
7. If it forms a closed loop, set the ObjectPixels in the output grid to the background color (0). Otherwise, leave them as color C.
