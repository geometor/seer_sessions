Examples:
  - Train_1:
      Input: 10x10 grid with a white background (0) and an orange (7) 'Z' shape.
      Output: 10x10 grid where the area enclosed by the 'Z' (forming a diamond shape) is filled with orange (7). The original 'Z' pixels are included in the output shape.
      Input_Object:
        Color: 7 (orange)
        Shape_Type: Open line ('Z'/'S')
        Pixels: [(3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,2), (7,3), (8,4)]
      Output_Object:
        Color: 7 (orange)
        Shape_Type: Filled Diamond + Original 'Z'
        Enclosed_Pixels: Identified via inability to reach border from background.
        Original_Pixels_Treatment: Kept
  - Train_2:
      Input: 6x6 grid with a white background (0) and an azure (8) 'C' shape.
      Output: 6x6 grid where the 3x3 area enclosed by the 'C' is filled with azure (8). The original 'C' pixels are changed to white (0).
      Input_Object:
        Color: 8 (azure)
        Shape_Type: Closed loop ('C')
        Pixels: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)]
      Output_Object:
        Color: 8 (azure)
        Shape_Type: Filled Square
        Enclosed_Pixels: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] # Note: Adjusted coords based on visual, double check indices
        Original_Pixels_Treatment: Removed (set to 0)
  - Train_3:
      Input: 6x6 grid with a white background (0) and a magenta (6) 'Z' shape.
      Output: 6x6 grid where the area enclosed by the 'Z' (forming a diamond shape) is filled with magenta (6). The original 'Z' pixels are included in the output shape.
      Input_Object:
        Color: 6 (magenta)
        Shape_Type: Open line ('Z'/'S')
        Pixels: [(1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (5,2)]
      Output_Object:
        Color: 6 (magenta)
        Shape_Type: Filled Diamond + Original 'Z'
        Enclosed_Pixels: Identified via inability to reach border from background.
        Original_Pixels_Treatment: Kept
Properties:
  - Background_Color: 0 (white)
  - Connectivity: 4-connectivity (adjacency: up, down, left, right) seems implied for flood fill and object connection.
Transformation:
  - Step_1: Identify the single non-background object (color C, pixels P_obj).
  - Step_2: Identify enclosed background pixels (P_enclosed) by finding all background pixels (0) unreachable from the grid border via other background pixels (using 4-connectivity flood fill from borders).
  - Step_3: Create the base output grid by filling P_enclosed with color C on top of the original input grid.
  - Step_4: Check if P_obj forms a 'closed loop' around P_enclosed. A heuristic: check if *every* pixel in P_obj is adjacent (4-connectivity) to at least one pixel in P_enclosed.
  - Step_5: If a closed loop exists (Step 4 is true), set the P_obj pixels in the output grid to background color (0). Otherwise, leave them as color C.
