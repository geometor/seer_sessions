            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** Each input grid contains a background of white pixels (0) and a single connected object composed of a non-white color (orange, azure, magenta).\n2.  **Object Shapes:** The shapes vary: Example 1 is a 'Z' or 'S' shape, Example 2 is a 'C' shape, and Example 3 is another 'Z' or 'S' shape.\n3.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid transforms the input by filling an area related to the input object with the object's color. The background remains white.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation appears to involve identifying pixels \"enclosed\" by the input object and filling them.\n5.  **Enclosed Area Identification:** A key observation is how the \"enclosed\" area is determined. It seems to be the set of background pixels that cannot reach the grid's border without crossing the colored object pixels. This can be found using a flood fill starting from the border background pixels; any background pixels not reached are considered enclosed.\n6.  **Handling the Original Object Pixels:** There's a difference in how the original object's pixels are treated in the output:\n    *   In Examples 1 and 3 (the 'Z' shapes), the original object pixels remain part of the final colored shape in the output. The output is the union of the original object pixels and the enclosed pixels.\n    *   In Example 2 (the 'C' shape), the original object pixels are turned back into background pixels (0) in the output. The output consists *only* of the enclosed pixels.\n7.  **Distinguishing Factor:** The difference in handling the original pixels seems correlated with the shape of the input object. The 'C' shape forms a closed boundary around the enclosed area, whereas the 'Z' shapes do not completely enclose the filled area (the filled diamond extends beyond the concave parts of the 'Z'). A possible rule is: if the object fully surrounds the identified enclosed area (like the 'C'), remove the original object pixels; otherwise, keep them. This \"surrounding\" property might be tested by checking if all pixels of the original object are adjacent to the enclosed area.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Mark the locations corresponding to `ObjectPixels` as barriers, and all other locations initially as open (representing background).\n3.
