      description: A 2x2 block of four non-white pixels in the input grid.
      location: Centered within the input grid.
      pixels:
        - relative_position: top-left
        - relative_position: top-right
        - relative_position: bottom-left
        - relative_position: bottom-right
    - type: corner_pixels
      description: Four individual pixels located at the corners of the output grid.
      colors: Derived from the pixels in the input 2x2 block.
      location:
        - (0, 0) # top-left corner
        - (0, width-1) # top-right corner
        - (height-1, 0) # bottom-left corner
        - (height-1, width-1) # bottom-right corner
- relationships:
    - mapping: The pixel at the top-left of the input 2x2 block maps to the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
    - mapping: The pixel at the top-right of the input 2x2 block maps to the top-right corner (0, width-1) of the output grid.
    - mapping: The pixel at the bottom-left of the input 2x2 block maps to the bottom-left corner (height-1, 0) of the output grid.
    - mapping: The pixel at the bottom-right of the input 2x2 block maps to the bottom-right corner (height-1, width-1) of the output grid.
- actions:
    - identify: Locate the 2x2 block of non-white pixels in the input grid.
    - extract: Determine the colors and relative positions of the four pixels within this block.
    - create: Generate a new grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (white).
    - place: Move the extracted pixels to the corresponding corners of the new grid based on their relative position in the original 2x2 block.
