The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid but is entirely white except for the four corners. Each of the four non-white pixels from the input's central 2x2 block is moved to one of the four corners in the output grid. The relative positions are preserved: the top-left pixel of the input block moves to the top-left corner, the top-right pixel moves to the top-right corner, the bottom-left pixel moves to the bottom-left corner, and the bottom-right pixel moves to the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
