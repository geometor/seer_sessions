```python
import numpy as np

"""
Simulate gravity on non-white (non-zero) pixels in a grid. 
Non-white pixels fall downwards into white (zero) spaces until they hit another non-white pixel or the bottom boundary of the grid. 
The process repeats until no more pixels can fall, reaching a stable state. Objects (contiguous groups of same-colored non-white pixels) effectively maintain their shape while falling.
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies gravity to non-white pixels in the input grid.

    Args:
        input_grid (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A 2D list representing the grid after gravity simulation.
