## General Assessment

The previous code implemented a pixel-wise gravity simulation. However, the results show that this approach consistently fails across all training examples. The transformed outputs differ significantly from the expected outputs, particularly in the final positions and structural integrity of colored shapes.

The core issue seems to be that the transformation doesn't operate on individual pixels falling independently. Instead, the examples suggest that contiguous blocks of the same color (objects) maintain their shape and fall as single units. The falling stops when the *entire object* comes to rest, likely when any part of its bottom edge encounters another non-white pixel or the grid's bottom boundary.

The strategy will be to:
1.  Refine the object identification process.
2.  Implement a simulation where whole objects fall downwards.
3.  Determine the correct stopping condition for these falling objects.
4.  Iterate the falling process until a stable state is reached.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the objects and their movement. We'll use code to identify connected components (objects) in the input and compare their initial and final positions.
