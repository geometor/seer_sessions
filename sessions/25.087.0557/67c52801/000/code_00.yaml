observations:
  - task_type: object_manipulation
  - mechanic: gravity
  - elements:
      - type: grid
        description: A 2D array of pixels with integer values 0-9.
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: Represents different types (0=white/empty, 1-9=colored objects).
      - type: object
        description: A contiguous group of one or more pixels of the same non-white color.
        properties:
          - shape: The configuration of pixels forming the object.
          - color: The color value of the pixels in the object.
          - position: The coordinates of the pixels within the grid.
  - interactions:
      - gravity_effect:
          description: Non-white objects move downwards if the space below them is white (0).
          actor: non-white objects
          target: white space below
          condition: The entire space directly below the object's footprint must be white.
      - collision_stop:
          description: Downward movement stops when an object encounters another non-white pixel directly below any part of it.
          actor: falling object
          obstacle: non-white pixel below
      - boundary_stop:
          description: Downward movement stops when an object reaches the bottom row of the grid.
          actor: falling object
          obstacle: grid boundary (bottom row)
  - stability:
      description: The process repeats until no object can move further down, reaching a stable state.
      condition: No non-white object has only white pixels directly below it and is not already in the bottom row.
  - object_integrity:
      description: Objects maintain their shape and color during the falling process. They move as a single unit.
