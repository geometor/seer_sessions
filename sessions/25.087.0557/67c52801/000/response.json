Non-white objects (pixels with values 1-9) fall downwards until they encounter another non-white object directly below them or reach the bottom boundary of the grid. The white pixels (0) represent empty space through which objects can fall. Objects maintain their shape and color as they fall. The process continues iteratively until all objects have settled and no further downward movement is possible.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

If *all* pixels directly below the object's entire footprint are white (0) and the object is not already touching the bottom boundary of the grid, move the entire object down by one row.\n    c.
