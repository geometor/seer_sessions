Input_Grid:
  Contains_Colors: [white (0), red (2), green (3)]
  Size: Variable (height and width between 5 and 7 in examples)
  Relevant_Structures: Contiguous blocks of pixels, specifically solid 2x2 blocks.

Output_Grid:
  Contains_Colors: [white (0), blue (1)]
  Size: Fixed (3x3)
  Structure: Blue pixels appear only on the main diagonal, starting at (0,0).

Transformation:
  Action: Count specific objects in the input grid.
  Object_Type: Solid 2x2 blocks of green (3) pixels.
    - A 2x2 block is defined by four adjacent pixels forming a square: (r, c), (r+1, c), (r, c+1), (r+1, c+1).
    - All four pixels must be green (3).
  Mapping_to_Output:
    - The total count of green 2x2 blocks determines the number of blue (1) pixels in the output.
    - Let the count be 'N'.
    - Create a 3x3 grid initialized with white (0).
    - For 'i' from 0 to N-1 (inclusive, capped at 2 because the grid is 3x3):
        - Set the pixel at position (i, i) to blue (1).
