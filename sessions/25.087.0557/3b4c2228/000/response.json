            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Analysis:** The input grids vary in size and contain pixels of white (0), red (2), and green (3). The non-white pixels often form shapes, notably what appear to be 2x2 blocks, but also other configurations like L-shapes or single pixels.\n2.  **Output Grid Analysis:** The output grid is consistently a 3x3 grid. It contains only white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The blue pixels always appear along the main diagonal, starting from the top-left position (0,0).\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The number of blue pixels in the output grid seems to correlate with the presence of specific structures in the input grid. Let's test the hypothesis that the transformation counts the number of complete, solid 2x2 blocks of a specific color in the input.\n    *   Testing Red (2):\n        *   Example 1: 2 red blocks -> 2 blue pixels.\n        *   Example 2: 2 red blocks -> 1 blue pixel. (Hypothesis fails)\n    *   Testing Green (3):\n        *   Example 1: 2 green blocks -> 2 blue pixels. (Matches)\n        *   Example 2: 1 green block -> 1 blue pixel. (Matches)\n        *   Example 3: 3 green blocks -> 3 blue pixels. (Matches)\n        *   Example 4: 2 green blocks -> 2 blue pixels. (Matches)\n        *   Example 5: 1 green block -> 1 blue pixel. (Matches)\n4.  **Conclusion:** The transformation involves identifying and counting all occurrences of solid 2x2 blocks composed entirely of green (3) pixels within the input grid. The count determines the number of blue (1) pixels to be placed in the output grid. The output grid is always 3x3, and the blue pixels are placed sequentially along the main diagonal `(0,0), (1,1), (2,2)`, starting from the top-left, up to the total count found. All other positions in the output grid are filled with white (0).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each possible top-left corner `(row, col)` of a 2x2 block within the input grid. This means iterating `row` from 0 to `height - 2` and `col` from 0 to `width - 2`.\n3.  For each `(row, col)`, check if the pixels at `(row, col)`, `(row + 1, col)`, `(row, col + 1)`, and `(row + 1, col + 1)` are all green (3).\n4.  If all four pixels are green, increment `green_2x2_count`.\n5.  After checking all possible top-left corners, create a new 3x3 grid filled entirely with white (0) pixels.\n6.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `min(green_2x2_count, 3) - 1`. For each `i`, set the pixel at position `(i, i)` in the 3x3 output grid to blue (1).\n7.  Return the resulting 3x3 grid."
