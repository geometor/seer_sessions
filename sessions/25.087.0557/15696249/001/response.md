"""
Create a new 9x9 grid and initialize all its cells to white (0).
Examine the input 3x3 grid to find the first row (checking row 0, then row 1, then row 2) where all three pixels have the same color.
If such a uniform row is found at index `i`:
    Construct a 3x9 block by repeating the input 3x3 grid pattern three times horizontally.
    Copy this 3x9 block into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at row `i * 3` and column 0.
    Return the output grid.
If no uniform row is found after checking all rows:
    Examine the input 3x3 grid to find the first column (checking column 0, then column 1, then column 2) where all three pixels have the same color.
    If such a uniform column is found at index `j`:
        Construct a 9x3 block by repeating the input 3x3 grid pattern three times vertically.
        Copy this 9x3 block into the output grid, placing its top-left corner at row 0 and column `j * 3`.
        Return the output grid.
