            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Sizes:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This immediately suggests a transformation involving scaling, tiling, or embedding the input within a larger structure.\n2.  **Tiling Pattern:** Observing the outputs, the original 3x3 input pattern is replicated either horizontally three times (forming a 3x9 block) or vertically three times (forming a 9x3 block).\n3.  **Placement:** This tiled block (3x9 or 9x3) is then placed within the 9x9 output grid. The remaining cells of the 9x9 grid are filled with the background color, white (0).\n4.  **Conditional Logic:** The direction of tiling (horizontal vs. vertical) and the placement of the resulting block within the 9x9 grid appear to depend on a specific feature within the input grid.\n5.  **Identifying the Feature:** By comparing the inputs that lead to horizontal tiling (train\\_1, train\\_3) versus vertical tiling (train\\_2, train\\_4), a pattern emerges:\n    *   Inputs resulting in 1x3 horizontal tiling have at least one *row* where all three pixels share the same color.\n    *   Inputs resulting in 3x1 vertical tiling have at least one *column* where all three pixels share the same color (and no uniform rows, based on a row-first check).\n6.  **Placement Rule:**\n    *   If a uniform row is found at index `i` (0, 1, or 2), the 3x9 tiled block is placed starting at row `i * 3` and column 0 in the output grid.\n    *   If no uniform row exists, and a uniform column is found at index `j` (0, 1, or 2), the 9x3 tiled block is placed starting at row 0 and column `j * 3` in the output grid.\n7.  **Priority:** The examples imply a check for uniform rows first. If found, the row rule is applied. Only if no uniform row exists is a check for uniform columns performed.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
