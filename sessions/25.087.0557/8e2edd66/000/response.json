            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Sizes:** All input grids are 3x3, and all output grids are 9x9. This immediately suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width. The output grid can be seen as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks.\n2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses white (0) and one other color (maroon 9, azure 8, or orange 7). Let's call this the \"primary color\".\n3.  **Pattern Repetition:** The input grid itself seems to function as a \"pattern\" or \"stamp\".\n4.  **Mapping Logic:** Observing the relationship between input and output pixels:\n    *   Each cell in the 3x3 input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the 9x9 output grid.\n    *   If an input cell `(r, c)` contains the primary color, the *entire input grid pattern* is copied into the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid, starting at position `(r * 3, c * 3)`.\n    *   If an input cell `(r, c)` contains white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled entirely with white (0).\n5.  **Primary Color Identification:** The primary color is the single non-white color present in the input grid.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

That is, for each `i` from 0 to `H_in - 1` and `j` from 0 to `W_in - 1`, set `output_grid[out_r + i][out_c + j] = pattern_grid[i][j]`.\n    b.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is white (0), do nothing (the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid remains white as initialized).\n7.  Return the completed output grid."
