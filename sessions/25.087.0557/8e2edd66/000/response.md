Okay, let's analyze the task examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Sizes:** All input grids are 3x3, and all output grids are 9x9. This immediately suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width. The output grid can be seen as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks.
2.  **Color Usage:** Each example uses white (0) and one other color (maroon 9, azure 8, or orange 7). Let's call this the "primary color".
3.  **Pattern Repetition:** The input grid itself seems to function as a "pattern" or "stamp".
4.  **Mapping Logic:** Observing the relationship between input and output pixels:
    *   Each cell in the 3x3 input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the 9x9 output grid.
    *   If an input cell `(r, c)` contains the primary color, the *entire input grid pattern* is copied into the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid, starting at position `(r * 3, c * 3)`.
    *   If an input cell `(r, c)` contains white (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled entirely with white (0).
5.  **Primary Color Identification:** The primary color is the single non-white color present in the input grid.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_scaling:
    - input_dimensions: [3, 3]
    - output_dimensions: [9, 9]
    - scale_factor: 3
  grid_structure:
    - output_grid: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 3x3 blocks.
    - mapping: Each input cell corresponds to one 3x3 block in the output grid.
  color_palette:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - primary_color: The single non-white color present in the input grid (e.g., maroon, azure, orange).
objects:
  - object: input_grid
    attributes:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - content: defines the primary_color and the pattern_grid

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Determine the height (`H_in`) and width (`W_in`) of the input grid.
2.  Create a new output grid with height `H_out = H_in * 3` and width `W_out = W_in * 3`. Initialize all cells of the output grid to white (0).
3.  Identify the single non-white color present in the input grid; this is the `primary_color`.
4.  Define the `pattern_grid` as being identical to the input grid.
5.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to `H_in - 1`) and column index `c` (from 0 to `W_in - 1`).
6.  For each input cell `input_grid[r][c]`:
    a.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is equal to the `primary_color`:
        i.  Calculate the top-left corner coordinates for the corresponding block in the output grid: `out_r = r * 3`, `out_c = c * 3`.
        ii. Copy the `pattern_grid` into the output grid, starting at `(out_r, out_c)`. That is, for each `i` from 0 to `H_in - 1` and `j` from 0 to `W_in - 1`, set `output_grid[out_r + i][out_c + j] = pattern_grid[i][j]`.
    b.  If `input_grid[r][c]` is white (0), do nothing (the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid remains white as initialized).
7.  Return the completed output grid.
