task_context:
  grid_scaling:
    - input_dimensions: [3, 3]
    - output_dimensions: [9, 9]
    - scale_factor: 3
  grid_structure:
    - output_grid: Composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 3x3 blocks.
    - mapping: Each input cell corresponds to one 3x3 block in the output grid.
  color_palette:
    - background_color: white (0)
    - primary_color: The single non-white color present in the input grid (e.g., maroon, azure, orange).
objects:
  - object: input_grid
    attributes:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - content: defines the primary_color and the pattern_grid
  - object: output_grid
    attributes:
      - dimensions: [9, 9]
      - content: initially all white (0), then selectively filled
  - object: pattern_grid
    attributes:
      - source: identical to the input_grid
      - role: used as a stamp or template
  - object: primary_color_pixels
    attributes:
      - location: cells in the input_grid containing the primary_color
      - role: triggers the placement of the pattern_grid in the output
  - object: white_pixels
    attributes:
      - location: cells in the input_grid containing white (0)
      - role: correspond to all-white blocks in the output
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_grid cell (r, c)
    to: output_grid block starting at (r * 3, c * 3)
  - type: conditional_copy
    condition: input_grid cell (r, c) contains the primary_color
    action: copy pattern_grid to the corresponding output_grid block
  - type: fill
    condition: input_grid cell (r, c) contains white (0)
    action: fill the corresponding output_grid block with white (0)
