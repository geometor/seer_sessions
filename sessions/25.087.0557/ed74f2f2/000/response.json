            "text": "**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 5x9, while the output grids are always 3x3.\n2.  **Colors:** Inputs use white (0) and gray (5). Outputs use white (0), blue (1), red (2), and green (3).\n3.  **Structure:** The input grids feature two distinct 3x3 regions containing gray patterns, separated by a vertical white column. These regions are located at rows 1-3, columns 1-3 (Left Pattern) and rows 1-3, columns 5-7 (Right Pattern). The surrounding area is white.\n4.  **Transformation Core Idea:** The transformation appears to use the Left Pattern to determine a specific color (blue, red, or green) and then uses the Right Pattern as a template or mask to draw the output grid using that determined color and white.\n5.  **Left Pattern Role:** The specific arrangement of gray pixels within the Left Pattern seems to act as a key or identifier that maps to one of the output colors (1, 2, or 3).\n    *   Pattern `[[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]]` corresponds to Blue (1).\n    *   Pattern `[[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]]` corresponds to Red (2).\n    *   Pattern `[[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]]` corresponds to Green (3).\n6.  **Right Pattern Role:** The Right Pattern acts as a direct mask for the output. Where the Right Pattern has a gray pixel (5), the output grid has the Characteristic Color determined by the Left Pattern. Where the Right Pattern has a white pixel (0), the output grid has a white pixel (0).\n7.  **Output Generation:** The output 3x3 grid is essentially a copy of the Right Pattern, but with the gray pixels replaced by the Characteristic Color determined by the Left Pattern.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
