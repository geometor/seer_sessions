task_context:
  - description: The task involves interpreting two 3x3 patterns embedded within a larger input grid to generate a 3x3 output grid.
  - input_grid_size: 5x9
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_colors: [0 (white), 5 (gray)]
  - output_colors: [0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green)]

identified_objects:
  - object: Left Pattern
    description: A 3x3 subgrid located at rows 1-3, columns 1-3 of the input grid. Contains patterns of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Acts as a key to determine the 'Characteristic Color' for the output.
  - object: Right Pattern
    description: A 3x3 subgrid located at rows 1-3, columns 5-7 of the input grid. Contains patterns of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Acts as a mask or template for the output grid structure.
  - object: Characteristic Color
    description: A single color (blue, red, or green) determined for each input example.
    relationship: Determined by the specific pattern of the Left Pattern object.
  - object: Output Grid
    description: The final 3x3 grid produced by the transformation.
    relationship: Its structure mirrors the Right Pattern, with gray pixels replaced by the Characteristic Color and white pixels remaining white.

transformation_rules:
  - step: 1
    action: Extract the Left Pattern (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) and Right Pattern (rows 1-3, cols 5-7) from the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify the Characteristic Color based on the Left Pattern configuration.
    conditions:
      - if Left Pattern is [[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]], Characteristic Color is 1 (blue).
      - if Left Pattern is [[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]], Characteristic Color is 2 (red).
      - if Left Pattern is [[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]], Characteristic Color is 3 (green).
  - step: 3
    action: Create the 3x3 output grid by iterating through the Right Pattern.
    details: For each position (i, j): if Right Pattern[i, j] is 5 (gray), set Output[i, j] to the Characteristic Color; otherwise, set Output[i, j] to 0 (white).

example_specific_details:
  - example: train_1
    left_pattern: [[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]]
    right_pattern: [[5,5,5],[5,0,5],[5,0,5]]
    characteristic_color: 2 (red)
    output: [[2,2,2],[2,0,2],[2,0,2]]
  - example: train_2
    left_pattern: [[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]]
    right_pattern: [[5,0,5],[5,0,5],[5,5,0]]
    characteristic_color: 3 (green)
    output: [[3,0,3],[3,0,3],[3,3,0]]
  - example: train_3
    left_pattern: [[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]]
    right_pattern: [[5,0,5],[0,5,5],[5,0,5]]
    characteristic_color: 1 (blue)
    output: [[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
