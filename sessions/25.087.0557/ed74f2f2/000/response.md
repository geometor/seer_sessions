**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Dimensions:** The input grids are consistently 5x9, while the output grids are always 3x3.
2.  **Colors:** Inputs use white (0) and gray (5). Outputs use white (0), blue (1), red (2), and green (3).
3.  **Structure:** The input grids feature two distinct 3x3 regions containing gray patterns, separated by a vertical white column. These regions are located at rows 1-3, columns 1-3 (Left Pattern) and rows 1-3, columns 5-7 (Right Pattern). The surrounding area is white.
4.  **Transformation Core Idea:** The transformation appears to use the Left Pattern to determine a specific color (blue, red, or green) and then uses the Right Pattern as a template or mask to draw the output grid using that determined color and white.
5.  **Left Pattern Role:** The specific arrangement of gray pixels within the Left Pattern seems to act as a key or identifier that maps to one of the output colors (1, 2, or 3).
    *   Pattern `[[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]]` corresponds to Blue (1).
    *   Pattern `[[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]]` corresponds to Red (2).
    *   Pattern `[[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]]` corresponds to Green (3).
6.  **Right Pattern Role:** The Right Pattern acts as a direct mask for the output. Where the Right Pattern has a gray pixel (5), the output grid has the Characteristic Color determined by the Left Pattern. Where the Right Pattern has a white pixel (0), the output grid has a white pixel (0).
7.  **Output Generation:** The output 3x3 grid is essentially a copy of the Right Pattern, but with the gray pixels replaced by the Characteristic Color determined by the Left Pattern.

```yaml
task_context:
  - description: The task involves interpreting two 3x3 patterns embedded within a larger input grid to generate a 3x3 output grid.
  - input_grid_size: 5x9
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_colors: [0 (white), 5 (gray)]
  - output_colors: [0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green)]

identified_objects:
  - object: Left Pattern
    description: A 3x3 subgrid located at rows 1-3, columns 1-3 of the input grid. Contains patterns of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Acts as a key to determine the 'Characteristic Color' for the output.
  - object: Right Pattern
    description: A 3x3 subgrid located at rows 1-3, columns 5-7 of the input grid. Contains patterns of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
    role: Acts as a mask or template for the output grid structure.
  - object: Characteristic Color
    description: A single color (blue, red, or green) determined for each input example.
    relationship: Determined by the specific pattern of the Left Pattern object.
  - object: Output Grid
    description: The final 3x3 grid produced by the transformation.
    relationship: Its structure mirrors the Right Pattern, with gray pixels replaced by the Characteristic Color and white pixels remaining white.

transformation_rules:
  - step: 1
    action: Extract the Left Pattern (rows 1-3, cols 1-3) and Right Pattern (rows 1-3, cols 5-7) from the input grid.
  - step: 2
    action: Identify the Characteristic Color based on the Left Pattern configuration.
    conditions:
      - if Left Pattern is [[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]], Characteristic Color is 1 (blue).
      - if Left Pattern is [[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]], Characteristic Color is 2 (red).
      - if Left Pattern is [[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]], Characteristic Color is 3 (green).
  - step: 3
    action: Create the 3x3 output grid by iterating through the Right Pattern.
    details: For each position (i, j): if Right Pattern[i, j] is 5 (gray), set Output[i, j] to the Characteristic Color; otherwise, set Output[i, j] to 0 (white).

  - example: train_1
    left_pattern: [[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]]
    right_pattern: [[5,5,5],[5,0,5],[5,0,5]]
    characteristic_color: 2 (red)
    output: [[2,2,2],[2,0,2],[2,0,2]]
  - example: train_2

    right_pattern: [[5,0,5],[0,5,5],[5,0,5]]
    characteristic_color: 1 (blue)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify and isolate the 3x3 subgrid located at rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 of the input grid; this is the "Left Pattern".
2.  Identify and isolate the 3x3 subgrid located at rows 1-3 and columns 5-7 of the input grid; this is the "Right Pattern".
3.  Determine the "Characteristic Color" by matching the Left Pattern against known configurations:
    *   If the Left Pattern matches the configuration `[[5,5,5],[0,5,0],[0,5,0]]`, set the Characteristic Color to 1 (blue).
    *   If the Left Pattern matches the configuration `[[5,5,0],[0,5,0],[0,5,5]]`, set the Characteristic Color to 2 (red).
    *   If the Left Pattern matches the configuration `[[0,5,5],[0,5,0],[5,5,0]]`, set the Characteristic Color to 3 (green
