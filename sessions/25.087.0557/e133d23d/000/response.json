White (0) in the input seems related to white (0) in the output.\n    *   Comparing the left 3x3 section (containing magenta) and the right 3x3 section (containing azure) of the input grid with the 3x3 output grid suggests a pixel-wise combination rule.\n    *   Specifically, it appears that if a cell in the left section is magenta OR the corresponding cell in the right section is azure, the resulting cell in the output grid is red. Otherwise, it's white.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"

Define the 'right subgrid' as the rectangular region of the input grid to the right of the yellow separator column. (Both subgrids will have the same dimensions).\n4.
