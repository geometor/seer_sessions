            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Format:** The input is always a 2x12 grid containing white (0) and red (2) pixels.\n2.  **Output Format:** The output is always an 8x7 grid containing white (0), red (2), and a single green (3) pixel.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The task involves interpreting a code embedded in the input grid to determine which digit shape (from 1 to 4, as seen in the examples) to draw in the output grid.\n4.  **Input Encoding:** The pattern of red pixels in the first four columns of the input grid uniquely identifies the digit to be drawn. Each column can be viewed as a pair of values `(top_row_pixel, bottom_row_pixel)`. The sequence of these pairs for columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 acts as the identifier.\n5.  **Output Structure:** The output grid has a fixed background (white), a fixed marker pixel (green at row 0, column 3), and a variable shape drawn in red.\n6.  **Output Shapes:** The red shapes correspond to stylized representations of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, constructed from block segments within the 8x7 grid. The specific coordinates for each digit's red pixels are consistent across examples representing the same digit.\n7.  **Irrelevant Input Data?**: The input columns from index 4 to 11 do not seem necessary to determine the output shape, suggesting the core information is concentrated at the beginning of the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
