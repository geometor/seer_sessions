Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to the pixels at the same column and relative row within each of the four input blocks.\n5.  **Color Interaction:** The core transformation involves determining the output pixel's color based on the colors present at the corresponding locations in the four input blocks. There appears to be a priority system determining which color \"wins\" if multiple non-white colors are present at the corresponding locations.\n6.  **Priority Rule:** By comparing inputs and outputs, a specific priority order emerges: Gray (5) has the highest priority, followed by Yellow (4), then Azure (8), and finally Red (2). If none of these colors are present at the corresponding locations, the output is White (0).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each cell of the output grid using its row index `r` (from 0 to 2) and column index `c` (from 0 to 5).\n3.  For the current output cell `(r, c)`, identify the four corresponding cells in the input grid:\n    *   `cell_G`: Input cell at `(r, c)` (within the first 3x6 block).\n    *   `cell_Y`: Input cell at `(r + 3, c)` (within the second 3x6 block).\n    *   `cell_R`: Input cell at `(r + 6, c)` (within the third 3x6 block).\n    *   `cell_A`: Input cell at `(r + 9, c)` (within the fourth 3x6 block).\n4.  Check the color values of these four input cells according to a specific priority order:\n    a.  Check if `cell_G` contains Gray (5). If yes, set the output cell `(r, c)` to Gray (5) and proceed to the next output cell.\n    b.  If not, check if `cell_Y` contains Yellow (4). If yes, set the output cell `(r, c)` to Yellow (4) and proceed to the next output cell.\n    c.  If not, check if `cell_A` contains Azure (8). If yes, set the output cell `(r, c)` to Azure (8) and proceed to the next output cell.\n    d.  If not, check if `cell_R` contains Red (2). If yes, set the output cell `(r, c)` to Red (2) and proceed to the next output cell.\n    e.  If none of the above conditions are met (meaning all corresponding input cells were White or did not match their priority check order), leave the output cell `(r, c)` as White (0).\n5.  After iterating through all output cells, return the completed 3x6 output grid."
