Okay, let's break down the transformation process for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Size:** The input grids are consistently 3x3, and the output grids are consistently 9x9. This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.
2.  **Tiling Pattern:** The output grid appears to be composed of nine 3x3 subgrids.
3.  **Subgrid Relationship to Input:** Each 3x3 subgrid in the output seems to be a transformed version of the original 3x3 input grid.
4.  **Transformations:** By comparing the subgrids to the input, we can identify specific transformations:
    *   The central subgrid (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) is identical to the input grid.
    *   The subgrids adjacent horizontally to the center (middle-left and middle-right) are the input grid flipped horizontally.
    *   The subgrids adjacent vertically to the center (top-middle and bottom-middle) are the input grid flipped vertically.
    *   The four corner subgrids (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).
5.  **Symmetry:** The arrangement of these transformed subgrids exhibits symmetry. It's symmetric by reflection across the central row and the central column.

## Facts


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input_properties:
  - type: 2D grid
  - dimensions: NxN (examples use 3x3)
  - elements: integers 0-9 (colors)
output_properties:
  - type: 2D grid
  - dimensions: 3N x 3N (examples use 9x9)
  - elements: integers 0-9 (colors)
transformation:
  name: tiling_with_reflections
  steps:
    - define input grid as 'I'
    - generate transformed grids:
        - 'Ih': flip 'I' horizontally
        - 'Iv': flip 'I' vertically
        - 'Ihv': flip 'I' horizontally and vertically
    - construct output grid as a 3x3 arrangement of subgrids:
        - subgrid at (0,0): 'Ihv'
        - subgrid at (0,1): 'Iv'
        - subgrid at (0,2): 'Ihv'
        - subgrid at (1,0): 'Ih'
        - subgrid at (1,1): 'I'
        - subgrid at (1,2): 'Ih'
        - subgrid at (2,0): 'Ihv'
        - subgrid at (2,1): 'Iv'
        - subgrid at (2,2): 'Ihv'
  output_size_relation: output dimensions = 3 * input dimensions
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Let the input grid be denoted as `I`.
2.  Calculate three modified versions of `I`:
    a.  Flip `I` horizontally to create grid `Ih`.
    b.  Flip `I` vertically to create grid `Iv`.
    c.  Flip `I` both horizontally and vertically (or rotate 180 degrees) to create grid `Ihv`.
3.  Create a new output grid that is three times the height and three times the width of `I`.
4.  Tile the output grid with 3x3 blocks using `I`, `Ih`, `Iv`, and `Ihv` in the following pattern:
    
```
    Top Row:    [Ihv] [Iv] [Ihv]
    Middle Row: [Ih]  [I]  [Ih]
    Bottom Row: [Ihv] [Iv] [Ihv]
    ```

5.  Return the resulting tiled grid.
