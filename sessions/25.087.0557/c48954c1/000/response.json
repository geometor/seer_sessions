This suggests a scaling factor of 3 in both height and width.\n2.  **Tiling Pattern:** The output grid appears to be composed of nine 3x3 subgrids.\n3.  **Subgrid Relationship to Input:** Each 3x3 subgrid in the output seems to be a transformed version of the original 3x3 input grid.\n4.  **Transformations:** By comparing the subgrids to the input, we can identify specific transformations:\n    *   The central subgrid (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) is identical to the input grid.\n    *   The subgrids adjacent horizontally to the center (middle-left and middle-right) are the input grid flipped horizontally.\n    *   The subgrids adjacent vertically to the center (top-middle and bottom-middle) are the input grid flipped vertically.\n    *   The four corner subgrids (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are the input grid flipped both horizontally and vertically (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation).\n5.  **Symmetry:** The arrangement of these transformed subgrids exhibits symmetry. It's symmetric by reflection across the central row and the central column.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
