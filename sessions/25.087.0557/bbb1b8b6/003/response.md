"""
Identifies two 4x4 subgrids (L and R) in the 4x9 input grid, separated by a gray column.
Counts non-white pixels in each subgrid (count_L, count_R).
Determines the output 4x4 grid based on the comparison of count_L and count_R:
- If count_L >= count_R: Overlay L onto R (start with R, replace with non-white pixels from L).
- If count_R > count_L:
    - If count_R - count_L == 1: Output is L.
    - If count_R - count_L > 1: Overlay R onto L (start with L, replace with non-white pixels from R).

    Creates a copy of the base_grid. Then, for each pixel in the top_grid,
