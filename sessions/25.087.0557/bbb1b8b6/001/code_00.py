Identify the input grid, which is expected to be 4x9.
Locate the vertical gray separator line in the 5th column (index 4).
Define the left_subgrid as the 4x4 area covering columns 0 to 3.
Define the right_subgrid as the 4x4 area covering columns 5 to 8.
Count the number of non-white pixels (value != 0) in the left_subgrid (left_count).

Compare left_count and right_count.
If left_count is greater than right_count, the output grid is the left_subgrid.
Otherwise (if right_count is greater than or equal to left_count), the output grid is the right_subgrid.
