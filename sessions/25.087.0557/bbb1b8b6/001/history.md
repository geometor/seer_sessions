**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids consistently have dimensions 4x9. They feature a vertical line of gray pixels (color 5) in the 5th column (index 4). This gray line acts as a visual separator.
2.  **Subgrids:** The gray line effectively divides the input grid into two 4x4 subgrids:
    *   `left_grid`: Consists of columns 0 through 3.
    *   `right_grid`: Consists of columns 5 through 8.
3.  **Content:** Both the `left_grid` and `right_grid` contain patterns composed of various colors against a white (color 0) background.
4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids always have dimensions 4x4.
5.  **Transformation:** The output grid is identical to either the `left_grid` or the `right_grid` from the corresponding input grid.
6.  **Selection Logic:** The choice between the `left_grid` and `right_grid` appears to depend on the number of non-white pixels within each subgrid. The subgrid containing the *larger* number of non-white pixels is selected as the output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the input grid.
2.  Locate the vertical gray separator line in the 5th column (index 4).
3.  Define the `left_subgrid` as the 4x4 area covering columns 0 to 3 of the input grid.
4.  Define the `right_subgrid` as the 4x4 area covering columns 5 to 8 of the input grid.
5.  Count the number of pixels in the `left_subgrid` that are *not* white (value 0). Let this count be `left_count`.
6.  Count the number of pixels in the `right_subgrid` that are *not* white (value 0). Let this count be `right_count`.
7.  Compare `left_count` and `right_count`.
8.  If `left_count` is greater than `right_count`, the output grid is the `left_subgrid`.
9.  Otherwise (if `right_count` is greater than or equal to `left_count`), the output grid is the `right_subgrid`.
