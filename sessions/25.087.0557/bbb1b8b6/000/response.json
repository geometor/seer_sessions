They feature a vertical line of gray pixels (color 5) in the 5th column (index 4). This gray line acts as a visual separator.\n2.  **Subgrids:** The gray line effectively divides the input grid into two 4x4 subgrids:\n    *   `left_grid`: Consists of columns 0 through 3.\n    *   `right_grid`: Consists of columns 5 through 8.\n3.  **Content:** Both the `left_grid` and `right_grid` contain patterns composed of various colors against a white (color 0) background.\n4.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids always have dimensions 4x4.\n5.  **Transformation:** The output grid is identical to either the `left_grid` or the `right_grid` from the corresponding input grid.\n6.  **Selection Logic:** The choice between the `left_grid` and `right_grid` appears to depend on the number of non-white pixels within each subgrid. The subgrid containing the *larger* number of non-white pixels is selected as the output.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
