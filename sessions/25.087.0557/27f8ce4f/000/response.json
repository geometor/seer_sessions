All outputs are 9x9 grids.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The 9x9 output grid appears to be structured as a 3x3 super-grid, where each cell of the super-grid is itself a 3x3 block.\n3.  **Content:** These 3x3 blocks in the output grid are either exact copies of the original 3x3 input grid or are filled entirely with the 'white' color (0).\n4.  **Pattern Determination:** The placement of the input grid copies within the output super-grid seems to be determined by the content of the input grid itself. Specifically, it looks like a particular color within the input grid acts as a \"trigger\".\n5.  **Trigger Color:** By analyzing the examples, the color that appears most frequently in the input grid dictates where copies of the input are placed in the output. If a cell `(r, c)` in the input grid contains this most frequent color, then the corresponding 3x3 block at `(r*3, c*3)` to `(r*3+2, c*3+2)` in the output grid is filled with a copy of the input grid. Otherwise, that 3x3 block in the output is filled with 'white' (0).\n6.  **Tie-breaking (Assumption):** No examples show a tie for the most frequent color. If a tie were to occur, a rule would be needed. A common default is to choose the color with the lowest numerical index among the tied colors.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the color that occurs most frequently. This is the \"trigger color\". (If there is a tie for the most frequent color, choose the color with the smallest number among the tied colors).\n3.  Create a new 9x9 grid and fill it completely with 'white' (color 0).\n4.  Look at each cell in the original 3x3 input grid, checking its row `r` (0, 1, or 2) and column `c` (0, 1, or 2).\n5.  If the color in the input cell at `(r, c)` is the same as the \"trigger color\" you identified in step 2, then copy the *entire* original 3x3 input grid into the 9x9 output grid, starting at the position `(row = r * 3, column = c * 3)`.\n6.  If the color in the input cell at `(r, c)` is *not* the trigger color, leave the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid (from `row = r * 3` to `r * 3 + 2`, and `column = c * 3` to `c * 3 + 2`) filled with 'white'.\n7.  The resulting 9x9 grid is the final output."
