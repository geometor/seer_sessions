InputGrid:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: 3
    width: 3
    pixels: colors 0-9
OutputGrid:
  type: grid
  properties:
    height: 9
    width: 9
    pixels: colors 0-9
    structure: 3x3 super-grid of 3x3 blocks
Transformation:
  - Step: Analyze Input Grid
    - Action: Count frequency of each non-white (1-9) color.
    - Result: Frequency map of colors.
  - Step: Determine Trigger Color
    - Action: Find the color with the maximum frequency in the frequency map.
    - Tie-breaking (Assumption): If multiple colors share the maximum frequency, select the one with the lowest color index.
    - Result: The Trigger Color.
  - Step: Construct Output Grid
    - Action: Initialize a 9x9 grid with 'white' (0).
    - Action: Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the 3x3 Input Grid.
    - Condition: If the color at InputGrid[r][c] matches the Trigger Color:
      - Action: Copy the entire 3x3 Input Grid into the Output Grid, placing its top-left corner at OutputGrid[r*3][c*3].
    - Condition: Otherwise (color does not match Trigger Color):
      - Action: The corresponding 3x3 block in the Output Grid remains 'white' (0).
    - Result: The final 9x9 Output Grid.
Relationship:
  - The input grid defines both the pattern (via its most frequent color) and the content (the 3x3 block to be copied) for the output grid.
  - The position (r, c) of a trigger color in the input grid maps directly to the position (super-grid cell R=r, C=c) where a copy of the input is placed in the output grid.
