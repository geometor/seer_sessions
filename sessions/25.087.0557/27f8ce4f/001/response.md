1.  Examine the 3x3 input grid and count how many times each color (from 1 to 9) appears.
2.  Identify the color that occurs most frequently. This is the "trigger color". (If there is a tie for the most frequent color, choose the color with the smallest number among the tied colors).
3.  Create a new 9x9 grid and fill it completely with 'white' (color 0).
4.  Look at each cell in the original 3x3 input grid, checking its row `r` (0, 1, or 2) and column `c` (0, 1, or 2).
5.  If the color in the input cell at `(r, c)` is the same as the "trigger color" you identified in step 2, then copy the *entire* original 3x3 input grid into the 9x9 output grid, starting at the position `(row = r * 3, column = c * 3)`.
6.  If the color in the input cell at `(r, c)` is *not* the trigger color, leave the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid (from `row = r * 3` to `r * 3 + 2`, and `column = c * 3` to `c * 3 + 2`) filled with 'white'.
7.  The resulting 9x9 grid is the final output.
