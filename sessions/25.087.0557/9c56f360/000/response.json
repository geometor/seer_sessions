            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output are 2D grids of pixels with varying dimensions.\n2.  **Colors**: The primary colors involved are White (0), Azure (8), and Green (3).\n3.  **Transformation Focus**: The core transformation involves the movement of Green (3) pixels. White (0) and Azure (8) pixels appear static and unchanged in their positions between input and output.\n4.  **Green Pixel Movement**: Green pixels shift their position horizontally towards the left.\n5.  **Movement Condition**: A Green pixel moves one step to the left only if the cell immediately to its left is White (0).\n6.  **Movement Extent**: The movement is iterative or continuous. A Green pixel keeps moving leftwards, one cell at a time, as long as the cell immediately to its left remains White (0).\n7.  **Barriers**: The movement of a Green pixel stops if it reaches the left edge of the grid (column 0) or if the cell immediately to its left contains a non-White color (in these examples, Azure (8)).\n8.  **Trail**: When a Green pixel moves from a cell, that cell becomes White (0).\n9.  **Simultaneity/Order**: All Green pixels appear to undergo this movement process. The examples suggest that the final state is reached when no more Green pixels can move left into a White cell. This could be modeled as an iterative process that repeats until the grid stabilizes.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Check the color of the cell immediately to its left.\n    b.  If the cell is within the grid boundaries (i.e., not already in column 0) AND the cell to the left contains White (0):\n        i.  Change the color of the cell to the left to Green (3).\n        ii. Change the color of the current cell (the original Green pixel location) to White (0).\n        iii. Record that a move occurred in this iteration.\n5.  If, after scanning the entire grid, at least one move occurred, repeat the process from step 3.\n6.  If a full scan of the grid completes with no Green pixels moving, the process terminates.\n7.  The final state of the grid is the output."
