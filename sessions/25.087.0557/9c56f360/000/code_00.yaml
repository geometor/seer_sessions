elements:
  - element: grid
    attributes:
      - type: 2D array
      - cell_colors: [White (0), Azure (8), Green (3)]
  - element: pixel
    attributes:
      - color: White (0)
        role: empty space, destination for movement, replaces moved green pixels
      - color: Azure (8)
        role: static obstacle, blocks green pixel movement
      - color: Green (3)
        role: mobile element, moves leftward

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    nodes: [Green pixel, adjacent cell to the left]
    condition: adjacent cell is White (0)
    action: Green pixel moves into the adjacent cell

transformation:
  - action: move
    actor: Green pixel
    direction: left
    condition: cell immediately to the left is White (0)
    effect:
      - Green pixel occupies the left cell
      - Original cell of the Green pixel becomes White (0)
    termination:
      - Green pixel reaches column 0
      - Cell immediately to the left is non-White (Azure (8) in examples)
  - scope: applies iteratively to all Green pixels until no more moves are possible in a full pass over the grid.
