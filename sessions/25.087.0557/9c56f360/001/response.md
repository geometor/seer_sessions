import numpy as np

"""
Transforms the input grid by iteratively moving Green (3) pixels one step to the left, 
if and only if the cell immediately to the left is White (0). 
This process repeats for all Green pixels until no more Green pixels can move left 
into a White cell in a full pass over the grid. 
When a Green pixel moves, its original position becomes White (0). 
Movement stops if a Green pixel reaches the left edge (column 0) or if the cell 
to its left is not White (0) (e.g., it's Azure (8) or another Green (3)).
