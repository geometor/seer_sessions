The output grids are consistently 3 rows by 5 columns. This implies a transformation that reduces the number of rows by half while preserving the width.\n2.  **Color Palettes:**\n    *   Inputs use: white (0), yellow (4), and maroon (9).\n    *   Outputs use: white (0) and magenta (6).\n3.  **Input Structure:** The input grids appear vertically partitioned. The top 3 rows contain only maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The bottom 3 rows contain only yellow (4) and white (0) pixels. Each partition has the same dimensions as the output grid (3x5).\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid seems to be generated by comparing the top half of the input grid with the bottom half, element by element at corresponding positions.\n    *   Let's denote the top half (rows 0-2) as `Top` and the bottom half (rows 3-5) as `Bottom`.\n    *   Consider a position `(r, c)` where `0 <= r < 3` and `0 <= c < 5`.\n    *   Compare the pixel value `Top[r][c]` with `Bottom[r][c]`.\n    *   If `Top[r][c]` is maroon (9) and `Bottom[r][c]` is white (0), the output `Output[r][c]` is magenta (6).\n    *   If `Top[r][c]` is white (0) and `Bottom[r][c]` is yellow (4), the output `Output[r][c]` is magenta (6).\n    *   If `Top[r][c]` is maroon (9) and `Bottom[r][c]` is yellow (4), the output `Output[r][c]` is white (0).\n    *   If `Top[r][c]` is white (0) and `Bottom[r][c]` is white (0), the output `Output[r][c]` is white (0).\n5.  **Core Logic:** This behavior is equivalent to a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation. If we consider non-white pixels (maroon or yellow) as 'True' and white pixels (0) as 'False', the output is magenta (6) when the XOR result is 'True' (one input is True, the other is False), and white (0) when the XOR result is 'False' (both inputs are True or both are False).\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Conceptually divide the input grid into two 3x5 subgrids: the \"Top Half\" (rows 0, 1, 2) and the \"Bottom Half\" (rows 3, 4, 5).\n3.  Create a new output grid with dimensions 3x5, initializing all cells to white (0).\n4.  Iterate through each cell position using row index `r` from 0 to 2 and column index `c` from 0 to 4.\n5.  For the current position `(r, c)`:\n    a.  Get the pixel value from the Top Half: `top_pixel = InputGrid[r][c]`.\n    b.  Get the pixel value from the Bottom Half: `bottom_pixel = InputGrid[r + 3][c]`.\n    c.  Determine if the `top_pixel` is non-white (i.e., is maroon/9).\n    d.  Determine if the `bottom_pixel` is non-white (i.e., is yellow/4).\n    e.  If exactly one of the two pixels (`top_pixel`, `bottom_pixel`) is non-white, set the corresponding cell in the output grid `OutputGrid[r][c]` to magenta (6).\n    f.  Otherwise (if both pixels are white, or if both pixels are non-white), set the corresponding cell in the output grid `OutputGrid[r][c]` to white (0).\n6.  After iterating through all positions, the resulting output grid is the final answer."
