*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming an input grid containing a single azure (8) object and several yellow (4) pixels into an output grid. The output grid consists of repetitions of a 3x3 pattern derived from the input azure object. The number of repetitions is determined by the count of yellow pixels in the input. The background is white (0). The core transformation seems to be extracting a shape, counting markers, and tiling the shape based on the count.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Input_Grid:
      - Contains_Objects:
          - Object: Azure_Shape
            Color: 8 (azure)
            Quantity: 1
            Contiguous: Yes
            Properties:
              - Shape: Variable, often L-like or smaller variations.
              - Size: Variable bounding box.
          - Object: Yellow_Markers
            Color: 4 (yellow)
            Quantity: N (variable, 1 to 4 in examples)
            Contiguous: No (individual pixels)
            Properties:
              - Size: 1x1 pixel each.
          - Object: Background
            Color: 0 (white)
            Quantity: Fills remaining space.

    Output_Grid:
      - Contains_Objects:
          - Object: Tiled_Pattern
            Color: 8 (azure) and 0 (white)
            Quantity: 1 (composite object)
            Properties:
              - Structure: Horizontal tiling of a base 3x3 pattern.
              - Base_Pattern: Derived from the input Azure_Shape.
              - Repetitions: Equal to N (count of Yellow_Markers in input).
              - Dimensions: 3 rows, 3 * N columns.
          - Object: Background
            Color: 0 (white)
            Quantity: Fills parts of the Base_Pattern.

    Transformation:
      - Action: Identify the single contiguous Azure_Shape in the input.
      - Action: Determine the minimal bounding box of the Azure_Shape.
      - Action: Extract the grid content within the bounding box (raw_pattern).
      - Action: Create a target 3x3 pattern grid (initialized to white/0).
      - Action: Place the raw_pattern into the 3x3 target pattern grid, aligning the raw_pattern's bottom-left corner with the target pattern's bottom-left corner (padding with white/0 if raw_pattern is smaller than 3x3). If raw_pattern is larger than 3x3, it implies cropping, likely keeping the bottom-left 3x3 portion (though not observed in examples). Let the result be the Base_Pattern.
      - Action: Count the number of Yellow_Markers (N) in the input grid.
      - Action: Construct the output grid by tiling the 3x3 Base_Pattern horizontally N times.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Locate the single contiguous object composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
    2.  Determine the minimal bounding box that encloses this azure object.
    3.  Extract the subgrid corresponding to this bounding box, preserving the colors (including any background white/0 pixels within the box). Call this the `raw_pattern`.
    4.  Initialize a 3x3 grid with all white (0) pixels. Call this the `base_pattern`.
    5.  Copy the `raw_pattern` into the `base_pattern` such that the bottom-left corner of the `raw_pattern` aligns with the bottom-left corner (row 2, col 0) of the `base_pattern`. If the `raw_pattern` is smaller than 3x3, the remaining cells in `base_pattern` stay white (0). If the `raw_pattern` were larger than 3x3 (not seen in examples), assume only the bottom-left 3x3 portion is copied.
    6.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Let this count be `N`.
    7.  Create the output grid by horizontally concatenating the `base_pattern` `N` times. The final output grid will have 3 rows and `3 * N` columns.
