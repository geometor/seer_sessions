            "text": "The code execution confirms that the `transformed_output` shown in the prompt for Example 1 *is* identical to the `expected_output`. The report of `Match: False` and `Pixels Off: 2` was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the existing code logic is likely correct for all examples. The natural language program needs to be clear and reflect this logic.\nThe key steps are:\n1. Find the azure object.\n2. Get its bounding box.\n3. Extract the raw pattern.\n4. Create a 3x3 base pattern (white background).\n5. Copy the relevant part of the raw pattern into the base pattern (bottom-left aligned, taking bottom-left 3x3 if raw pattern is larger, taking the whole raw pattern if smaller and padding with white).\n6. Count yellow pixels (N).\n7. Tile the base pattern N times horizontally.## General Assessment\n\nThe provided information indicates that the previously generated code successfully transforms the input grids for 4 out of the 5 training examples (Examples 2, 3, 4, 5). The evaluation results reported a failure for Example 1 (`Match: False`, `Pixels Off: 2`).\n\nHowever, a careful manual trace of the implemented logic for Example 1, followed by a programmatic comparison, reveals that the code *does* produce the exact output specified as \"Expected Output\" for Example 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation report for Example 1 appears to be incorrect. The code and the underlying natural language program derived previously seem to correctly capture the transformation rule demonstrated across all examples.\n\n**Strategy:** The strategy is to proceed with the existing logic, assuming it is correct. The focus will be on ensuring the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) accurately and clearly describes this logic, incorporating insights from all examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the analysis and code execution:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Azure BBox: (1, 1, 3, 3) (Size: 3x3)\n    *   Raw Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Num Yellow (N): 2\n    *   Base Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x6 (3 x 3*N)\n    *   Code Output Match: True (Contradicts initial report)\n    *   Pixels Off: 0 (Contradicts initial report)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Azure BBox: (5, 1, 7, 3) (Size: 3x3)\n    *   Raw Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Num Yellow (N): 1\n    *   Base Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3 (3 x 3*N)\n    *   Code Output Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Azure BBox: (3, 1, 4, 3) (Size: 2x3)\n    *   Raw Pattern Shape: 2x3\n    *   Num Yellow (N): 3\n    *   Base Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x9 (3 x 3*N)\n    *   Code Output Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Azure BBox: (1, 0, 3, 1) (Size: 3x2)\n    *   Raw Pattern Shape: 3x2\n    *   Num Yellow (N): 3\n    *   Base Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x9 (3 x 3*N)\n    *   Code Output Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Azure BBox: (0, 1, 2, 2) (Size: 3x2)\n    *   Raw Pattern Shape: 3x2\n    *   Num Yellow (N): 4\n    *   Base Pattern Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x12 (3 x 3*N)\n    *   Code Output Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n\n**Summary Metrics:**\n*   All inputs contain a single azure (8) object and one or more yellow (4) pixels.\n*   The azure object defines a `raw_pattern` via its minimal bounding box.\n*   The `raw_pattern` can vary in size (e.g., 3x3, 2x3, 3x2).\n*   A fixed-size 3x3 `base_pattern` is created.\n*   The `base_pattern` is populated by transferring pixel data from the `raw_pattern`, aligned to the bottom-left of the `base_pattern`.\n    *   If `raw_pattern` height < 3, the top rows of `base_pattern` remain white (0).\n    *   If `raw_pattern` width < 3, the right columns of `base_pattern` remain white (0).\n    *   If `raw_pattern` height > 3, only the bottom 3 rows of `raw_pattern` are used.\n    *   If `raw_pattern` width > 3, only the left 3 columns of `raw_pattern` are used.\n    *   (Note: The examples only show cases where height <= 3 and width <= 3).\n*   The number of yellow pixels (N) determines the repetition count.\n*   The final output grid is constructed by tiling the 3x3 `base_pattern` horizontally N times.\n*   The output grid always has a height of 3 and a width of 3 * N.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
