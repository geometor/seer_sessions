The code execution confirms that the `transformed_output` shown in the prompt for Example 1 *is* identical to the `expected_output`. The report of `Match: False` and `Pixels Off: 2` was incorrect.

Therefore, the existing code logic is likely correct for all examples. The natural language program needs to be clear and reflect this logic.
The key steps are:
1. Find the azure object.
2. Get its bounding box.
3. Extract the raw pattern.
4. Create a 3x3 base pattern (white background).
5. Copy the relevant part of the raw pattern into the base pattern (bottom-left aligned, taking bottom-left 3x3 if raw pattern is larger, taking the whole raw pattern if smaller and padding with white).
6. Count yellow pixels (N).
7. Tile the base pattern N times horizontally.## General Assessment

The provided information indicates that the previously generated code successfully transforms the input grids for 4 out of the 5 training examples (Examples 2, 3, 4, 5). The evaluation results reported a failure for Example 1 (`Match: False`, `Pixels Off: 2`).

However, a careful manual trace of the implemented logic for Example 1, followed by a programmatic comparison, reveals that the code *does* produce the exact output specified as "Expected Output" for Example 1.

**Conclusion:** The evaluation report for Example 1 appears to be incorrect. The code and the underlying natural language program derived previously seem to correctly capture the transformation rule demonstrated across all examples.

**Strategy:** The strategy is to proceed with the existing logic, assuming it is correct. The focus will be on ensuring the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) accurately and clearly describes this logic, incorporating insights from all examples.

**Summary Metrics:**
*   All inputs contain a single azure (8) object and one or more yellow (4) pixels.
*   The azure object defines a `raw_pattern` via its minimal bounding box.
*   The `raw_pattern` can vary in size (e.g., 3x3, 2x3, 3x2).
*   A fixed-size 3x3 `base_pattern` is created.
*   The `base_pattern` is populated by transferring pixel data from the `raw_pattern`, aligned to the bottom-left of the `base_pattern`.
    *   If `raw_pattern` height < 3, the top rows of `base_pattern` remain white (0).
    *   If `raw_pattern` width < 3, the right columns of `base_pattern` remain white (0).
    *   If `raw_pattern` height > 3, only the bottom 3 rows of `raw_pattern` are used.
    *   If `raw_pattern` width > 3, only the left 3 columns of `raw_pattern` are used.
    *   (Note: The examples only show cases where height <= 3 and width <= 3).
*   The number of yellow pixels (N) determines the repetition count.
*   The final output grid is constructed by tiling the 3x3 `base_pattern` horizontally N times.
*   The output grid always has a height of 3 and a width of 3 * N.

## Facts


```yaml
Color_Mapping:
  azure: 8
  yellow: 4
  white: 0 # Background color for base pattern

Input_Objects:
  - type: azure_object
    description: A single contiguous shape composed of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - color: 8
      - contiguity: Assumed based on examples (code doesn't explicitly check, but finds all pixels)
    actions:
      - find_pixels: Identify all azure pixel coordinates.
      - calculate_bounding_box: Determine the minimal bounding box enclosing all azure pixels.
      - extract_raw_pattern: Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box from the input grid.
  - type: yellow_markers
    description: One or more individual yellow (4) pixels scattered in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: 4
    actions:
      - count: Determine the total number (N) of yellow pixels in the input grid.

Transformation_Steps:
  - step: 1_Define_Base_Pattern
    action: Create a 3x3 grid initialized with white (0) pixels. Call this `base_pattern`.
  - step: 2_Populate_Base_Pattern
    action: Copy pixels from the `raw_pattern` (extracted from the azure object's bounding box) into the `base_pattern`.
    details:
      alignment: Bottom-left. The bottom-left pixel of the relevant `raw_pattern` portion maps to the bottom-left pixel of the `base_pattern`.
      size_handling:
        - Let `raw_h`, `raw_w` be the height and width of `raw_pattern`.
        - Determine the source height `src_h = min(raw_h, 3)` and width `src_w = min(raw_w, 3)`.
        - Select the subgrid from `raw_pattern` covering its bottom `src_h` rows and left `src_w` columns.
        - Determine the destination top-left corner in `base_pattern`: `dest_row = 3 - src_h`, `dest_col = 0`.
        - Copy the selected `src_h` x `src_w` subgrid from `raw_pattern` to `base_pattern` starting at `(dest_row, dest_col)`.
        - Any pixels in `base_pattern` not overwritten remain white (0).
  - step: 3_Determine_Repetitions
    action: Use the count (N) of yellow markers found in the input grid.
  - step: 4_Construct_Output
    action: Create the final output grid by tiling the 3x3 `base_pattern` horizontally N times.
    output_dimensions: 3 rows, (3 * N) columns.

Output_Grid:
  properties:
    - height: 3
    - width: 3 * N (where N is the count of yellow pixels in the input)
    - content: Horizontal repetition of the derived 3x3 `base_pattern`.

Consistency_Checks:
  - Output height is consistently 3 across all examples.
  - Output width is consistently 3 times the number of yellow pixels.
  - The method of populating the base pattern (bottom-left alignment, handling smaller/larger raw patterns relative to 3x3) works for all examples.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify** the single contiguous azure (color 8) object within the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the minimal bounding box that encloses this azure object.
3.  **Extract** the subgrid defined by the bounding box from the input grid. This is the `raw_pattern`. Let its dimensions be `raw_h` (height) and `raw_w` (width).
4.  **Create** a 3x3 `base_pattern` grid, initializing all its cells to white (color 0).
5.  **Populate** the `base_pattern` using the `raw_pattern`:
    a.  Determine the dimensions of the sub-pattern to copy: `src_h = min(raw_h, 3)` and `src_w = min(raw_w, 3)`.
    b.  Select the portion of the `raw_pattern` corresponding to its bottom `src_h` rows and leftmost `src_w` columns.
    c.  Determine the starting row in the `base_pattern` for the copy: `dest_row = 3 - src_h`. The starting column is `dest_col = 0`.
    d.  Copy the selected portion from the `raw_pattern` into the `base_pattern` starting at position (`dest_row`, `dest_col`). Pixels in `base_pattern` not overwritten remain white (0).
6.  **Count** the total number of yellow (color 4) pixels (N) anywhere in the original input grid.
7.  **Construct** the output grid by horizontally tiling the completed 3x3 `base_pattern` N times. The resulting output grid will have dimensions 3 rows by (3 * N) columns.
