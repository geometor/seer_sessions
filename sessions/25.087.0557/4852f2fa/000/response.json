The output grid consists of repetitions of a 3x3 pattern derived from the input azure object. The number of repetitions is determined by the count of yellow pixels in the input. The background is white (0). The core transformation seems to be extracting a shape, counting markers, and tiling the shape based on the count.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Copy the `raw_pattern` into the `base_pattern` such that the bottom-left corner of the `raw_pattern` aligns with the bottom-left corner (row 2, col 0) of the `base_pattern`. If the `raw_pattern` is smaller than 3x3, the remaining cells in `base_pattern` stay white (0). If the `raw_pattern` were larger than 3x3 (not seen in examples), assume only the bottom-left 3x3 portion is copied.\n    6.  Count the total number of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
