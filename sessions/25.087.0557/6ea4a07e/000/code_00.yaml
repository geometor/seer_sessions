task_context:
  grid_size: fixed (3x3 for all examples)
  input_composition: contains white (0) and one unique non-white color
  output_composition: contains white (0) and one unique non-white color

transformations:
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color: 8 (azure)
    output_color: 2 (red)
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color: 3 (green)
    output_color: 1 (blue)
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color: 5 (gray)
    output_color: 4 (yellow)
  - type: pattern_inversion
    description: >
      The spatial pattern of the non-white color is inverted.
      Cells that were white in the input become the output color.
      Cells that held the unique input color become white in the output.

objects:
  - object: input_pattern
    description: The set of cells containing the unique non-white color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: varies (8, 3, or 5 in examples)
  - object: output_pattern
    description: The set of cells containing the unique non-white color in the output grid.
    properties:
      - color: determined by mapping from input_pattern color (2, 1, or 4 in examples)
  - object: background
    description: The set of cells containing white (0).
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)

relationships:
  - relation: inverse_position
    object1: input_pattern
    object2: output_pattern
    description: The positions occupied by the output_pattern are precisely those *not* occupied by the input_pattern within the grid boundaries.
  - relation: color_correspondence
    object1: input_pattern
    object2: output_pattern
    description: The color of the output_pattern is determined by a fixed mapping based on the color of the input_pattern.
