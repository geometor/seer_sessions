task_description: Simulate gravity towards a static red barrier.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      background_color: white (0)
      contains: colored objects
  - type: object
    identifier: static_barrier
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: variable (line in examples)
      behavior: remains stationary
      role: acts as a stopping point for moving objects
  - type: object
    identifier: moving_objects
    properties:
      color: any non-white (0), non-red (2) color
      shape: variable, contiguous blocks of same color
      behavior: move towards the static_barrier
      role: subject to the gravity-like transformation
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Moving objects stop when adjacent (orthogonally) to the static_barrier or another previously stopped moving_object in the direction of movement.
actions:
  - name: identify_barrier
    inputs: input_grid
    output: location and extent of the red (2) object(s)
  - name: determine_direction
    inputs: static_barrier position, grid dimensions
    output: direction of movement (down, left, or right)
  - name: identify_movers
    inputs: input_grid
    output: list of all non-white, non-red objects (pixels and their locations)
  - name: simulate_movement
    inputs: input_grid, static_barrier, moving_objects, direction
    output: output_grid
    details: |
      Iteratively move each moving_object one step in the determined direction.
      In each step, check for collisions:
      1. Grid boundaries
      2. Static barrier
      3. Other moving objects (in their current positions for the iteration)
      An object stops if it cannot move one step without a collision.
      Repeat iterations until no object moves in a full iteration.
