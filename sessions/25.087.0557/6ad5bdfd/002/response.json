            "text": "The metrics confirm the object definitions and the fact that the previous code incorrectly split objects during transformation (e.g., `Ex1 Transformed Output Objects` shows `color_8_obj_1` and `color_8_obj_2` where there should only be one `8` object). The determined directions are correct for the examples. The `get_object_pixels` helper function works as expected.\n\nThis confirms the core issue is the pixel-based movement instead of object-based movement.\n\n**Final Refinement:**\n\nThe simulation needs to handle object integrity. When checking if an object can move, we must verify that *all* target cells for *all* pixels of that object are valid (within bounds, not red, and currently white/empty). The simulation loop should repeatedly find all objects that *can* move one step and then update the grid state by moving them.\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Barrier and Objects:** Locate the red pixels (color 2), which form the static barrier. Identify all distinct contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than white (0) and red (2). These are the movable objects.\n2.  **Determine Gravity Direction:** Calculate the overall direction of \"gravity\".\n    *   Find the average row and column of all red pixels.\n    *   Find the average row and column of all pixels belonging to movable objects.\n    *   If the average red row is significantly greater than the average object row, the direction is Down (1, 0).\n    *   Else if the average red column is significantly less than the average object column, the direction is Left (0, -1).\n    *   Else if the average red column is significantly greater than the average object column, the direction is Right (0, 1).\n    *   Use tie-breaking rules (e.g., proximity to boundaries, relative shapes) if averages are ambiguous. If no direction is clear, no movement occurs.\n3.  **Simulate Movement Iteratively:**\n    *   Start with the input grid state.\n    *   Repeat the following steps until an iteration occurs where no object moves:\n        *   Mark all movable objects as potentially mobile for this iteration.\n        *   Create a temporary grid representing the state after this iteration's moves. Initialize it with the barrier (red) and background (white) pixels from the current grid state. Copy non-moving objects (those already settled against a barrier in previous steps or blocked in this step) to the temp grid.\n        *   Create a list of objects that successfully moved in this iteration.\n        *   Iterate through the potentially mobile objects (consider processing order based on gravity direction - e.g., for Down gravity, process objects starting from lower rows first, or further objects first).\n        *   For each potentially mobile object:\n            *   Check if *all* pixels comprising the object can move one step in the determined gravity direction. A target position is valid if it is within the grid boundaries, is not red, and is currently occupied by a white pixel in the *current* grid state (or potentially, unoccupied by any object that hasn't moved yet in this iteration - careful state management needed).\n            *   If the object *can* move: Update its position by the gravity vector. Add it to the list of moved objects for this iteration. Mark its new position in the temporary grid.\n            *   If the object *cannot* move: Mark it as settled in its current position. Copy it to the temporary grid in its current location.\n        *   After checking all potentially mobile objects, update the main grid state to match the temporary grid.\n        *   If the list of moved objects for this iteration is empty, break the loop.\n4.  **Output Final Grid:** Return the grid state after the simulation loop terminates.Okay, let's analyze the results and refine our understanding.\n\n**General Assessment & Strategy**\n\nThe provided code attempts to simulate a gravity effect where objects fall towards a red barrier. The results show that the code correctly determines the direction of gravity (Down, Left, Right) for the given examples. However, it fails to produce the correct final state in all three training examples.\n\nThe core issue appears to be the handling of object movement. The code moves individual pixels rather than contiguous objects as single units. This leads to objects \"breaking apart\" or pixels moving independently past where the object should have stopped as a whole. For example, in Example 1, the two adjacent '8' pixels at the top start as one object but end up in different locations relative to each other in the transformed output, contrary to the expected output where they remain adjacent. The same splitting behavior is observed for the '8' object in Example 2 and the '9' object in Example 3.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the transformation logic to explicitly identify contiguous objects and simulate their movement as atomic units. An object should only move if *all* its constituent pixels can move into valid empty spaces. It stops when *any* part of it encounters a boundary, the red barrier, or another settled object.\n\n**Metrics & Analysis**\n\nUsing the `tool_code` execution:\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function confirms that the input grids contain multi-pixel contiguous objects (e.g., `color_8_obj_1` in Ex1 is `[(0, 4), (0, 5)]`).\n2.  **Object Splitting:** Comparing `Ex1 Expected Output Objects` with `Ex1 Transformed Output Objects` clearly shows the '8' object `[(0, 4), (0, 5)]` should end up as `[(6, 4), (6, 5)]`, but the code produced two separate '8' objects: `[(6, 5)]` and `[(8, 4)]`. Similar splitting occurred in Ex2 and Ex3.\n3.  **Gravity Direction:** The simplified direction check confirms the directions determined by the original code logic were correct for these examples: Down (1, 0) for Ex1, Left (0, -1) for Ex2, and Right (0, 1) for Ex3.\n4.  **Movement Unit:** The discrepancies consistently point towards the need to treat contiguous blocks of the same color (excluding red and white) as single, non-splittable objects during movement.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
