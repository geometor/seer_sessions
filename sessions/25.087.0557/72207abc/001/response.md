def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the following rule:
    1. Identify the active row, which is the second row (row index 1). The first and third rows remain unchanged (all white pixels).
    2. Scan the active row from left to right and identify the sequence `S` of unique non-white colors encountered.
    3. Find the index `last_idx` of the rightmost non-white pixel in the input active row.
    4. Find the locations of the last two distinct colors in the input active row. Calculate the number of white pixels between them (`gap_count`). If there are fewer than two distinct colors or they are adjacent, `gap_count` is 0.
    5. Initialize the gap size `N` for the first insertion as `gap_count + 1`.
    6. Initialize the starting position for insertions `current_pos = last_idx`.
    7. Initialize an index `color_idx = 0` to track the current color to be placed from sequence `S`.
    8. Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    9. While the calculated next placement position is within the bounds of the grid's width:
        a. Calculate the target column index for the next placement: `target_col = current_pos + N + 1`.
        b. If `target_col` is less than the grid width:
            i. Get the color `C = S[color_idx]`.
            ii. Place color `C` at `(1, target_col)` in the output grid.
            iii. Update `current_pos` to `target_col`.
            iv. Increment the gap size `N` by 1.
            v. Update the color index: `color_idx = (color_idx + 1) % length(S)`.
        c. Else (if `target_col` is outside the grid width): Stop the process.
    10. Return the modified grid as the output.
