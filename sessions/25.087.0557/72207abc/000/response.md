*   **Perception**:
    *   All input and output grids have a height of 3. The width varies between examples.
    *   The first row (index 0) and the third row (index 2) consist entirely of `white` pixels (0) in both input and output.
    *   All transformations occur within the second row (index 1).
    *   The input's second row starts with a small number of non-`white` pixels, followed by `white` pixels.
    *   The output's second row preserves the initial non-`white` pixels and their positions from the input.
    *   Additional non-`white` pixels are added to the right end of the second row in the output.
    *   These added pixels seem to follow a repeating pattern based on the colors present in the input's second row.
    *   The spacing (number of `white` pixels) between the added colored pixels increases progressively.

```yaml
    grid_properties:
      height: 3
      width: variable
    row_properties:
      - row_index: 0
        content: all white pixels
      - row_index: 1
        content: contains signal pixels, transformation occurs here
      - row_index: 2
        content: all white pixels
    input_features:
      active_row: row 1
      signal_pixels: Non-white pixels located at the beginning of the active row.
      signal_colors: The sequence of distinct non-white colors encountered when scanning the active row from left to right. Let this sequence be S.
      last_signal_index: The column index of the rightmost non-white pixel in the input active row.
      initial_gap: The number of white pixels between the last two distinct non-white colors in the input active row (0 if fewer than two distinct colors or if they are adjacent).
    transformation:
      action: repetition_with_increasing_gap
      target: active_row (row 1)
      process:
        - Step 1: Copy the input active row to the output active row.
        - Step 2: Determine the sequence of distinct non-white colors (S) from the input active row.
        - Step 3: Determine the initial gap size (N) for insertion, calculated as (number of white pixels between the last two distinct colors in the input) + 1. If there are less than two distinct colors or they are adjacent, N starts at 1.
        - Step 4: Initialize the current insertion index to the index immediately following the last non-white pixel in the input active row.
        - Step 5: Initialize a color index `c_idx` to 0, pointing to the first color in sequence S.
        - Step 6: Loop while the next placement position is within the grid bounds:
            - Calculate the next placement index: `placement_idx = current_insertion_index + N`.
            - If `placement_idx` is within the grid width:
                - Place the color `S[c_idx]` at `placement_idx` in the output active row.
                - Update `current_insertion_index` to `placement_idx`.
                - Increment the gap size `N` by 1.
                - Update the color index `c_idx = (c_idx + 1) % length(S)`.
            - Else (placement outside bounds): Stop the loop.
    output_features:
      active_row: Contains the original signal pixels plus the newly added pixels according to the repetition rule.
      other_rows: Identical to input (all white).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the active row, which is the second row (row index 1) of the input grid. The first and third rows remain unchanged (all `white` pixels).
    2.  Scan the active row from left to right and identify the sequence `S` of unique non-`white` colors encountered.
    3.  Find the index `last_idx` of the rightmost non-`white` pixel in the input active row.
    4.  Find the locations of the last two distinct colors in the input active row. Calculate the number of `white` pixels between them (`gap_count`). If there are fewer than two distinct colors or they are adjacent, `gap_count` is 0.
    5.  Initialize the gap size `N` for the first insertion as `gap_count + 1`.
    6.  Initialize the starting position for insertions `current_pos = last_idx`.
    7.  Initialize an index `color_idx = 0` to track the current color to be placed from sequence `S`.
    8.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
    9.  While the calculated next placement position is within the bounds of the grid's width:
        a.  Calculate the target column index for the next placement: `target_col = current_pos + N + 1`. Note: This calculation reflects inserting `N` white pixels after `current_pos`, so the new color goes at `current_pos + N + 1`.
        b.  If `target_col` is less than the grid width:
            i.  Get the color `C = S[color_idx]`.
            ii. Place color `C` at `(1, target_col)` in the output grid.
            iii. Update `current_pos` to `target_col`.
            iv. Increment the gap size `N` by 1.
            v.  Update the color index: `color_idx = (color_idx + 1) % length(S)`.
        c.  Else (if `target_col` is outside the grid width): Stop the process.
    10. Return the modified grid as the output.
