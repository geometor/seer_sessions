The width varies between examples.\n    *   The first row (index 0) and the third row (index 2) consist entirely of `white` pixels (0) in both input and output.\n    *   All transformations occur within the second row (index 1).\n    *   The input's second row starts with a small number of non-`white` pixels, followed by `white` pixels.\n    *   The output's second row preserves the initial non-`white` pixels and their positions from the input.\n    *   Additional non-`white` pixels are added to the right end of the second row in the output.\n    *   These added pixels seem to follow a repeating pattern based on the colors present in the input's second row.\n    *   The spacing (number of `white` pixels) between the added colored pixels increases progressively.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
