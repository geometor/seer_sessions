*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grids are consistently 12 rows by 4 columns.
    *   The output grids are consistently 6 rows by 4 columns.
    *   The input grids contain white (0), green (3), and gray (5) pixels.
    *   The output grids contain white (0) and yellow (4) pixels.
    *   The input grids appear vertically divided: the top 6 rows feature green and white, while the bottom 6 rows feature gray and white.
    *   The output grid dimensions (6x4) match the dimensions of these top and bottom sections of the input grid.
    *   Comparing the patterns, the output grid seems to be a combination or overlay of the top 6x4 section and the bottom 6x4 section of the input grid.
    *   Specifically, a pixel in the output grid is yellow (4) if the corresponding pixel in *either* the top half *or* the bottom half of the input grid is non-white (green or gray). If both corresponding pixels in the input halves are white (0), the output pixel is white (0).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Divide the 12x4 input grid into two 6x4 grids: the top half (rows 0-5) and the bottom half (rows 6-11).
    2.  Create a new 6x4 output grid, initializing all its pixels to white (0).
    3.  For each row index `r` from 0 to 5 and each column index `c` from 0 to 3:
        a.  Examine the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the top half grid.
        b.  Examine the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the bottom half grid.
        c.  If the pixel in the top half is *not* white (0) OR the pixel in the bottom half is *not* white (0), set the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to yellow (4).
        d.  (Implicitly) Otherwise, the pixel at position (`r`, `c`) in the output grid remains white (0).
    4.  Return the completed 6x4 output grid.
