            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are grids of varying sizes (7x7 or 9x9). They contain a background color (white, 0), a large connected shape of one color (blue, 1 in all examples), and scattered pixels of a third color (yellow, 4; magenta, 6; green, 3).\n2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are always 3x3 grids. They contain the background color (white, 0) and the scattered pixel color from the input.\n3.  **Color Roles:**\n    *   White (0) acts as the background.\n    *   Blue (1) forms a large, connected shape which seems to act as a container or boundary.\n    *   The third color (yellow, magenta, green) appears as individual pixels, some inside the blue shape, some outside. This seems to be the 'target' color.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid's content seems related to the *count* of the target-colored pixels that are located *inside* the region enclosed by the blue shape.\n5.  **Output Encoding:** The count `N` of the enclosed target pixels determines how many cells in the 3x3 output grid are filled with the target color. The filling proceeds row by row, from left to right. The remaining cells are filled with the background color (white).\n\n    *   Example 1: 3 yellow pixels inside the blue 'L'. Output has 3 yellow pixels in the top row.\n    *   Example 2: 5 magenta pixels inside the blue 'C'. Output has 5 magenta pixels (top row filled, first two of the second row).\n    *   Example 3: 4 green pixels inside the blue shape. Output has 4 green pixels (top row filled, first one of the second row).\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
