task_description: Identify a large container shape and count the number of specific target pixels enclosed within it, then represent this count in a 3x3 grid using the target pixel color.

definitions:
  - name: container_shape
    description: The largest connected component of non-background pixels. In the examples, this is always color blue (1).
  - name: target_pixels
    description: Pixels of a color different from both the background (white, 0) and the container_shape color.
  - name: inside_region
    description: The area enclosed by the container_shape. A pixel is considered inside if it is not part of the container_shape itself and any path from it to the grid boundary must cross the container_shape.
  - name: output_grid
    description: A fixed-size 3x3 grid.

transformation_steps:
  - action: identify_container
    input: input_grid
    output: container_shape, container_color (C1)
    details: Find the largest connected component of a single non-white color.
  - action: identify_target_color
    input: input_grid, container_color (C1)
    output: target_color (C2)
    details: Find the non-white color present in the grid that is not C1.
  - action: determine_inside_pixels
    input: input_grid, container_shape
    output: set_of_inside_coordinates
    details: Identify all grid coordinates corresponding to the inside_region. This can be done using a flood-fill approach starting from the grid boundaries, marking all reachable non-container cells as 'outside'. The remaining non-container cells are 'inside'.
  - action: count_enclosed_targets
    input: input_grid, target_color (C2), set_of_inside_coordinates
    output: count (N)
    details: Iterate through the set_of_inside_coordinates and count how many correspond to pixels with the target_color (C2).
  - action: construct_output_grid
    input: count (N), target_color (C2)
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a 3x3 grid initialized with white (0). Fill the first N cells (in row-major order) with target_color (C2).

input_output_mapping:
  example_1:
    container_color: 1 (blue)
    target_color: 4 (yellow)
    inside_region_pixels: [(4,4), (5,1), (5,3)] # Assuming these are inside
    count: 3
    output_grid_pattern: Fill first 3 cells with yellow (4).
  example_2:
    container_color: 1 (blue)
    target_color: 6 (magenta)
    inside_region_pixels: [(2,4), (2,6), (3,5), (4,7), (5,4)] # Assuming these are inside
    count: 5
    output_grid_pattern: Fill first 5 cells with magenta (6).
  example_3:
    container_color: 1 (blue)
    target_color: 3 (green)
    inside_region_pixels: [(2,5), (4,5), (5,3), (7,4)] # Assuming these are inside
    count: 4
    output_grid_pattern: Fill first 4 cells with green (3).
