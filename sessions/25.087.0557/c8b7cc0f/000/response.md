Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs are grids of varying sizes (7x7 or 9x9). They contain a background color (white, 0), a large connected shape of one color (blue, 1 in all examples), and scattered pixels of a third color (yellow, 4; magenta, 6; green, 3).
2.  **Output Structure:** The outputs are always 3x3 grids. They contain the background color (white, 0) and the scattered pixel color from the input.
3.  **Color Roles:**
    *   White (0) acts as the background.
    *   Blue (1) forms a large, connected shape which seems to act as a container or boundary.
    *   The third color (yellow, magenta, green) appears as individual pixels, some inside the blue shape, some outside. This seems to be the 'target' color.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output grid's content seems related to the *count* of the target-colored pixels that are located *inside* the region enclosed by the blue shape.
5.  **Output Encoding:** The count `N` of the enclosed target pixels determines how many cells in the 3x3 output grid are filled with the target color. The filling proceeds row by row, from left to right. The remaining cells are filled with the background color (white).

    *   Example 1: 3 yellow pixels inside the blue 'L'. Output has 3 yellow pixels in the top row.
    *   Example 2: 5 magenta pixels inside the blue 'C'. Output has 5 magenta pixels (top row filled, first two of the second row).
    *   Example 3: 4 green pixels inside the blue shape. Output has 4 green pixels (top row filled, first one of the second row).

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: Identify a large container shape and count the number of specific target pixels enclosed within it, then represent this count in a 3x3 grid using the target pixel color.

definitions:
  - name: container_shape
    description: The largest connected component of non-background pixels. In the examples, this is always color blue (1).
  - name: target_pixels
    description: Pixels of a color different from both the background (white, 0) and the container_shape color.
  - name: inside_region
    description: The area enclosed by the container_shape. A pixel is considered inside if it is not part of the container_shape itself and any path from it to the grid boundary must cross the container_shape.
  - name: output_grid
    description: A fixed-size 3x3 grid.

transformation_steps:
  - action: identify_container
    input: input_grid
    output: container_shape, container_color (C1)
    details: Find the largest connected component of a single non-white color.
  - action: identify_target_color
    input: input_grid, container_color (C1)
    output: target_color (C2)
    details: Find the non-white color present in the grid that is not C1.
  - action: determine_inside_pixels
    input: input_grid, container_shape
    output: set_of_inside_coordinates
    details: Identify all grid coordinates corresponding to the inside_region. This can be done using a flood-fill approach starting from the grid boundaries, marking all reachable non-container cells as 'outside'. The remaining non-container cells are 'inside'.
  - action: count_enclosed_targets
    input: input_grid, target_color (C2), set_of_inside_coordinates
    output: count (N)
    details: Iterate through the set_of_inside_coordinates and count how many correspond to pixels with the target_color (C2).
  - action: construct_output_grid
    input: count (N), target_color (C2)
    output: output_grid
    details: Create a 3x3 grid initialized with white (0). Fill the first N cells (in row-major order) with target_color (C2).

input_output_mapping:
  example_1:
    container_color: 1 (blue)
    target_color: 4 (yellow)
    inside_region_pixels: [(4,4), (5,1), (5,3)] # Assuming these are inside
    count: 3
    output_grid_pattern: Fill first 3 cells with yellow (4).
  example_2:
    container_color: 1 (blue)
    target_color: 6 (magenta)
    inside_region_pixels: [(2,4), (2,6), (3,5), (4,7), (5,4)] # Assuming these are inside
    count: 5
    output_grid_pattern: Fill first 5 cells with magenta (6).
  example_3:
    container_color: 1 (blue)
    target_color: 3 (green)
    inside_region_pixels: [(2,5), (4,5), (5,3), (7,4)] # Assuming these are inside
    count: 4
    output_grid_pattern: Fill first 4 cells with green (3).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single color (C1) that forms the largest connected block of non-white pixels in the input grid. This is the 'container' color.
2.  Identify the other non-white color (C2) present in the input grid. This is the 'target' color.
3.  Determine the region strictly enclosed by the container shape formed by color C1. This can be achieved by performing a flood fill starting from all border cells that are not of color C1; any cell not belonging to the container shape (C1) and not reached by this flood fill is considered 'inside'.
4.  Count how many pixels of the target color (C2) are located within this 'inside' region. Let this count be N.
5.  Create a new 3x3 grid, initially filled with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Fill the first N cells of this 3x3 grid with the target color (C2), proceeding row by row from top to bottom, and left to right within each row.
7.  The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.
