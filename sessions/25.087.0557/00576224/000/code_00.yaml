Task: Tile a 2x2 input grid into a 6x6 output grid with modifications based on tile row position.

Input_Grid:
  - type: object
  - properties:
      - shape: [2, 2]
      - content: four pixels of potentially different colors

Output_Grid:
  - type: object
  - properties:
      - shape: [6, 6] (3x input height, 3x input width)
      - content: derived from input grid tiling

Transformations:
  - name: Tiling
    input: Input_Grid
    output: Output_Grid
    details: Output is composed of a 3x3 arrangement of 2x2 blocks derived from the Input_Grid.
  - name: Column_Swap
    input: Input_Grid
    output: Modified_Input_Grid
    details: Creates a new 2x2 grid by swapping the left and right columns of the Input_Grid.

Relationships:
  - The Output_Grid is constructed block by block based on a 3x3 conceptual grid of tiles.
  - Tile_Position: Determines which version of the input grid is used for a specific 2x2 block in the Output_Grid.
    - condition: If the conceptual row index of the tile is even (0 or 2).
      - action: Use the original Input_Grid as the tile.
    - condition: If the conceptual row index of the tile is odd (1).
      - action: Use the Modified_Input_Grid (columns swapped) as the tile.
