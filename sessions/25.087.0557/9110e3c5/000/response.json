I need to implement the object finding logic myself or use a different approach.\n\nLet's manually re-verify the largest object counts and colors, being careful about connectivity (using 4-way, adjacent sides).\n\n**`train_1`:**\n*   Yellow (4): obj1 (1,0)=1px, obj2 (6,4)=1px.

Connects to (5,6).\n    *   It looks like *all* green pixels belong to a single object. Let's count them: 2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+3+1 = 21 pixels.\n*   Orange (7): (1,6). Size=1.\n*   Red (2): (6,5). Size=1.\n*   **Largest is Green (3) with 21 pixels.** Output Pattern C. Matches.\n\n**Conclusion:** The hypothesis seems correct. Find the largest object (using 8-way connectivity), determine its color, and output a fixed 3x3 pattern based on that color (Blue=A, Red=B, Green=C). Assume ties are broken by lower color index (though no ties were observed yet between Blue, Red, Green).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the three output patterns A, B, C.\n2.  Implement object detection (connected components) using 8-way connectivity.\n3.  Iterate through colors present in the input grid (excluding white/0).\n4.  For each color, find all objects and their sizes.\n5.  Keep track of the largest object found so far (size and color). Apply tie-breaking (lower color index wins) if sizes are equal.\n6.  After checking all colors, determine the color of the overall largest object.\n7.  Return the 3x3 pattern corresponding to that color.**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes a 7x7 input grid with various colors (0-9) and produces a 3x3 output grid consisting only of white (0) and azure (8).\n2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple contiguous areas (objects) of different colors. Connectivity appears to be 8-way (including diagonals).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies a specific property related to the objects in the input grid and maps this property to one of three predefined 3x3 azure patterns.\n4.  **Key Feature:** The determining property seems to be the color of the *largest* contiguous object (measured by pixel count) within the input grid.\n5.  **Color-Pattern Mapping:** There's a consistent mapping between the color of the largest object and the output pattern:\n    *   If the largest object is Blue (1), the output is Pattern A: `[[0,0,8],[8,8,0],[0,8,0]]`.\n    *   If the largest object is Red (2), the output is Pattern B: `[[0,0,0],[8,8,8],[0,0,0]]`.\n    *   If the largest object is Green (3), the output is Pattern C: `[[0,8,8],[0,8,0],[0,8,0]]`.\n6.  **Tie-breaking:** Although not explicitly demonstrated with ties between Blue, Red, and Green objects, a reasonable tie-breaking rule (e.g., choosing the color with the lower index) should be considered if objects of different relevant colors have the same maximum size. Based on analysis, 8-way connectivity is used.\n\n**Facts (YAML Block):**\n\n"
