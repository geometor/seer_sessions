task_type: identification_and_mapping
input_grid_size: 7x7
output_grid_size: 3x3
output_colors: [white, azure]
input_features:
  - property: objects
    description: Contiguous areas of non-white pixels.
    attributes:
      - color: The color index (1-9) of the object's pixels.
      - size: The number of pixels in the object.
      - connectivity: Assumed to be 8-way (pixels are connected if they touch at sides or corners).
dominant_feature:
  - property: largest_object
    description: The object with the maximum number of pixels.
    tie_breaking: If multiple objects share the maximum size, the one with the lowest color index is chosen.
    relevant_colors: [blue, red, green] # Colors observed to determine output patterns.
transformation: mapping
mapping_rules:
  - condition: Largest object color is blue (1)
    output: Predefined Pattern A [[0,0,8],[8,8,0],[0,8,0]]
  - condition: Largest object color is red (2)
    output: Predefined Pattern B [[0,0,0],[8,8,8],[0,0,0]]
  - condition: Largest object color is green (3)
    output: Predefined Pattern C [[0,8,8],[0,8,0],[0,8,0]]
  - condition: Largest object color is other (not 1, 2, or 3)
    output: Undefined by examples, but assumed not to occur based on training data.
output_representation: A fixed 3x3 grid pattern representing the color category of the largest input object.
