Okay, `skimage` is not available. I need to implement the object finding logic myself or use a different approach.

Let's manually re-verify the largest object counts and colors, being careful about connectivity (using 4-way, adjacent sides).

**`train_1`:**
*   Yellow (4): obj1 (1,0)=1px, obj2 (6,4)=1px. Max=1
*   Blue (1): obj1 at (0,2)=1px, obj2 at (0,5)=1px, obj3 starting at (2,0) connects (2,1), (3,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (5,4), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,5). Size = 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 11. Max=11
*   Magenta (6): obj1 at (0,6)=1px. Max=1
*   Red (2): obj1 at (4,5)=1px. Max=1
*   Orange (7): obj1 at (5,6)=1px. Max=1
*   **Largest is Blue (1) with 11 pixels.** Output Pattern A. Matches.

**`train_2`:**
*   Red (2): obj1 at (0,0)=1px, obj2 at (0,3) connects (0,4), (1,1), (1,2), (1,6), (3,4), (4,6), (5,2), (6,0), (6,3), (6,4). Size = 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 11. Wait, connectivity=1 (4-way). Let's trace obj2 carefully: (0,3)-(0,4), (1,1)-(1,2), (1,6), (3,4), (4,6), (5,2), (6,0), (6,3)-(6,4). These are separate objects.
    *   Obj R1: (0,0). Size=1
    *   Obj R2: (0,3)-(0,4). Size=2
    *   Obj R3: (1,1)-(1,2). Size=2
    *   Obj R4: (1,6). Size=1
    *   Obj R5: (3,4). Size=1
    *   Obj R6: (4,6). Size=1
    *   Obj R7: (5,2). Size=1
    *   Obj R8: (6,0). Size=1
    *   Obj R9: (6,3)-(6,4). Size=2. Max Red = 2.
*   Gray (5): obj1 at (0,6)=1px. Max=1
*   Blue (1): obj1 at (2,1)=1px, obj2 at (5,3)=1px. Max=1
*   Maroon (9): obj1 at (3,6)=1px, obj2 at (4,1)=1px. Max=1
*   Azure (8): obj1 at (5,6)=1px. Max=1.
*   **Largest seems Red (2) with size 2.** (Tied with several others). Let me re-read the task carefully. Maybe connectivity is 8-way (diagonal counts)?
    *   Connectivity=2 (8-way):
        *   Red (2): Let's trace again. (0,0). (0,3)-(0,4). (1,1)-(1,2). (1,6). (3,4). (4,6). (5,2). (6,0). (6,3)-(6,4).
            *   (0,3) connects to (1,2)? Yes. (0,4) connects to nothing new.
            *   (1,1) connects to (0,0)? Yes. Connects to (1,2).
            *   (1,2) connects to (0,3), (1,1).
            *   So, {(0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,2)} is one object. Size 5.
            *   (1,6) connects to (0,6)? No (gray). (2,6)? No (white). (2,5)? No (white).
            *   (3,4) connects to (2,?) No. (4,?) No.
            *   (4,6) connects to (3,6)? Yes (Maroon=9). (5,6)? Yes (Azure=8). No red connections.
            *   (5,2) connects to (4,1)? No (Maroon=9). (6,3)? Yes.
            *   (6,0).
            *   (6,3)-(6,4) connects to (5,2).
            *   So, R_Obj1: {(0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,2)}. Size=5.
            *   R_Obj2: {(1,6)}. Size=1.
            *   R_Obj3: {(3,4)}. Size=1.
            *   R_Obj4: {(4,6)}. Size=1.
            *   R_Obj5: {(5,2), (6,3), (6,4)}. Size=3.
            *   R_Obj6: {(6,0)}. Size=1. Max Red = 5.
        *   Maroon (9): Obj M1: {(3,6), (4,1)}. Size=2? No, disconnected. Max=1.
        *   Blue (1): Obj B1: {(2,1)}. Size=1. Obj B2: {(5,3)}. Size=1. Max=1.
    *   **Using 8-way connectivity, largest is Red (2) with 5 pixels.** Output Pattern B. Matches. Let's assume 8-way connectivity.

**`train_3`:**
*   Yellow (4): (0,1), (0,4), (1,2), (6,4). Max=1.
*   Blue (1): (0,5), (2,4). Max=1.
*   Green (3): (1,0)-(1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (2,0), (2,6), (3,2), (3,4), (4,0), (4,3)-(4,4), (4,6), (5,0), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (6,0)-(6,1)-(6,2), (6,6).
    *   Let's trace (8-way):
    *   (1,0)-(1,1)-(2,0)-(3,?)No - (1,2)?Yes(Y)-(0,1)?Yes(Y).
    *   (1,1) connects to (0,1)(Y), (1,0), (1,2)(Y), (2,0).
    *   (1,3) connects to (0,4)(Y), (1,2)(Y), (2,4)(B).
    *   (1,5) connects to (0,4)(Y), (0,5)(B), (0,6)(G), (1,6)(O), (2,5)(W), (2,6)(G). Connects to (0,6) and (2,6).
    *   (2,0) connects to (1,0), (1,1), (3,0)(G). Connects to (3,0).
    *   (2,6) connects to (1,5), (1,6)(O), (3,?)No.
    *   (3,2) connects to (3,3)(W), (4,3)(G). Connects to (4,3).
    *   (3,4) connects to (2,?)No, (4,3)(G), (4,4)(G). Connects to (4,3), (4,4).
    *   (4,0) connects to (3,0)(G), (5,0)(G). Connects to (3,0), (5,0).
    *   (4,3)-(4,4) connects to (3,2), (3,4), (5,2)(G), (5,4)(G). Connects to (3,2), (3,4), (5,2), (5,4).
    *   (4,6) connects to (3,?)No, (5,6)(G). Connects to (5,6).
    *   (5,0) connects to (4,0), (6,0)(G), (6,1)(G). Connects to (4,0), (6,0), (6,1).
    *   (5,2) connects to (4,3)(G), (5,?)No, (6,1)(G), (6,2)(G). Connects to (4,3), (6,1), (6,2).
    *   (5,4) connects to (4,3)(G), (4,4)(G), (6,?)No. Connects to (4,3), (4,4).
    *   (5,6) connects to (4,6), (6,6)(G). Connects to (4,6), (6,6).
    *   (6,0)-(6,1)-(6,2) connects to (5,0), (5,2). Connects to (5,0), (5,2).
    *   (6,6) connects to (5,6). Connects to (5,6).
    *   It looks like *all* green pixels belong to a single object. Let's count them: 2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+3+1 = 21 pixels.
*   Orange (7): (1,6). Size=1.
*   Red (2): (6,5). Size=1.
*   **Largest is Green (3) with 21 pixels.** Output Pattern C. Matches.

**Conclusion:** The hypothesis seems correct. Find the largest object (using 8-way connectivity), determine its color, and output a fixed 3x3 pattern based on that color (Blue=A, Red=B, Green=C). Assume ties are broken by lower color index (though no ties were observed yet between Blue, Red, Green).

**Plan:**
1.  Define the three output patterns A, B, C.
2.  Implement object detection (connected components) using 8-way connectivity.
3.  Iterate through colors present in the input grid (excluding white/0).
4.  For each color, find all objects and their sizes.
5.  Keep track of the largest object found so far (size and color). Apply tie-breaking (lower color index wins) if sizes are equal.
6.  After checking all colors, determine the color of the overall largest object.
7.  Return the 3x3 pattern corresponding to that color.**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes a 7x7 input grid with various colors (0-9) and produces a 3x3 output grid consisting only of white (0) and azure (8).
2.  **Objects:** The input grids contain multiple contiguous areas (objects) of different colors. Connectivity appears to be 8-way (including diagonals).
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation identifies a specific property related to the objects in the input grid and maps this property to one of three predefined 3x3 azure patterns.
4.  **Key Feature:** The determining property seems to be the color of the *largest* contiguous object (measured by pixel count) within the input grid.
5.  **Color-Pattern Mapping:** There's a consistent mapping between the color of the largest object and the output pattern:
    *   If the largest object is Blue (1), the output is Pattern A: `[[0,0,8],[8,8,0],[0,8,0]]`.
    *   If the largest object is Red (2), the output is Pattern B: `[[0,0,0],[8,8,8],[0,0,0]]`.
    *   If the largest object is Green (3), the output is Pattern C: `[[0,8,8],[0,8,0],[0,8,0]]`.
6.  **Tie-breaking:** Although not explicitly demonstrated with ties between Blue, Red, and Green objects, a reasonable tie-breaking rule (e.g., choosing the color with the lower index) should be considered if objects of different relevant colors have the same maximum size. Based on analysis, 8-way connectivity is used.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Define three constant 3x3 grids (patterns) using white (0) and azure (8):
    *   `Pattern_A = [[0,0,8],[8,8,0],[0,8,0]]`
    *   `Pattern_B = [[0,0,0],[8,8,8],[0,0,0]]`
    *   `Pattern_C = [[0,8,8],[0,8,0],[0,8,0]]`
2.  Initialize variables `max_size` to -1 and `largest_object_color` to -1.
3.  Identify all unique non-white colors present in the input 7x7 grid.
4.  For each unique non-white color `C` found:
    a.  Create a binary grid where cells with color `C` are 1 and all others are 0.
    b.  Find all distinct connected components (objects) of 1s in the binary grid using 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).
    c.  Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each object of color `C`.
    d.  Find the maximum size (`current_max_size`) among objects of color `C`.
    e.  Compare `current_max_size` with `max_size`:
        i.  If `current_max_size` is greater than `max_size`, update `max_size` to `current_max_size` and set `largest_object_color` to `C`.
        ii. If `current_max_size` is equal to `max_size`, check if color `C` has a lower index than `largest_object_color`. If it does, update `largest_object_color` to `C` (this handles tie-breaking).
5.  After checking all colors, determine the final `largest_object_color`.
6.  Based on the `largest_object_color`:
    *   If `largest_object_color` is 1 (Blue), return `Pattern_A`.
    *   If `largest_object_color` is 2 (Red), return `Pattern_B`.
    *   If `largest_object_color` is 3 (Green), return `Pattern_C`.
    *   (If any other color ends up being the largest, the behavior is undefined by the examples, but based on the data, we expect it to be 1, 2, or 3).
