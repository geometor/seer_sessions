Observations:
  - Input: A 2D grid containing pixels of different colors (0-9), including a background color (0).
  - Output: A 3x3 grid.
  - Examples show inputs with multiple objects of colors Blue (1), Red (2), and Green (3).
  - The background color is White (0).
  - The output grids seem to be fixed patterns associated with specific input properties.

Assumed Objects:
  - Contiguous areas of the same non-zero color. Connectivity is assumed to be 8-way (including diagonals).

Properties:
  - Object Color: The numerical value (1, 2, or 3 are relevant based on examples).
  - Object Size: The number of pixels comprising the object.

Assumed Actions & Relationships:
  - Identify all distinct objects of colors 1, 2, and 3 in the input grid.
  - Calculate the size of each object.
  - Determine the maximum size found among all objects.
  - Identify the color(s) of the object(s) having this maximum size.
  - If multiple objects (potentially of different colors) share the maximum size, select the one with the numerically lowest color value (1 < 2 < 3).
  - Map the selected color to a specific, predefined 3x3 output pattern:
    - Color 1 (Blue) -> Pattern A (`[[0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`)
    - Color 2 (Red) -> Pattern B (`[[0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`)
    - Color 3 (Green) -> Pattern C (`[[0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0]]`)
  - The final output is the selected 3x3 pattern.

Potential Issues based on Errors:
  - Data type mismatch during output comparison in the testing environment.
  - The core logic (largest object color -> fixed pattern) might be incorrect or incomplete for some examples.
  - The assumed connectivity (8-way) or tie-breaking rule (lowest color index) might be incorrect.
