Okay, so in all examples, there is only *one* connected gray object. My previous interpretation was wrong.

Let's revisit the hypothesis: The coloring relates to the leftmost and rightmost *columns* touched by the *single* gray object. This brings us back to the original code's logic. Why did it fail so spectacularly?

Perhaps the definition of "adjacent" is wrong? The code uses 8-way adjacency. Is it 4-way?
Let's re-run the analysis for Example 1 with 4-way adjacency.

*   Leftmost gray (col 0): (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (7,0), (13,0).
*   Rightmost gray (col 4): (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (11,4), (12,4).
*   White neighbors (4-way) of col 0 gray pixels:
    *   (0,1) - adj to (0,0)
    *   (1,1) - adj to (1,0)
    *   (2,1) - adj to (2,0)
    *   (3,1) - adj to (3,0)
    *   (4,0) - adj to (3,0)
    *   (6,0) - adj to (7,0)
    *   (8,0) - adj to (7,0)
    *   (12,0) - adj to (13,0)
    *   (14,0) - adj to (13,0) <- Still the only one matching output.
*   White neighbors (4-way) of col 4 gray pixels:
    *   (0,3) - adj to (0,4)
    *   (1,3) - adj to (1,4)
    *   (2,3) - adj to (2,4)
    *   (3,4) - below (2,4)? No.
    *   (4,4) - adj to (5,4)
    *   (5,3) - adj to (5,4)
    *   (6,3) - adj to (6,4)
    *   (7,3) - adj to (7,4)
    *   (8,4) - below (7,4)? Yes.
    *   (10,4) - adj to (11,4)
    *   (11,3) - adj to (11,4)
    *   (13,4) - adj to (12,4)
*   Comparing 4-way neighbors to Expected Output 1:
    *   Orange: (14,0) matches. Others don't.
    *   Azure: Expected are (6,4), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4), (10,3), (10,4), (11,4).
        *   (6,4) white, adj (4-way) to (5,4), (7,4). MATCH.
        *   (7,4) white, adj (4-way) to (6,4), (8,4). MATCH (if (8,4) gets colored).
        *   (8,3) white, adj (4-way) to (7,3)? No. (8,2)? No. (8,4)? Yes. (9,3)? Yes. MATCH (if (8,4), (9,3) get colored).
        *   (8,4) white, adj (4-way) to (7,4), (9,4). MATCH.
        *   (9,3) white, adj (4-way) to (8,3), (10,3). MATCH (if others get colored).
        *   (9,4) white, adj (4-way) to (8,4), (10,4). MATCH (if others get colored).
        *   (10,3) white, adj (4-way) to (9,3), (11,3)? No. (10,4)? Yes. MATCH (if others).
        *   (10,4) white, adj (4-way) to (9,4), (11,4). MATCH.
        *   (11,4) white, adj (4-way) to (10,4), (12,4). MATCH.
*   This still looks like propagation/flood fill, but maybe starting *only* from the white pixels identified via 4-way adjacency to the extremal column gray pixels?

Revised Hypothesis 2:
1. Identify the single connected gray object.
2. Find the minimum (min_c) and maximum (max_c) column indices touched by this object.
3. Find the set `seed_orange`: all white pixels that are 4-way adjacent to a gray pixel (r,c) where c = min_c.
4. Find the set `seed_azure`: all white pixels that are 4-way adjacent to a gray pixel (r,c) where c = max_c.
5. Initialize `final_orange = copy(seed_orange)`, `final_azure = copy(seed_azure)`.
6. **Propagation step (using 4-way adjacency):**
    * Repeat until no changes:
        * Find all white pixels `new_orange` that are 4-way adjacent to any pixel currently in `final_orange`. Add `new_orange` to `final_orange`.
        * Find all white pixels `new_azure` that are 4-way adjacent to any pixel currently in `final_azure`. Add `new_azure` to `final_azure`.
7. Create the output grid.
8. Color pixels in `final_orange` with orange (7).
9. Color pixels in `final_azure` with azure (8) (Azure overrides orange).

Let's test this on Example 1:
*   min_c = 0, max_c = 4.
*   `seed_orange` = {(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (6,0), (8,0), (12,0), (14,0)}.
*   `seed_azure` = {(0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (4,4), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,4), (10,4), (11,3), (13,4)}.
*   Initial `final_orange` = `seed_orange`.
*   Initial `final_azure` = `seed_azure`.
*   Propagation (Orange):
    *   Neighbors of `seed_orange`: Includes (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0), (7,0)-gray, (9,0), (11,0), (13,0)-gray, (13,1), (14,1). Add white ones: {(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0), (9,0), (11,0), (13,1), (14,1)}.
    *   This orange area grows, but the expected output only has (14,0). This hypothesis is also wrong.

What is special about (14,0)? It's the only white neighbor (using 4-way or 8-way) of the leftmost column (col 0) gray pixels that actually gets colored orange.
What is special about the azure pixels? (6,4), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4), (10,3), (10,4), (11,4).

Let's re-examine the relationship between the colored pixels and the gray object.
Maybe the color "flows" from the gray object into adjacent white cells, but only in certain directions or under certain conditions?

Consider the concept of "outside". How can we define the "outside" of the gray shape?
Maybe color only white pixels that are adjacent to the gray shape *and* are "outside" some boundary?

Let's reconsider Example 2's expected output:

```
0 0 5 *7* *7* 5 *8* *8* *8*  <- Row 0
0 0 5 5 5 5 *8* *8* *8*  <- Row 1
5 5 5 *8* *8* *8* *8* *8* *8*  <- Row 2
0 5 *8* *8* *8* *8* *8* *8* *8*  <- Row 3
0 5 *8* *8* *8* 5 5 5 5  <- Row 4
0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0
5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5
0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

*   Gray object min_c=0, max_c=8.
*   Orange pixels are (0,3), (0,4). They are adjacent (8-way) to gray pixel (1,2). Is (1,2) special? It's not in the min_c=0 column.
*   Azure pixels are many. e.g., (0,6), (0,7), (0,8) are adjacent (8-way) to gray pixel (1,5). This is not in the max_c=8 column.

This completely invalidates the min/max column idea. The coloring seems related to some *other* property.

What if orange/azure are related to specific gray pixels based on their local neighborhood?
*   Maybe gray pixels that are "left-facing edges" trigger orange, and "right-facing edges" trigger azure?
    *   A gray pixel (r,c) is a "left edge" if (r, c-1) is white (or boundary).
    *   A gray pixel (r,c) is a "right edge" if (r, c+1) is white (or boundary).

Let's test this:
Example 1:
*   Left edges (gray pixel (r,c) where input(r, c-1) is white or c=0):
    *   (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (7,0), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (12,1), (13,0), (14,1).
*   Right edges (gray pixel (r,c) where input(r, c+1) is white or c=width-1):
    *   (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,2 -> (3,3) is white), (4,2 -> (4,3) is white), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,1 -> (8,2) white), (9,1 -> (9,2) white), (10,3 -> (10,4) white), (11,4), (12,4), (13,0 -> (13,1) white), (14,1 -> (14,2) white).
*   Now, find white pixels adjacent (8-way) to "left edge" gray pixels -> color orange.
    *   (14,0) is adjacent to (13,0) (left edge). -> Orange. OK.
    *   Are there others? (8,0) adj to (8,1) (left edge)? Yes. Why not orange?
*   Find white pixels adjacent (8-way) to "right edge" gray pixels -> color azure.
    *   (6,4) is adj to (5,4) (right edge). -> Azure. OK.
    *   (7,4) is adj to (6,4) (right edge), (7,4) (right edge). -> Azure. OK.
    *   (8,3) is adj to (7,4) (right edge). -> Azure. OK.
    *   (8,4) is adj to (7,4) (right edge). -> Azure. OK.
    *   ... and so on. This looks promising! It generates the correct azure pixels in Ex1.
*   Why is (8,0) not orange? It's adjacent to (8,1) which is a left-edge gray pixel. And (9,0) adj to (9,1), etc. The orange part is still not fully explained.
*   Maybe only white pixels adjacent to left-edge pixels *in the minimum column* get colored orange?
    *   Min col = 0. Left edge pixels in col 0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (7,0), (13,0).
    *   White 8-way neighbors: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (6,0), (6,1), (8,0), (8,1), (12,0), (12,1), (13,1), (14,0).
    *   Only (14,0) is orange in the output. Why? Is it the only one *below* all the gray pixels in its column? No. Is it the only one adjacent to the *lowest* left-edge pixel in that column (13,0)? Neighbors are (12,0), (12,1), (13,1), (14,0), (14,1). (12,0) and (14,0) are white neighbors. Why only (14,0)?

Let's look at the exact coordinates again.
Input Grid 1 (relevant part):

```
...
12: 0 5 5 5 5   <- gray (12,1), (12,2), (12,3), (12,4) right edge
13: 5 5 0 0 0   <- gray (13,0) left edge, (13,1)
14: 0 5 0 0 0   <- gray (14,1) left edge
```

Expected Output:

```
...
12: 0 5 5 5 5
13: 5 5 0 0 0
14: *7* 5 0 0 0   <- orange (14,0)
```

Pixel (14,0) is white.
Left edge gray pixels: (13,0), (14,1).
Right edge gray pixels: (12,4).
White neighbors of (13,0): (12,-1) OOB, (12,0) white, (12,1) gray, (13,-1) OOB, (13,1) gray, (14,-1) OOB, (14,0) white, (14,1) gray. -> White neighbors: (12,0), (14,0).
White neighbors of (14,1): (13,0) gray, (13,1) gray, (13,2) white, (14,0) white, (14,2) white, (15,0) OOB, (15,1) OOB, (15,2) OOB. -> White neighbors: (13,2), (14,0), (14,2).
White neighbors of (12,4): (11,3) white, (11,4) gray, (11,5) OOB, (12,3) gray, (12,5) OOB, (13,3) white, (13,4) white, (13,5) OOB. -> White neighbors: (11,3), (13,3), (13,4).

So:
White neighbors of ALL left-edge gray pixels: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (6,0), (6,1), (8,0), (8,1), (9,0), (9,1), (10,0), (10,2), (11,1), (11,2), (12,0), (12,2), (13,2), (14,0), (14,2).
White neighbors of ALL right-edge gray pixels: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2), (10,4), (11,3), (11,5 OOB), (12,5 OOB), (13,1), (13,2), (13,3), (13,4), (14,2).

Combining these lists with the expected output:
Expected Orange: {(14,0)}. This pixel is in the neighbor list of left-edges.
Expected Azure: {(6,4), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4), (10,3), (10,4), (11,4)}.
*   (6,4) is in the neighbor list of right-edges. OK.
*   (7,4) is NOT in the neighbor list (it's white, neighbors (6,4), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4)). Wait, (7,4) is adjacent to gray (6,4) and gray (7,4). Both are right-edges. Why wasn't it in my list? Ah, I calculated neighbors of (12,4) only. Need neighbors of ALL right-edge pixels. Let's recompute using code.

Match Orange: False
Match Azure: False

```
This "edge" hypothesis is also incorrect. The sets of neighbors calculated this way do not match the expected outputs.

Let's step back and look at the visual transformation.
Example 1: Orange appears only at the very bottom left. Azure appears clustered on the right side, roughly in the vertical middle.
Example 2: Orange appears top-middle-left. Azure appears top-middle-right and extends down and left.
Example 3: Orange appears middle-left. Azure appears middle-right.

Maybe the transformation isn't about *all* gray pixels, but about a specific subset? Or maybe the color choice depends on the *relative position* of the neighbor to the gray pixel?

Revisit Example 1:
Orange pixel (14,0) is white. It's diagonally adjacent (bottom-left) to gray pixel (13,1)? No, it's adjacent (below) gray pixel (13,0) and diagonally (bottom-left) to gray pixel (14,1). (13,0) is in the min column.
Azure pixels:
(6,4) white. Adj (above) gray (7,4). Adj (diag-top-right) gray (5,3)? No. Adj (diag-top-left) gray (5,4). Gray (7,4) and (5,4) are in max column.
(7,4) white. Adj (between) gray (6,4) and gray (8,4)? No, (8,4) is white. Adj (between) gray (6,4) and (7,3)? No. Adj (between) gray (6,4) and (7,4)? No. Adj (below) gray (6,4) and (above) gray (7,4)? It's adjacent to both. Both are in max column.
(8,3) white. Adj (diag-top-right) gray (7,4). Gray(7,4) is in max column.
(8,4) white. Adj (below) gray (7,4). Gray(7,4) is in max column.
(9,3) white. Adj (diag-bottom-right) gray (8,4)? No (8,4) is white. Adj (right) gray (9,2)? No. Adj (diag-top-right) gray (8,4)? No. Adj (below) gray (8,3)? No.
(9,4) white. Adj (below) gray (8,4)? No.
(10,3) white. Adj (diag-top-right) gray (9,4)? No. Adj (diag-bottom-left) gray (11,4). Gray (11,4) is in max column.
(10,4) white. Adj (below) gray (9,4)? No. Adj (above) gray (11,4). Gray (11,4) is in max column.
(11,4) white. Adj (below) gray (10,4)? No. Adj (above) gray (12,4). Gray (12,4) is in max column.

Let's focus on the relative position:
If a white pixel is adjacent to a gray pixel in the min column:
- If the white pixel is directly LEFT of the gray pixel (dr=0, dc=-1): Color orange?
- If the white pixel is directly RIGHT of the gray pixel (dr=0, dc=1): Color orange?
- If the white pixel is directly ABOVE the gray pixel (dr=-1, dc=0): Color orange?
- If the white pixel is directly BELOW the gray pixel (dr=1, dc=0): Color orange?
- Diagonals?

Let's test "directly left" and "directly right".
Hypothesis 3:
1. Find gray pixels. Find min_c, max_c.
2. Identify `left_gray`: gray pixels (r,c) where c=min_c.
3. Identify `right_gray`: gray pixels (r,c) where c=max_c.
4. Color orange: white pixels (r, c) where c = min_c - 1 AND (r, c+1) is in `left_gray`. (White pixel directly left of a leftmost gray pixel).
5. Color azure: white pixels (r, c) where c = max_c + 1 AND (r, c-1) is in `right_gray`. (White pixel directly right of a rightmost gray pixel).

Test on Example 1:
*   min_c=0, max_c=4. `left_gray` in col 0. `right_gray` in col 4.
*   Orange: Check white pixels (r, -1). None exist. -> No orange. Fails.

Maybe the adjacency check is still 8-way, but the *trigger* is the min/max column gray pixels? And the *color choice* depends on whether the neighbor is to the left or right side of the grid center? Or left/right relative to the gray object's center?

Let's reconsider the first idea: color white neighbors of min-column grays orange, white neighbors of max-column grays azure. Why did the code output differ so much from expected?

Compare Transformed vs Expected for Ex 1:
Transformed Output:

```
5 7 0 5 0  <- (0,1) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (0,0).
5 7 0 5 8  <- (1,1) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (1,0). (1,4) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (1,4).
5 7 5 5 5  <- (2,1) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (2,0).
5 5 5 8 8  <- (3,3) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (2,4). (3,4) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (2,4).
7 7 5 8 8  <- (4,0) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (3,0). (4,1) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (3,0). (4,3) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (5,4). (4,4) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (5,4).
0 0 5 5 5
7 7 0 5 8  <- (6,0) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (7,0). (6,1) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (7,0). (6,4) azure. Exp: AZURE. OK. Adj to (5,4), (7,4).
5 5 5 5 0
7 5 0 0 0  <- (8,0) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (7,0).
0 5 0 0 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 0 0 5 8  <- (11,4) azure. Exp: AZURE. OK. Adj to (12,4).
7 5 5 5 5  <- (12,0) orange. Exp: white. Adj to (13,0).
5 5 0 8 8  <- (13,3) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (12,4). (13,4) azure. Exp: white. Adj to (12,4).
7 5 0 0 0  <- (14,0) orange. Exp: ORANGE. OK. Adj to (13,0).
```

The code correctly identified (6,4), (11,4), (14,0). But it colored many others that were white neighbors of min/max column gray pixels. Why are those others *not* colored in the expected output?

Is there a constraint based on the overall grid or shape?
Maybe only neighbors *outside* the bounding box of the gray shape?
Ex 1 Bbox: rows 0-14, cols 0-4.
*   (14,0) is on the edge. OK.
*   (6,4) is on the edge. OK.
*   (7,4) is on the edge. OK in expected.
*   (8,3) is inside. OK in expected.
*   (8,4) is on the edge. OK in expected.
*   (9,3) is inside. OK in expected.
*   (9,4) is on the edge. OK in expected.
*   (10,3) is inside. OK in expected.
*   (10,4) is on the edge. OK in expected.
*   (11,4) is on the edge. OK in expected.
So, the bounding box constraint doesn't seem right either.

What if only *convex hull* neighbors are colored? That seems too complex.

Let's look at the colors again. Orange (7), Azure (8).
Maybe the rule involves finding *all* white 8-way neighbors of *any* gray pixel, and then coloring them based on whether they are closer to the min column or max column?

Hypothesis 4:
1. Find all gray pixels G. Find min_c, max_c over all (r,c) in G.
2. Find all white pixels WN that are 8-way adjacent to at least one pixel in G.
3. For each pixel (r, w) in WN:
    *   Find the set of adjacent gray pixels AG = {(gr, gc) in G | (r, w) is 8-way adjacent to (gr, gc)}.
    *   Check if any (gr, gc) in AG has gc == min_c. Set `is_adj_min = True` if so.
    *   Check if any (gr, gc) in AG has gc == max_c. Set `is_adj_max = True` if so.
    *   If `is_adj_max` is True, color (r, w) azure (8).
    *   Else if `is_adj_min` is True, color (r, w) orange (7).
    *   Otherwise, leave it white.

Test on Example 1:
*   min_c=0, max_c=4.
*   Consider white pixel (1,1). Adjacent gray: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).
    *   (0,0) has c=0 (min_c). `is_adj_min = True`.
    *   None have c=4 (max_c). `is_adj_max = False`.
    *   Rule: `is_adj_max` is False. `is_adj_min` is True. Color orange. -> Matches code output, but not expected output. Fails.

Let's revisit the "edge" idea but simplify it.
Hypothesis 5:
1. Find the single connected gray component.
2. Find its bounding box: min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c.
3. Identify `left_pixels`: Gray pixels (r, c) where c == min_c.
4. Identify `right_pixels`: Gray pixels (r, c) where c == max_c.
5. Find `orange_candidates`: White pixels (r, w) that are 8-way adjacent to any pixel in `left_pixels`.
6. Find `azure_candidates`: White pixels (r, w) that are 8-way adjacent to any pixel in `right_pixels`.
7. Filter `orange_final`: Keep only candidates (r, w) from `orange_candidates` where r == max_r + 1 (i.e., directly below the bounding box)? No, (14,0) is not below max_r=14. Where r == max_r? Let's try that.
    *   In Ex 1, max_r = 14. `orange_candidates` includes (14,0). Rule: keep if r==14. Keep (14,0). Are there others? Neighbor list for left_edge was `[(0, 1), (0, 2), ... (14, 0), (14, 2)]`. Candidates with r=14 are (14,0) and (14,2). Expected only has (14,0). Fails.
8. Filter `azure_final`: How to filter azure? Maybe keep only candidates between min_r and max_r?
    *   In Ex 1, min_r=0, max_r=14. `azure_candidates` (neighbors of right_edge pixels) list is long. Expected azure are rows 6-11. This range [6,11] is within [0,14]. But the rule doesn't exclude other candidates within [0,14], like (0,3), (1,3), etc. Fails.

Maybe the task involves drawing lines or shapes?
Look at the azure shape in Ex 1. It looks like a filled area. How is it defined?
It seems bounded by gray pixels on the left (col 2/3) and right (col 4), and white pixels above/below.
Points: (8,3)...(10,3), (6,4)...(11,4).
Is it filling white space between the leftmost column and the rightmost column, but only in certain rows?

What defines the rows 6-11 for the azure color in Ex 1?
Gray pixels exist in these rows:
Row 6: (6,3), (6,4)
Row 7: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)
Row 8: (8,1)
Row 9: (9,1)
Row 10: (10,1), (10,2), (10,3)
Row 11: (11,3), (11,4)
Maybe it colors the white space between min_c and max_c for rows that contain gray pixels *not* on the min_c or max_c column?
Rows with interior gray pixels: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
Let's test this:
For each row `r` from 0 to height-1:
  Check if row `r` contains any gray pixel (r, c) where min_c < c < max_c.
  If yes, then for this row `r`, iterate columns `c` from min_c + 1 to max_c - 1.
    If input(r, c) is white, color it azure (8)?
Test on Ex 1 (min_c=0, max_c=4):
*   Row 0: No interior gray.
*   Row 1: No interior gray.
*   Row 2: Interior gray at (2,1), (2,2). Iterate c from 1 to 3. input(2,1)=0 -> azure? input(2,2)=5 -> skip. input(2,3)=5 -> skip. -> Colors (2,1) azure. Not expected. Fails.

Okay, final attempt at observation:
Look at the relative structure. The gray shape defines a "left side" and a "right side". White pixels adjacent to the "left side" become orange. White pixels adjacent to the "right side" become azure.
How to define "left side" vs "right side"?
Maybe it's related to the leftmost and rightmost gray pixels *in each row*?

Hypothesis 6:
1. For each row `r`:
    *   Find the minimum column `min_c_r` and maximum column `max_c_r` containing a gray pixel in that row. If no gray pixel, skip row.
    *   Identify the gray pixel(s) at `(r, min_c_r)`. Find their 8-way white neighbors. Color these orange.
    *   Identify the gray pixel(s) at `(r, max_c_r)`. Find their 8-way white neighbors. Color these azure.
    *   Azure takes precedence.

Test on Example 1:
*   Row 0: min_c_r=0, max_c_r=3. Left=(0,0). Right=(0,3).
    *   Neighbors of (0,0): (-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1) white, (1,-1), (1,0) gray, (1,1) white. Orange candidates: (0,1), (1,1).
    *   Neighbors of (0,3): (-1,2),(-1,3),(-1,4), (0,2) white, (0,4) white, (1,2) white, (1,3) white, (1,4) gray. Azure candidates: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3).
*   Row 1: min_c_r=0, max_c_r=3. Left=(1,0). Right=(1,3).
    *   Neighbors of (1,0): (0,-1),(0,0) gray,(0,1) white, (1,-1), (1,1) white, (2,-1),(2,0) gray,(2,1) white. Orange candidates: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1).
    *   Neighbors of (1,3): (0,2) white, (0,3) gray, (0,4) white, (1,2) white, (1,4) gray, (2,2) gray, (2,3) gray, (2,4) gray. Azure candidates: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2).
... this is basically generating the same incorrect colored pixels as the original code did.

There must be a filtering condition I'm missing.

Look at the outputs again.
Ex 1: Orange (14,0). Azure patch (rows 6-11, cols 3-4).
Ex 2: Orange patch (row 0, cols 3-4). Azure patch (rows 0-4, cols 2-8).
Ex 3: Orange patch (rows 1-4, col 2). Azure patch (rows 4-9, col 7).

Maybe the colored pixels must form a rectangle? Or fill a region defined by specific gray points?

Consider the transformation's goal. It seems to be highlighting the left and right extents of the gray object, but not globally. It seems localized.

What if the colored pixels must be adjacent ONLY to the extremal gray pixels and NO OTHER gray pixels?
Test Hypothesis 4 again with this constraint.
Hypothesis 4 (Revised):
1. Find all gray pixels G. Find min_c, max_c over all (r,c) in G.
2. Find all white pixels WN that are 8-way adjacent to at least one pixel in G.
3. For each pixel P=(r, w) in WN:
    *   Find the set of adjacent gray pixels AG = {(gr, gc) in G | P is 8-way adjacent to (gr, gc)}.
    *   Check if *all* pixels (gr, gc) in AG have gc == min_c. Set `only_adj_min = True` if so.
    *   Check if *all* pixels (gr, gc) in AG have gc == max_c. Set `only_adj_max = True` if so.
    *   If `only_adj_max` is True, color P azure (8).
    *   Else if `only_adj_min` is True, color P orange (7).
    *   Otherwise, leave it white.

Test on Example 1:
*   min_c=0, max_c=4.
*   White pixel (1,1). AG = {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)}. Columns are 0, 0, 0, 1, 2. Not all are min_c. Not all are max_c. -> Leave white. (Matches expected!)
*   White pixel (14,0). AG = {(13,0), (14,1)}. Columns are 0, 1. Not all min_c. Not all max_c. -> Leave white. (Does NOT match expected!). Fails.

Let's reconsider the original code's logic and output. It seems to correctly identify the neighbors but doesn't filter them correctly. The key is the filtering condition.

What if the coloring only happens if the neighbor is "outside" the shape in a specific way? Like, a line drawn from the center of the shape through the gray pixel would hit the white neighbor?

Let's go back to the simplest working parts of the first code: finding min/max columns, finding gray pixels in those columns, finding neighbors. The problem is which neighbors to keep.

Look at the successful cases from the failed code: (6,4), (11,4), (14,0).
*   (14,0) white. Neighbors gray: (13,0) [c=0=min_c], (14,1) [c=1]. It *is* adjacent to a min_c gray.
*   (6,4) white. Neighbors gray: (5,4) [c=4=max_c], (7,4) [c=4=max_c]. It *is* adjacent to max_c grays.
*   (11,4) white. Neighbors gray: (10,4) [c=4=max_c], (12,4) [c=4=max_c]. It *is* adjacent to max_c grays.

Now look at a failed case from the code: (0,1) white. Neighbors gray: (0,0) [c=0=min_c], (1,0) [c=0=min_c], (1,1) [c=1]. It *is* adjacent to min_c grays. Code colored it orange. Expected output kept it white. Why?

Is it related to the number of gray neighbors?
(14,0) has 2 gray neighbors.
(6,4) has 2 gray neighbors.
(11,4) has 2 gray neighbors.
(0,1) has 3 gray neighbors.

Let's check other expected colored pixels:
(7,4) white. Neighbors gray: (6,4) [c=4], (7,3) [c=3], (8,3) [white in input? No, (8,3) is white]. Neighbors gray: (6,4) [c=4], (7,3) [c=3], (8,4) [white]. Recheck input grid: (7,3) is gray, (7,4) is gray. Pixel (7,4) is WHITE in input. Wait, input[7][4] is 0. OK. Adjacent gray: (6,4) [c=4], (7,3) [c=3], (8,3) [white]. Let's use code to be sure.
