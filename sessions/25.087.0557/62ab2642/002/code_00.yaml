task_description: "Color the background pixels adjacent to the leftmost and rightmost vertical extents of the gray shape(s)."
grid_properties:
  - input_output_grids_have_same_dimensions
colors:
  - gray: 5
  - white: 0 (background)
  - orange: 7 (output color)
  - azure: 8 (output color)
objects:
  - type: structure
    color: gray (5)
    description: "One or more potentially connected structures made of gray pixels."
    properties:
      - leftmost_column_index: The minimum column index occupied by any gray pixel.
      - rightmost_column_index: The maximum column index occupied by any gray pixel.
      - leftmost_pixels: All gray pixels located at the `leftmost_column_index`.
      - rightmost_pixels: All gray pixels located at the `rightmost_column_index`.
  - type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    description: "Background pixels that might be colored."
actions:
  - identify: All gray pixels in the input grid.
  - calculate: The minimum (`min_c`) and maximum (`max_c`) column indices among all gray pixels.
  - filter: Identify the set of gray pixels whose column index is `min_c` (leftmost_pixels).
  - filter: Identify the set of gray pixels whose column index is `max_c` (rightmost_pixels).
  - find_neighbors: For each pixel in `leftmost_pixels`, find all 8-way adjacent white (0) pixels. Collect these white neighbors.
  - find_neighbors: For each pixel in `rightmost_pixels`, find all 8-way adjacent white (0) pixels. Collect these white neighbors.
  - color: Change the collected white neighbors of `leftmost_pixels` to orange (7) in the output grid.
  - color: Change the collected white neighbors of `rightmost_pixels` to azure (8) in the output grid. (Azure takes precedence if a pixel neighbors both sets).
constraints:
  - If no gray pixels exist, or if `min_c` equals `max_c` (the gray structure is only 1 column wide), the grid remains unchanged. # Implicit assumption, needs verification if such cases exist. The examples suggest min_c != max_c.
  - Adjacency includes diagonals (8-way).
  - Azure (8) coloring takes precedence over orange (7) coloring if a white pixel is adjacent to both leftmost and rightmost gray pixels.
