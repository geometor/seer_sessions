            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided code consistently fails to produce the expected output for all training examples, returning the input grid unchanged. The core logic intends to identify the leftmost and rightmost gray (5) objects, find their adjacent white (0) neighbors (including diagonals), and color them orange (7) for the leftmost and azure (8) for the rightmost, with azure taking precedence.\n\nThe fact that *no* pixels are changed strongly suggests that the condition `if len(gray_objects) < 2:` is evaluating to `True` in all examples, causing the function to return prematurely. This could happen if:\n1.  The `find_objects` function is not correctly identifying distinct gray objects.\n2.  The `find_objects` function *is* finding objects, but due to connectivity (perhaps diagonal), visually separate clusters are being identified as a single object, resulting in fewer than two objects being found overall.\n\nThe immediate strategy is to verify how many distinct gray objects the `find_objects` function identifies in each example and determine their boundaries.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's use code execution to determine the number of gray objects found by the `find_objects` function in each example input.\n"

The transformation rule needs to be redefined based on identifying these visually distinct *parts* or *extents* of the gray structure(s), rather than strictly separate connected components.\n\nA better approach might be:\n\n1.  Find *all* gray pixels.\n2.  Determine the minimum column index (`min_c_overall`) and maximum column index (`max_c_overall`) occupied by *any* gray pixel.\n3.  Identify all gray pixels located at `min_c_overall`. These constitute the \"leftmost part\".\n4.  Identify all gray pixels located at `max_c_overall`. These constitute the \"rightmost part\".\n5.  Find white neighbors (8-way adjacent) of the \"leftmost part\" pixels and color them orange.\n6.  Find white neighbors (8-way adjacent) of the \"rightmost part\" pixels and color them azure.\n7.  Apply azure precedence if a white pixel neighbors both parts.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
