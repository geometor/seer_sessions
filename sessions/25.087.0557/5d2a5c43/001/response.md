1.  Identify the vertical blue line (color 1) in the input grid, which acts as a separator.
2.  Divide the input grid into two subgrids based on the separator: the "left subgrid" (columns to the left of the separator) and the "right subgrid" (columns to the right of the separator).
3.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the left (or right) subgrid.
4.  Iterate through each cell position (row `r`, column `c`) within the dimensions of the subgrids.
5.  For each position (`r`, `c`):
    a.  Check the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the left subgrid.
    b.  Check the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the right subgrid.
    c.  If the color in the left subgrid is yellow (4) OR the color in the right subgrid is yellow (4), set the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to azure (8).
    d.  Otherwise (if both corresponding cells in the left and right subgrids are white (0)), set the color of the cell at (`r`, `c`) in the output grid to white (0).
6.  Return the completed output grid.
