The shape and size of this new red object exactly match the original red object.\n    *   The position of the new red object relative to the gray pixel is different from the original red object's position relative to the gray pixel.\n*   **Relationship:** The core of the transformation seems to involve the spatial relationship between the red object(s) and the gray pixel. Specifically, it looks like a rotation. Observing the relative coordinates of the red pixels with respect to the gray pixel, the transformation corresponds to a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the gray pixel. The original red pixels change color in place, and the rotated shape is drawn with red pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
