Okay, I will analyze the provided ARC task examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are 2D grids of varying sizes.
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0 - background), red (2), green (3), and gray (5).
*   **Objects:**
    *   A single, static gray pixel (5) seems to act as a reference point or pivot.
    *   One or more red pixels (2), often forming a contiguous shape (line or rectangle), are present in the input.
*   **Transformation:**
    *   The original red pixels always change color to green (3) in the output, maintaining their original positions.
    *   A new set of red pixels appears in the output. The shape and size of this new red object exactly match the original red object.
    *   The position of the new red object relative to the gray pixel is different from the original red object's position relative to the gray pixel.
*   **Relationship:** The core of the transformation seems to involve the spatial relationship between the red object(s) and the gray pixel. Specifically, it looks like a rotation. Observing the relative coordinates of the red pixels with respect to the gray pixel, the transformation corresponds to a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the gray pixel. The original red pixels change color in place, and the rotated shape is drawn with red pixels.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a grid based on the interaction between a red object and a gray pivot pixel."
elements:
  - element: background
    color: white (0)
    role: "Fills empty space."
  - element: pivot
    color: gray (5)
    count: 1
    properties:
      - static
      - acts as a center for rotation
    role: "Reference point for the transformation."
  - element: primary_object
    color: red (2)
    count: "one or more, possibly forming a contiguous shape"
    properties:
      - changes color to green (3) in place
      - its shape and relative position to the pivot determine the location of the secondary_object
    role: "The object being transformed."
  - element: secondary_object
    color: red (2)
    count: "same number of pixels as primary_object"
    properties:
      - shape matches the primary_object
      - appears in the output grid
      - position is determined by rotating the primary_object's position 90 degrees clockwise around the pivot
    role: "The result of the positional transformation."
  - element: transformed_object
    color: green (3)
    count: "same number of pixels as primary_object"
    properties:
      - occupies the original position of the primary_object
    role: "The result of the color transformation."
actions:
  - action: identify_pivot
    input: grid
    target: gray (5) pixel
    output: coordinates of the pivot (gr, gc)
  - action: identify_primary_object
    input: grid
    target: red (2) pixels
    output: list of coordinates {(r, c)} for all red pixels
  - action: color_change
    input_pixels: primary_object coordinates {(r, c)}
    output_grid: modify pixel at (r, c)
    new_color: green (3)
  - action: rotate_and_place
    input_pixels: primary_object coordinates {(r, c)}
    pivot: pivot coordinates (gr, gc)
    output_grid: modify pixels at calculated new positions
    new_color: red (2)
    logic: |
      For each input red pixel (r, c):
      1. Calculate relative position: dx = r - gr, dy = c - gc
      2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise: new_dx = dy, new_dy = -dx
      3. Calculate new absolute position: new_r = gr + new_dx, new_c = gc + new_dy
      4. Place red pixel at (new_r, new_c) if within bounds.
relationships:
  - relationship: rotation
    subject: primary_object
    object: secondary_object

    details: "The secondary_object's position is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the primary_object's position around the pivot."
  - relationship: color_replacement

    details: "The transformed_object replaces the primary_object at its original location by changing its color from red to green."

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a direct copy of the input grid.
2.  Locate the single gray pixel (color 5) in the input grid and record its row and column coordinates (`gr`, `gc`).
3.  Find all red pixels (color 2) in the input grid and record their coordinates `(r, c)`.
4.  For each identified red pixel at coordinates `(r, c)`:
    a.  Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to green (color 3).
    b.  Calculate the relative position of this red pixel with respect to the gray pivot: `dx = r - gr`, `dy = c - gc`.
    c.  Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation transformation on the relative coordinates: `new_dx = dy`, `new_dy = -dx`.
    d.  Calculate the new absolute coordinates in the grid where the rotated pixel should appear: `new_r = gr + new_dx`, `new_c = gc + new_dy`.
    e.  Check if the calculated coordinates (`new_r`, `new_c`) are within the bounds of the grid.
    f.  If the coordinates are within bounds, change the color of the pixel at (`new_r`, `new_c`) in the *output* grid to red (color 2).
