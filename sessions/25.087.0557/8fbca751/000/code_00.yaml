task_description: "Color adjacent white pixels based on proximity to azure pixels."
elements:
  - type: background
    color: white (0)
  - type: object
    color: azure (8)
    description: "Forms shapes or clusters in the input grid."
  - type: added_pixels

    description: "Appears in the output grid in locations that were white in the input."
transformation:
  action: "Coloring"
  source_pixels: "White (0) pixels in the input."
  target_pixels: "Red (2) pixels in the output."
  condition:
    - "The input pixel must be white (0)."
    - "The input pixel must be orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one azure (8) pixel."
relationships:
  - "Azure (8) pixels remain unchanged between input and output."
  - "White (0) pixels not meeting the adjacency condition remain unchanged."
  - "Red (2) pixels only appear where the adjacency condition is met for a white pixel."
grid_properties:
  - "Grid size can vary."
  - "The relative positions of azure (8) pixels are preserved."
