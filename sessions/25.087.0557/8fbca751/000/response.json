The azure objects can be disconnected or connected, forming various shapes.\n2.  **Output Grid:** Contains the original azure (8) objects and white (0) background pixels from the input. Additionally, some pixels that were originally white (0) in the input have been changed to red (2) in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves adding red (2) pixels to the grid. The placement of these red pixels appears to be directly related to the position of the azure (8) pixels.\n4.  **Key Observation:** Red pixels appear exclusively in locations that were originally white (0) in the input grid. Furthermore, these red pixels are always orthogonally adjacent (sharing a side, not just a corner) to at least one azure (8) pixel. Pixels that were already azure (8) remain unchanged. White pixels not orthogonally adjacent to any azure pixels also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Iterate through each pixel (cell) of the input grid, identifying its row and column index.\n3.  For the current pixel at `(row, col)`:\n    a.  Check if the color of the pixel in the *input* grid is white (0).\n    b.  If it is white (0), then examine its orthogonal neighbors (the pixels directly above, below, left, and right, if they exist within the grid boundaries).\n    c.  Check if any of these orthogonal neighbors in the *input* grid have the color azure (8).\n    d.  If at least one orthogonal neighbor is azure (8), change the color of the pixel at `(row, col)` in the *output* grid to red (2).\n    e.  If the input pixel is not white (0), or if it is white (0) but none of its orthogonal neighbors are azure (8), the corresponding pixel in the output grid keeps its original color (which was set during the initial copy).\n4.  After checking all pixels, the final output grid contains the result of the transformation."
