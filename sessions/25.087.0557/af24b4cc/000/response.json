            "text": "Okay, let's break down this ARC task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Grid Structure:** The input grids are consistently 9 rows by 10 columns. They feature a 'white' background (color 0). Within this background, there are six distinct areas containing non-white pixels. These areas seem to be structured around 3x3 regions. These six regions are arranged in a 2x3 layout within the larger grid. Specifically, they are centered approximately at row 2 / column 2, row 2 / column 5, row 2 / column 8, row 6 / column 2, row 6 / column 5, and row 6 / column 8. The pixels within these regions form small clusters, often resembling noisy 2x2 squares.\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grids are smaller, consistently 4 rows by 5 columns. They also have a 'white' background. Non-white pixels appear only at six specific locations: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). This forms a 2x3 pattern within the 4x5 grid.\n3.  **Relationship:** There is a clear spatial correspondence between the 2x3 arrangement of the active regions in the input and the 2x3 arrangement of the colored pixels in the output. It appears that each of the six input regions maps to a single pixel in the output.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core task seems to be summarizing the information within each of the six 3x3 input regions into a single color value and placing that value into the corresponding location in the smaller output grid. Observing the examples, the rule for determining the output color for each region is to find the non-white color that appears most frequently within that 3x3 region.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
