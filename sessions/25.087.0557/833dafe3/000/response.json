            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Size Transformation**: The most immediate observation is that the output grid's dimensions (height and width) are exactly double the input grid's dimensions. In train_1, a 3x3 input becomes a 6x6 output. In train_2, a 4x4 input becomes an 8x8 output.\n2.  **Symmetry and Reflection**: The output grid exhibits a clear pattern of symmetry. It appears to be composed of four quadrants, each being a transformation of the original input grid.\n3.  **Quadrant Analysis**:\n    *   Let the input grid dimensions be H x W. The output grid dimensions are 2H x 2W.\n    *   The **bottom-right quadrant** (rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1) of the output grid is identical to the original input grid.\n    *   The **bottom-left quadrant** (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1) appears to be a horizontal reflection (mirrored left-to-right) of the original input grid.\n    *   The **top-right quadrant** (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1) appears to be a vertical reflection (mirrored top-to-bottom) of the original input grid.\n    *   The **top-left quadrant** (rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1) appears to be both horizontally and vertically reflected (equivalent to a 180-degree rotation) version of the original input grid.\n4.  **Object Persistence**: All colors (pixels) present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, just rearranged and duplicated according to the reflection rules. No new colors are introduced, and no colors are removed entirely (unless the input was a single color). The structure is purely geometric rearrangement.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a horizontally reflected version of the input grid (flip it left-to-right). Place this reflected grid into the bottom-left quadrant of the output grid (rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1).\n5.  Create a vertically reflected version of the input grid (flip it top-to-bottom). Place this reflected grid into the top-right quadrant of the output grid (rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1).\n6.  Create a version of the input grid that is reflected both horizontally and vertically (or rotated 180 degrees).
