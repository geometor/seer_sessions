task_description: Construct a larger grid by reflecting the input grid into four quadrants.

elements:
  - element: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: H
      - width: W
  - element: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: 2H
      - width: 2W

relationships:
  - relationship: size_doubling
    between: [input_grid, output_grid]
    detail: Output grid dimensions are twice the input grid dimensions.
  - relationship: quadrant_composition
    of: output_grid
    detail: Output grid is composed of four quadrants, each derived from the input grid.

actions:
  - action: place_original
    input: input_grid
    output: bottom_right_quadrant_of_output
    location: rows H to 2H-1, columns W to 2W-1
  - action: reflect_horizontally
    input: input_grid
    output: bottom_left_quadrant_of_output
    location: rows H to 2H-1, columns 0 to W-1
  - action: reflect_vertically
    input: input_grid
    output: top_right_quadrant_of_output
    location: rows 0 to H-1, columns W to 2W-1
  - action: reflect_horizontally_and_vertically
    input: input_grid
    output: top_left_quadrant_of_output
    location: rows 0 to H-1, columns 0 to W-1
