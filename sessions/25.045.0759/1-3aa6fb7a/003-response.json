For the leftmost block, locate the topmost cell of color azure. Change the color of the cell immediately to its right to blue (1). For the next blocks (if any), locate the bottommost cell of color azure. Change the color of the cell at the same position to blue (1).\n\n**Step-by-step transformation:**\n\n1. **Identify vertical blocks of azure (8):**\n   - Block 1: Column 4, Rows 0-1 (coordinates: (0,4), (1,4))\n   - Block 2: Column 2, Rows 2-3 (coordinates: (2,2), (3,2))\n   - Block 3: Column 4, Rows 5-6 (coordinates: (5,4), (6,4))\n\n2. **Order blocks by column index:**\n   - Block 2 (column 2) is first.\n   - Block 1 (column 4) is second.\n   - Block 3 (column 4) is third.\n   - Actually, blocks 1 and 3 are in the same column, so we need to consider the order of blocks based on their starting column index. If columns are the same, then order does not matter for the rule as described. Let's re-examine.  Order blocks from left to right, so based on their column index only.\n   - Block 2 (column 2) is first.\n   - Block 1 (column 4) is second.\n   - Block 3 (column 4) is third.\n\n3. **Process the first block (Block 2, column 2):**\n   - Find the topmost azure cell: (2,2)\n   - Change the color of the cell to its right (2, 3) to blue (1).\n\n4. **Process the second block (Block 1, column 4):**\n   - Find the bottommost azure cell: (1,4)\n   - Change the color of the cell at the same position (1, 4) to blue (1).\n\n5. **Process the third block (Block 3, column 4):**\n   - Find the bottommost azure cell: (6,4)\n   - Change the color of the cell at the same position (6, 4) to blue (1).\n\nThis step-by-step transformation matches the observed change from input to output."
