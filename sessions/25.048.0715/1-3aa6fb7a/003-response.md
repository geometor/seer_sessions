Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in the second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects of different shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1).

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]
      shape: Several azure objects of different shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x1).
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2,3), (5,3)]
      shape: three 1x1 blue objects.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.

2.  **Change the color of particular azure objects:**
      *   Locate the object which has the top-right azure element. Then, change the element's color to blue.

      * Locate the object which has the top-left azure element. Then, change the element's color to blue.

      *   Locate the object which has the bottom-left azure element. Then, change the element's color to blue.

3.  **Preserve other objects:** All other objects outside of those specified are to remain.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation consists of changing to blue, the top-right most, top-left most, and bottom-left most elements of azure color. While preserving all of the other elements.
