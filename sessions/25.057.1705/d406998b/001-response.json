The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of gray pixels with green pixels. The white pixels remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears crucial. It is important to investigate if there is a conditional statement here.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For example:\n           - the gray at 0,0 (top, left) is unchanged\n           - the gray at 0,2 is unchanged\n           - the gray at 0,5 changes to green\n        It is similar to a find and replace, but only in certain positions.\n  - hypothesis:\n      The transformation rule likely depends on the position and/or surrounding pixels of the gray cells and could include:\n          - if gray is at an index divisible by 3, replace gray by green\n\n```"
