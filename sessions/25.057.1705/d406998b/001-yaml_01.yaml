facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (3x10).
  - object: |
      Pixels are the fundamental objects, characterized by their color value.
  - property: |
      Colors observed: gray (5), white (0), and green (3).
  - transformation: |
      Some gray (5) pixels are replaced by green (3) pixels.
  - invariance: |
      White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
  - relationship: |
        The spatial positions of the changed pixels are key. For example:
           - the gray at 0,0 (top, left) is unchanged
           - the gray at 0,2 is unchanged
           - the gray at 0,5 changes to green
        It is similar to a find and replace, but only in certain positions.
  - hypothesis:
      The transformation rule likely depends on the position and/or surrounding pixels of the gray cells and could include:
          - if gray is at an index divisible by 3, replace gray by green
