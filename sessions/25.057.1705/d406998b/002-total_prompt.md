## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7778514432F0>

**output:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3
0 3 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of gray pixels with green pixels. The white pixels remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears crucial. It is important to investigate if there is a conditional statement here.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (3x10).
  - object: |
      Pixels are the fundamental objects, characterized by their color value.
  - property: |
      Colors observed: gray (5), white (0), and green (3).
  - transformation: |
      Some gray (5) pixels are replaced by green (3) pixels.
  - invariance: |
      White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
  - relationship: |
        The spatial positions of the changed pixels are key. For example:
           - the gray at 0,0 (top, left) is unchanged
           - the gray at 0,2 is unchanged
           - the gray at 0,5 changes to green
        It is similar to a find and replace, but only in certain positions.
  - hypothesis:
      The transformation rule likely depends on the position and/or surrounding pixels of the gray cells and could include:
          - if gray is at an index divisible by 3, replace gray by green

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the pixel's color is gray (5).
3.  **If** the pixel is gray, and its horizontal position/index in the row is greater or equal to 5, and divisible by 3, then **replace** the pixel's color with green (3).
4.  **Otherwise**, keep the pixel's original color.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

Essentially - traverse the array, and replace some of the gray pixels with
green, dependent on the column index.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
