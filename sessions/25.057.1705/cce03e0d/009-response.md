Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation function to the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved replicating a 3x3 grid in the top-right (rotated 90 degrees clockwise) and bottom-left (rotated 270 degrees clockwise) corners of a 9x9 output grid. The provided code implements this.

Testing revealed that the transformation worked perfectly only on the example
it was trained on. The other train examples failed.

We need a more general approach that accounts for different grid sizes,
different amounts and type of rotation, and potentially different object
structure and placement. We will analyze the specifics of each input-output
pair to figure out the underlying rule, starting by examining how it failed the
other test cases.

The strategy is as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** For each input/output pair, determine the dimensions of the input and output grids. Identify the colors and positions of significant features (e.g., non-zero pixels).
2.  **Identify Objects and Actions:** Describe the input and output grids in terms of objects and their transformations. This includes identifying rotations, translations, scaling, or other operations.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the observations, formulate a more comprehensive and accurate natural language program that captures the general transformation rule.
4.  **Consider Core Priors**: Keep in mind Objectness, Goal-directedness, Counting, and Basic Geometry when deriving the transformations.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here, I'll analyze each training example provided and the results of the previously implemented transformation.

**Example 1**

*   Input Grid: 3x3
*   Output Grid: 9x9
*   Result: Pass

**Example 2**

*   Input Grid: 3x3
*   Output Grid: 3x3
*   Result: Fail

```python
import numpy as np
input_grid = np.array([[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0]])
expected_output_grid = np.array([[5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5]])
output_grid = np.array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 5.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 5., 5., 5.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 5., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 5., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [5., 5., 5., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 5., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])

# compare element by element - count the errors
errors = np.sum(expected_output_grid != output_grid[:3,:3])

print(f"{errors=}")
```

```
errors=4
```

The input grid is composed of gray pixels in a cross shape. The output grid has the vertical line of the cross on the left and right sides, with the intersection removed.

**Example 3**

*   Input: 2x2
*   Output: 2x2
*   Result: Fail

```python
import numpy as np
input_grid = np.array([[1, 7], [7, 8]])
expected_output_grid = np.array([[7, 8], [1, 7]])
output_grid = np.array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 7., 8., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [7., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [8., 7., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])

# compare element by element - count the errors
errors = np.sum(expected_output_grid != output_grid[:2,:2])

print(f"{errors=}")
```

```
errors=4
```

The output is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

**YAML Block: Facts**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    size: 3x3
    object: "A 3x3 grid with various colors."
  output:
    size: 9x9
    object: "A 9x9 grid with rotated copies of the input."
  action: "Replication with 90 and 270 degree rotations."

example_2:
  input:
    size: 3x3
    object: gray cross
    colors: {5: 'gray'}
  output:
    size: 3x3
    object: two vertical gray lines
    colors: {5: 'gray'}
  action: remove center intersection

example_3:
  input:
    size: 2x2
    object: 2x2 grid
    colors: {1: blue, 7: orange, 8: azure}
  output:
    size: 2x2
    object: 2x2 grid
    colors: {1: blue, 7: orange, 8: azure}
  action: rotate 90 degrees clockwise
```

**Natural Language Program**

Based on the observations, the following natural language programs are proposed:

**Attempt 1**

Based on the most complete example that worked (example 1)

1.  The input grid is replicated in the output grid.
2.  One copy is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and placed in the top-right corner.
3.  Another copy is rotated 270 degrees clockwise and placed in the bottom-left corner.
4. The rest of the grid is black

**Attempt 2**

Combine all the information to create a more general program.

1. If the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9, do the steps from Attempt 1
2. If input and output is 3x3, take the non-black pixels that form a cross,
   remove the intersection, and create vertical lines on the left and right
3. If the input and output are 2x2, rotate the entire grid by 90 degress
   clockwise

This program would solve all 3 training problems, but is probably not accurate
because it is too specific and depends on the exact size of the grids.

**Attempt 3**

This will require a complete revision of the code

1. check to see if the output is a multiple of the input on each dimension.
2. if it is - do the replication from attempt 1, using the multiplication factor
   to determine the location of the replications and setting all other pixels
   to black
3. If the input and output sizes are the same, determine the number of 90 degree
   rotations needed to transform the input to output.
4. If there are no rotations, assume we need to detect a cross, remove its
   intersection, and put the vertical components on the left and right.
