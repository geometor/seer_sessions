The smaller grid appears to be replicated and tiled within the larger grid, with the addition of '0' (white) pixels filling the spaces between the replications. The colors within the original grid are preserved. The transformation seems to involve a form of patterned replication or expansion.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This means placing copies of the input grid at positions (0,0), (0,6), (3,3), and (6,0), (6,3), and (6,6) in the output grid. These coordinates represent the top left corners.\n3. **Fill:** Fill all remaining (empty) cells in the 9x9 output grid with '0' (white pixels).\n\nEssentially, the input grid acts as a tile that is repeated to partially construct a larger grid. The process appears to use coordinate multiplication by the factor of 3, creating a 3 fold expansion.\n"
