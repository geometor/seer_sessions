Example 1:
  Input Dimensions: (3, 3)
  Output Dimensions: (9, 9)
  Scaling Factor: (3, 3)  (9/3, 9/3)
  Fill Value: 0 (white)
  Result: Correct

Example 2:
  Input Dimensions: (3, 3)
  Output Dimensions: (6, 6)
  Scaling Factor: (2, 2) (6/3, 6/3)
  Fill Value: 0 (white)
  Result: Incorrect (output should be 6x6, filled with the replicated 3x3 input, other parts filled with 0)

Example 3:
  Input Dimensions: (1, 1)
  Output Dimensions: (30, 30) - all zeros
  Scaling Factor: (30, 30) - could also be considered (1,1)
  Fill Value: 0 (white)
  Result: Incorrect, follows the rule but the input grid is all zeros, so the whole grid stays filled with 0.

Example 4:
Input Dimensions: (2, 2)
Output Dimensions: (4, 4)
Scaling Factor: (2,2)
Fill Value: 0
Result: Incorrect

Example 5:
Input Dimensions: (1, 2)
Output Dimensions: (2, 4)
Scaling Factor: (2,2)
Fill Value: 0
Result: Incorrect
