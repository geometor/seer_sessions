## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 1 2
1 1 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7778514422B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix containing single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix, also containing single-digit integers. The core transformation seems to involve expanding and repositioning the contents of the input grid within the output grid. There's a clear spatial relationship; the input grid seems to be replicated in the top-right and bottom-left corners of the output grid, rotated. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros (white).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    property: color_coded
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9)
    property: color_coded
  - relation: spatial_mapping
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    type: replication_with_rotation_and_padding
    details: |
      The input grid is replicated twice within the output grid.
      One replication is placed in the top-right corner.
      Another replication is placed at bottom-left coner.
      The source is rotated 90 degrees clock-wise at top-right.
      The source is rotated 270 degrees clock-wise or 90 counter clock-wise at bottom-left
      Remaining cells in the output grid are filled with 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with zeros (representing the color white).

2.  **Top-Right Replication:** Copy the 3x3 input grid into the top-right corner (positions (0,6), (0,7), (0,8) ,(1,6), (1,7), (1,8) ,(2,6), (2,7) and (2,8) of the output grid. Rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise.

3.  **Bottom-Left Replication:** Copy the 3x3 input grid into the bottom-left corner of the output grid (positions (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2) ,(8,0), (8,1) and (8,2) of the output grid). Rotate the input 270 degrees clockwise.

4. **Output:** the resulting 9x9 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
