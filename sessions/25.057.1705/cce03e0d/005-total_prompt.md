Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is embedded into a larger output grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by multiplying the input grid's dimensions: the output width is twice the input width plus one, and the output height is three times the input height. The input grid is placed at the top-left corner of the second 'band' of rows, and the rest of the grid is filled with white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get input dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate output dimensions
    output_height = input_height * 3
    output_width = input_width * 2 + 1

    # Create an output grid filled with white (0).
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Calculate the starting row index for embedding.
    start_row = input_height
    start_col = 0

    # Embed the input grid into the output grid.
    output_grid[start_row:start_row + input_height, start_col:start_col + input_width] = input_grid

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
