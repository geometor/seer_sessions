Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. For each pixel, check its color.
If a pixel is blue (1) or red (2) AND it is in the second row (index 1): 
extend the pixel to the right by one position, changing the color of the cell to the right.
Otherwise, the pixel remains unchanged. Output the modified grid.
