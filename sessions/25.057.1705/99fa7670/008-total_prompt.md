## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 6 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851443D90>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 6 6
0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851443C50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single magenta (6) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid retains the central magenta pixel but adds two more magenta pixels: one to the right of the center and one below the center.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    color: white
    value: 0

  - type: pixel
    color: magenta
    value: 6

actions:
  - type: copy
    description: Copy the original magenta pixel to the same location in the output grid.
  - type: add
    description: Add a magenta pixel to the right of the original magenta.
  - type: add
    description: Add a magenta pixel below the original magenta.

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains a single magenta pixel in the center.
  - output_grid: Contains three magenta pixels - original, and two additional.
  - spatial: Additional pixels added adjacent to the original, to the right, and below.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the magenta (6) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Copy** that magenta pixel to the same position in the output grid.
3. **Add** one magenta pixel in the output grid to the right of the original magenta pixel.
4. **Add** another magenta pixel in the output grid directly below the original magenta pixel.
5. Leave all the rest pixels of grid as white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
