            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the natural language program and the resulting code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code (not shown, but implied by `previous_results`) seems to have correctly captured the core pattern of repeating the sequence \"2, 8, 3\" (red, azure, green). It appears to be extending this sequence across the entire output grid, regardless of the input grid's dimensions.  The `analyze_results` function confirms that the generated outputs match the expected outputs for all three training examples. This is a good starting point, as it indicates a basic understanding of the pattern. The strategy now is to refine the code by making minimal changes to increase the chance of generalization to unknown test input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from `analyze_results` output):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the analysis provided:\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"example_index\": 0,\n        \"input_shape\": (9, 9),\n        \"output_shape\": (9, 9),\n        \"correct\": True,\n        \"error_rate\": 0.0\n    },\n    {\n        \"example_index\": 1,\n        \"input_shape\": (12, 15),\n        \"output_shape\": (12, 15),\n        \"correct\": True,\n        \"error_rate\": 0.0\n    },\n    {\n        \"example_index\": 2,\n        \"input_shape\": (7, 7),\n        \"output_shape\": (7, 7),\n        \"correct\": True,\n        \"error_rate\": 0.0\n    }\n]\n```\n\n*   **Example 0:** Input (9x9), Output (9x9), Correct: True, Error Rate: 0.0\n*   **Example 1:** Input (12x15), Output (12x15), Correct: True, Error Rate: 0.0\n*   **Example 2:** Input (7x7), Output (7x7), Correct: True, Error Rate: 0.0\n\nAll examples were solved correctly. The output dimensions always match the input, and the \"2, 8, 3\" pattern is correctly replicated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - type: pattern\n    description: \"The output grid consistently displays a repeating sequence of colors: red (2), azure (8), and green (3).\"\n    details: \"The sequence starts at the top-left corner and continues horizontally and then vertically, wrapping as needed.\"\n\n  - type: input_output_relationship\n    description: \"The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions.\"\n    details: \"For every input grid of size (H, W), the output grid is also (H, W).\"\n\n  - type: object_identification\n    description: single object composed of repeating pixels\n    properties:\n        colors: [2, 8, 3]\n        pattern: repeating sequence\n        size: \"same as input\"\n\n  - type: transformation\n    description: create a grid of the same dimensions and apply the repeating sequence\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Obtain Input Dimensions:** Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid with the same dimensions (H, W) as the input grid.\n3.  **Populate with Pattern:** Fill the output grid with the repeating sequence \"2, 8, 3\" (red, azure, green). Start at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0). Continue filling row by row, wrapping to the next row when the end of a row is reached.\n4.  **Return the output**\n\nThis program accurately describes the transformation observed in all three training examples. The key is the replication of the \"2, 8, 3\" pattern across an output grid that matches the input grid's size.\n"
