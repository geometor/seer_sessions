Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the natural language program and the resulting code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code (not shown, but implied by `previous_results`) seems to have correctly captured the core pattern of repeating the sequence "2, 8, 3" (red, azure, green). It appears to be extending this sequence across the entire output grid, regardless of the input grid's dimensions.  The `analyze_results` function confirms that the generated outputs match the expected outputs for all three training examples. This is a good starting point, as it indicates a basic understanding of the pattern. The strategy now is to refine the code by making minimal changes to increase the chance of generalization to unknown test input.

**Metrics and Observations (from `analyze_results` output):**

Here's a breakdown of the analysis provided:

```
[
    {
        "example_index": 0,
        "input_shape": (9, 9),
        "output_shape": (9, 9),
        "correct": True,
        "error_rate": 0.0
    },
    {
        "example_index": 1,
        "input_shape": (12, 15),
        "output_shape": (12, 15),
        "correct": True,
        "error_rate": 0.0
    },
    {
        "example_index": 2,
        "input_shape": (7, 7),
        "output_shape": (7, 7),
        "correct": True,
        "error_rate": 0.0
    }
]
```

*   **Example 0:** Input (9x9), Output (9x9), Correct: True, Error Rate: 0.0
*   **Example 1:** Input (12x15), Output (12x15), Correct: True, Error Rate: 0.0
*   **Example 2:** Input (7x7), Output (7x7), Correct: True, Error Rate: 0.0

All examples were solved correctly. The output dimensions always match the input, and the "2, 8, 3" pattern is correctly replicated.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - type: pattern
    description: "The output grid consistently displays a repeating sequence of colors: red (2), azure (8), and green (3)."
    details: "The sequence starts at the top-left corner and continues horizontally and then vertically, wrapping as needed."

  - type: input_output_relationship
    description: "The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions."
    details: "For every input grid of size (H, W), the output grid is also (H, W)."

  - type: object_identification
    description: single object composed of repeating pixels
    properties:
        colors: [2, 8, 3]
        pattern: repeating sequence
        size: "same as input"

  - type: transformation
    description: create a grid of the same dimensions and apply the repeating sequence

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Obtain Input Dimensions:** Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid with the same dimensions (H, W) as the input grid.
3.  **Populate with Pattern:** Fill the output grid with the repeating sequence "2, 8, 3" (red, azure, green). Start at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0). Continue filling row by row, wrapping to the next row when the end of a row is reached.
4.  **Return the output**

This program accurately describes the transformation observed in all three training examples. The key is the replication of the "2, 8, 3" pattern across an output grid that matches the input grid's size.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
