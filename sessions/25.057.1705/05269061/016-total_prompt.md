Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies the sequence of non-zero pixels in the input grid and uses this sequence to fill the output grid in a checkerboard pattern.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by extending the non-zero values into a checkerboard pattern
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # 1. Identify Non-Zero Values and Their Positions:
    non_zero_values = []
    non_zero_positions = []
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r,c] != 0:
                non_zero_values.append(input_grid[r, c])
                non_zero_positions.append((r,c))


    # 2 & 3. Checkerboard Fill using sequence:
    seq_length = len(non_zero_values)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            output_grid[r,c] = non_zero_values[(r+c) % seq_length]

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the observation of a checkerboard pattern emerging from the sequence of non-zero pixels. While this worked for the first example, it fails to accurately capture the transformations in the subsequent examples. The core issue is that the initial program assumes a simple checkerboard pattern based on the *entire* grid, using `(r+c) % seq_length`. The other examples show different behaviors, including cases where the output grid dimensions differ from the input, and where the filling pattern is not a strict checkerboard, but is based on replicating input objects.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Object Identification**: Analyze each example pair to identify distinct objects within both input and output grids. Focus on contiguous regions of the same color.
2.  **Relationship Mapping**: Determine how input objects relate to output objects. Are they copied, resized, moved, or altered in color?
3.  **Pattern Recognition**: Identify any repeating patterns or rules governing the transformation.
4.  **Refine Program**: Update the natural language program to reflect the observed object manipulations, relationships, and any conditional rules.

**Metrics and Observations per Example:**

I'll use a simplified representation here, describing observations; precise pixel counts can be derived as needed using `code_execution` in the next stage, if it comes to that:

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: A sequence of pixels: `[blue, red, green, yellow]`.
    *   Output: A checkerboard pattern of the input sequence. The given solution works fine here.
    *   Observation: initial program hypothesis is correct

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Two separate 2x1 "objects", a blue one, and an orange one.
    *   Output: Each object is replicated and spread into a 2x6, copying the color. They do not interact to create a checkerboard.
    *   Observation: initial solution fails. The transformation expands each object horizontally, filling the output grid, not mixing the input sequence.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Two single-pixel objects (green, magenta)
    *   Output: The single pixels expand into columns of their respective colors.
    *   Observation: The initial solution fails. The transformation expands each single-pixel object into a full-height column, maintaining color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - object1: {shape: 1x1, color: blue, position: (0,0)}
    - object2: {shape: 1x1, color: red, position: (0,1)}
    - object3: {shape: 1x1, color: green, position: (0,2)}
    - object4: {shape: 1x1, color: yellow, position: (0,3)}
  output_objects:
    - object1: {shape: 3x4, color_pattern: checkerboard, source: [object1, object2, object3, object4] }
  transformation: checkerboard_fill

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - object1: {shape: 2x1, color: blue, position: (0,0)}
    - object2: {shape: 2x1, color: orange, position: (0,1)}
  output_objects:
    - object1: {shape: 2x6, color: blue, source: object1}
    - object2: {shape: 2x6, color: orange, source: object2}
  transformation: horizontal_expansion

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - object1: {shape: 1x1, color: green, position: (0,0)}
    - object2: {shape: 1x1, color: magenta, position: (0,1)}
  output_objects:
     - object1: {shape: 3x1, color: green, source: object1 }
     - object2: {shape: 3x1, color: magenta, source: object2}
  transformation: vertical_expansion
```

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Expansion:**
    *   If an object is part of a horizontal sequence of different single-pixel colors at the top, expand it into a checkerboard using the sequence colors in the whole output grid (example 1).
    *   If the object is larger than a single pixel and the output has equal height, expand that color block to fill an area of same height and the object's portion of the output width (example 2).
    *    If an object consists of a single pixel and the output width equals the number of objects, expand each single pixel vertically into columns spanning the full height of the output grid (example 3).
3. Preserve color.
4. Maintain the relative horizontal positions of the objects

This refined natural language program provides more context-aware instructions, distinguishing between different object types and their corresponding transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
