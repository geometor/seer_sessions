example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: (1, 1)
      - color: red
        shape: (1, 1)
      - color: green
        shape: (1, 1)
    grid_shape: (1, 3)
  output:
    grid_shape: (3, 3)
    pattern: checkerboard
    colors: [blue, red, green]
  transformation: checkerboard expansion

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: (3, 3)
    grid_shape: (3, 3)
  output:
    grid_shape: (3, 6)
  transformation: horizontal expansion by factor of output width / input width

example_3:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: (1, 1)
      - color: red
        shape: (1, 1)
      - color: green
        shape: (1, 1)
    grid_shape: (3, 1)
  output:
    grid_shape: (3, 3)
  transformation: vertical and horizontal expansion filling output grid

example_4:
  input:
     objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: (1, 1)
      - color: gray
        shape: (1, 1)
      - color: red
        shape: (1, 1)
     grid_shape: (3,3)
  output:
    grid_shape: (3, 3)
  transformation: no change
