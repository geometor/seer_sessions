## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 8 3 0 0 0 0
8 3 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x777851443ED0>

**output:**
```
2 8 3 2 8 3 2
8 3 2 8 3 2 8
3 2 8 3 2 8 3
2 8 3 2 8 3 2
8 3 2 8 3 2 8
3 2 8 3 2 8 3
2 8 3 2 8 3 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a pattern of red, azure, and green pixels (represented by the numbers 2, 8, and 3, respectively) in the top-left corner, with the rest of the grid being white (0). The output grid appears to be a checkerboard-like expansion of this initial pattern. The white pixels seem to act as a background and are replaced by the alternating pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 7
      columns: 7
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 8] # white, red, green, azure
    initial_state: |
      2 8 3 0 0 0 0
      8 3 0 0 0 0 0
      3 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    final_state: |
      2 8 3 2 8 3 2
      8 3 2 8 3 2 8
      3 2 8 3 2 8 3
      2 8 3 2 8 3 2
      8 3 2 8 3 2 8
      3 2 8 3 2 8 3
      2 8 3 2 8 3 2

  - type: pattern
    properties:
      colors: [2, 8, 3]
      arrangement: checkerboard

actions:
    - type: expand
      description: The initial pattern in the top-left corner is expanded to fill the entire grid.
      mechanism:  The 3x3 subgrid containing the non-zero colors defines the repeating unit. The expansion replaces all '0' with the appropriate element of the repeating unit.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the core pattern:** Observe the top-left corner of the input grid where the non-zero colored pixels are located. In this case, it's a 3x3 region (although only 3x1 contains values) with red (2), azure (8), and green (3).

2.  **Checkerboard Expansion:**  This core pattern is expanded into a checkerboard pattern across the entire grid. Extend the 3x1 pattern by tiling. All zeros are replaced by the appropriate value to complete the repeating tile pattern.

In essence, the transformation replaces the white (0) pixels with the repeating 3x1 pattern of red, azure, and green to create the checkerboard effect.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
