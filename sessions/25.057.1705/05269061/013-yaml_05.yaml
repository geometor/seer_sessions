facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - height: 7
      - width: 7
      - values: integers 0-9 representing colors

  - object: input_grid
    parent: grid
    properties:
      - pattern: diagonal line of non-zero pixels from top-right to bottom-left.
      - non_zero_values: [8, 3, 4]

  - object: output_grid
    parent: grid
    properties:
      - pattern: Checkerboard, repeating input non-zero values.
      - non_zero_values: identical to input_grid, filling zero values.

  - observation: colors
    description: each number represents a different color.

  - observation: positions
    description: the original non-zero elements remain in the same general positions in output, in terms of sequence

  - observation: sequence
    description: the non-zero elements have been extended as a sequence, with values next to each other
