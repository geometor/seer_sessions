Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a misinterpretation of the pattern. It assumed a simple checkerboard pattern expanding from a 3x1 seed of red, azure, and green. However, the actual transformation is more complex and involves identifying specific shapes and replicating them with color changes, and possibly depends on position as well. The results show the initial code fails on all but the training example, but in some cases, it captures *part* of the pattern. We need to shift our focus from a simple checkerboard expansion to identifying the core repeating unit and how it is tiled/placed in the output.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to the shapes, colors, and their relative positions.
2.  **Identify the core unit:** Determine the smallest repeating unit in the output grid. This unit might not be a simple 3x1 pattern.
3.  **Determine the placement rule:** Figure out how the core unit is positioned and replicated across the output grid. This might involve mirroring, rotation, or other transformations.
4.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the identified core unit, its color variations, and the placement rule.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

```python

        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
        actual_output = np.array(actual_output)

        correct = np.array_equal(expected_output, actual_output)
        error_rate = 0
        if not correct:
          error_rate = np.sum(expected_output != actual_output) / expected_output.size
