The rest of the pixels are white (0).\n*   The output grid seems to contain the non-zero pixels from the input grid, rearranged.\n*\tThe colors of the non-zero pixels are preserved during transformation.\n*\tThe output grid contains 3 rows, and some rows could be empty.\n*   It appears the non-zero values are extracted and arranged into a smaller grid, possibly based on their original positions relative to each other, but it isn't simply cropping or translating a region of the original.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
