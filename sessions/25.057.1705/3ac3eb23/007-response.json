The transformation seems to involve creating a vertical, alternating pattern of yellow and white pixels, originating from the initial yellow pixel. The output grid has a repeating pattern of yellow and white, with yellow appearing every other row in the same column as the original yellow pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
