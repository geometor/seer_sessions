Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary object is a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The transformation seems to involve "detecting" this line and creating a patterned "cross" or "plus sign" around it, using azure (8) and the original orange (7). The background remains unchanged. The size and shape of the grid seem to be preserved.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: vertical_line
    color: orange (7)
    position: column 4 (index 3)
    length: 4
  - transformation: create_cross
    center_object: vertical_line
    horizontal_arm_color: azure (8)
    vertical_arm_color: orange (7)
    background: unchanged
  - grid:
      input_dimensions: 5x7
      output_dimensions: 5x7
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the vertical line:** Find the contiguous vertical line of orange (7) pixels. Note its vertical extent and horizontal position.
2.  **Construct the vertical arm:** Maintain the original orange (7) line in the output grid.
3.  **Construct the horizontal arms:** For each row containing part of the original vertical orange line, place an azure (8) pixel to the immediate left and right of the orange pixel.
4. **extend horizontal arms:** Extend the arm to the border, alternating the colors of the pixels
5.  **Preserve the background:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of the constructed cross should retain their original values in the output grid.
