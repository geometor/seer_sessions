The primary object is a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The transformation seems to involve \"detecting\" this line and creating a patterned \"cross\" or \"plus sign\" around it, using azure (8) and the original orange (7). The background remains unchanged. The size and shape of the grid seem to be preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
