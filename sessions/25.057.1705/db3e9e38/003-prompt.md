Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the vertical line:** Find the contiguous vertical line of orange (7) pixels. Note its vertical extent and horizontal position.
2.  **Construct the vertical arm:** Maintain the original orange (7) line in the output grid.
3.  **Construct the horizontal arms:** For each row containing part of the original vertical orange line, place an azure (8) pixel to the immediate left and right of the orange pixel.
4. **extend horizontal arms:** Extend the arm to the border, alternating the colors of the pixels
5.  **Preserve the background:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of the constructed cross should retain their original values in the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
