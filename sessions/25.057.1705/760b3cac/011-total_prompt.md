Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example, which involved extending an azure region to the right when a pair of azure pixels was followed by a white pixel. However, the results on the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is incorrect. The second and third examples suggest a different transformation: replacing white pixels with azure in the rows containing azure, effectively filling the entire row where azure exists with azure, and extending the azure to the edge, ignoring existing yellow pixels.

The strategy will be to:

1.  Analyze the results meticulously to confirm this new hypothesis.
2.  Express the updated transformation rule in clear, concise natural language.
3.  Create YAML block to capture the facts.

**Metrics and Observations**

Let's analyze the metrics reported by the code, example by example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Azure exists, some white pixels exist.
    *   Output: Azure region is extended by 1 to the right.
    *   Transformed (by the code): Matches the output.
    *   Success: True
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Azure and white pixels exist.
    *   Output: All pixels in the rows containing azure are turned azure.
    *   Transformed: Does not match. Only grows azure by one pixel to the right, next to existing azure pixels.
    *   Success: False
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Azure and white pixels exist.
    *    Output: All pixels in the rows containing azure are turned azure.
    *    Transformed: Does not match. Only grows azure by one pixel to the right, next to existing azure pixels.
    *    Success: False

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    input:
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: rectangle
          position: top
        - color: azure
          shape: rectangle
          position: bottom
        - color: white
          shape: line
          position: adjacent to azure
    output:
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: rectangle
          position: top
        - color: azure
          shape: rectangle
          position: bottom, expanded
    transformation: "Extend azure horizontally, one pixel to the right"

  - id: 2
    input:
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: rectangle
          position: top
        - color: azure
          shape: rectangle
          position: middle
        - color: white
          shape: line
          position: surrounding azure
    output:
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: rectangle
          position: top
        - color: azure
          shape: rectangle
          position: fills rows where azure exists
    transformation: "Fill all rows containing any azure pixels completely with azure."

  - id: 3
    input:
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: rectangle
          position: top
        - color: azure
          shape: line
          position: bottom
        - color: white
          shape: line
          position: left and right of azure
    output:
      objects:
          - color: yellow
            shape: rectangle
            position: top
          - color: azure
            shape: rectangle
            position: fills rows where azure exists
    transformation: "Fill all rows containing any azure pixels completely with azure."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check for Azure:** Determine if the row contains any azure (color code 8) pixels.
3.  **Fill with Azure:** If a row contains at least one azure pixel, change all pixels in that entire row to azure.
4.  **Preserve other rows:** rows that do not contain azure are left unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
