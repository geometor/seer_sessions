## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7778516D1450>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct shapes formed by the azure and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to involve some kind of manipulation of the azure shape, while the yellow shape remains unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: shape
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position:
      - [0, 3]
      - [1, 4]
      - [1, 5]
      - [2, 3]
    final_position:
      - [0, 2]
      - [0, 3]
      - [1, 0]
      - [1, 1]
      - [1, 4]
      - [1, 5]
      - [2, 2]
      - [2, 3]
  - type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position:
      - [3, 3]
      - [4, 3]
      - [4, 4]
      - [4, 5]
      - [5, 4]
    final_position:
      - [3, 3]
      - [4, 3]
      - [4, 4]
      - [4, 5]
      - [5, 4]
relationships:
  - type: unchanged
    objects: [yellow shape]
actions:
  - type: mirror_and_duplicate
    object: azure shape
    axis: vertical  # It's not a perfect mirror due to the shift
    notes: >
      The azure shape is mirrored, with added copies and the original shape disappearing.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the azure (8) and yellow (4) shapes within the grid.
2. **Yellow Shape:** Do not modify the yellow shape. Its output state is equal to input state.
3. **Azure Shape Transformation**:
   - Copy the azure shape, generating an reflection across a vertical axis on its left.
   - Add this to the existing shape
   - Remove the original azure shape.

In simple terms, copy shape 8 to its adjacent left and remove original shape 8. Shape 4 remains the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
