facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are contiguous regions of the same color.  Azure (8) and yellow (4) are key objects.
  - azure_object_property: |
       Azure objects define a set of columns, the columns including their pixels, for extension.
  - yellow_object_behavior: |
      Yellow (4) objects remain unchanged in position and shape between input and output.
  - azure_object_transformation: |
      Azure (8) objects are extended upwards within their original columns. The extension fills the space above the original azure pixels up to the top edge of the grid. The original azure object remains.
  - transformation_constraint:
      The extension only occurs in the columns defined by the original position of the Azure pixels of the objects.
