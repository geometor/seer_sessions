Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code (which is not provided but can be inferred from the test result) clearly doesn't capture the full transformation logic.  The single example provided shows a failure.  My strategy is to:

1.  **Visually inspect** each input/output pair to understand the transformation.
2.  **Develop a hypothesis** about the transformation rule in plain English.
3.  **Focus on object identification**: What are the distinct objects in the input and output grids?  How can we characterize them (color, shape, size, position)?
4.  **Focus on actions**: How are the input objects *transformed* into the output objects? Are they moved, resized, recolored, or is something else happening?
5.  **Iterative Refinement**:  I expect to go through several cycles of hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement.  The provided `result_grid` helps me understand the current code's behavior, highlighting the discrepancies with the expected `output_grid`.
6.  **Use `code_execution`**:  I'll use `code_execution` strategically. It's not for testing my final code (that will happen later), but for making precise measurements and observations about the grids *now*. I need accurate information about the sizes, positions, and colors of objects to inform my natural language program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I need to analyze the provided example, and will use `code_execution` to gather precise information.

```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

```output
Input Objects:

Output Objects:
[{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [(1, 0), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8)], 'min_row': 0, 'max_row': 9, 'min_col': 1, 'max_col': 2}, {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)], 'min_row': 0, 'max_row': 9, 'min_col': 3, 'max_col': 4}]
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: azure
    shape: rectangle
    size: 2x10
    position:
      top_left: [5, 0]
      bottom_right: [6, 9]

output_objects:
  - color: green
    shape: rectangle 
    size: variable
    position:
        description: "corners of the output grid excluding the first row"
  - color: azure
    shape: rectangle
    size: 2x10
    position:
        top_left: [3,0]
        bottom_right: [4,9]
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the azure rectangle**: In the input grid, locate the azure rectangle.
2.  **Move the azure rectangle up**:  Translate the entire azure rectangle upwards by two rows.
3.  **Create green corners:** Create four green pixels at the four corners of the output, excluding the first row. Specifically: row 1, col 0; row 1, col 9; row 2, col 1; and row 2, col 8.

This program seems to capture the essence of the transformation. It correctly describes the movement of the azure rectangle and the generation of the new green pixels in their specific locations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
