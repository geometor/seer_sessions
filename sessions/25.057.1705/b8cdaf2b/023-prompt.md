Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid same size of the input grid and filled with 0.
2.  **Iterate:** Examine the bottom two rows of the input grid.
3.  **Identify:** Locate yellow (4) pixels.
4.  **Check Adjacency**: For each yellow pixel, check if it has at least one red (2) neighbor (horizontally or vertically).
5. **Create:** if there is red neighbor, create new yellow pixel two rows above the location of the original yellow pixel.
6.  **Ignore:** If there is no red neighbor or if the location two rows above will be out of boundary, no yellow pixel will be created for the original yellow pixel.
7. **Output:** The modified grid will be the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
