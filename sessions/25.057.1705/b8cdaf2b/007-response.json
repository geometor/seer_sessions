The colors present are white (0), azure (8), and green (3). The input grid transforms into the output grid, with some changes in the pixel colors and their positions. The most notable changes are focused on the top three rows, seemingly added. It is very difficult to simply the task as there doesn't seem to be a clear relationship between the added rows to the input. The bottom two rows don't change, these are assumed to be the \"background\".\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
