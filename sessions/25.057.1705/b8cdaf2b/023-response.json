            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved creating new yellow pixels two rows above existing yellow pixels that had red neighbors. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. The provided feedback shows that the generated output did not match the expect output on several test examples. Specifically, testing against the provided data revealed errors in the conditions for creating yellow objects, which are related to the row selection logic. It's also clear that looking at the last two rows exclusively will not work for all cases, so that must be changed.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Expand Scope:** The code currently only considers the bottom two rows. We need to generalize this to consider all rows, or find a different rule for the row selection process.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Condition:** We need to carefully re-examine the relationship between yellow and red pixels. The adjacency rule might be more complex, it might involve diagonal neighbors, or potentially a different color altogether.\n3.  **Consider All Examples:** The updated natural language program must account for the transformations observed in *all* training examples, not just the first one.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution):**\nBecause I do not have code execution capabilities, I will make educated guesses, which would normally be done using code:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid, one yellow pixel at (2,1) with a red neighbor at (1,1).\n    *   Expected Output: Yellow pixel at (0,1).\n    *   Actual Output: Yellow pixel at (0,1).\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid. Contains a few clusters of yellow and red, each 2 x 2 and not touching.\n    *   Expected Output: Contains two yellow pixels in the top row in the center.\n    *   Actual Output: Contains no yellow pixels.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Yellow pixels were not generated because none of the red pixels are adjacent to the yellow.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 6x6 grid with yellow and red clusters.\n    *   Expected Output: Contains four yellow pixels in a line from column 1-4, in the third row (row index 2).\n    *   Actual Output: No Yellow Pixels\n    *   Result: Incorrect.\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: point\n        position: (2, 1)\n      - color: red\n        shape: point\n        position: (1, 1)\n    output_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: point\n        position: (0, 1)\n    transformation: \"Yellow pixel appears two rows above original if red is diagonally adjacent.\"\n  - example: 2\n    input_objects:\n        - shape: 2x2 square\n          color: yellow\n          position: multiple, non-adjacent\n        - shape: 2x2 square\n          color: red\n          position: multiple, non-adjacent\n    output_objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: point\n        position: two center columns, top row\n    transformation: \"Yellow pixels are created without obvious adjacency, top row, in center.\"\n  - example: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - shape: \"2x2 square\"\n        color: \"yellow\"\n        position: several, non-adjacent\n      - shape: \"2x2 square\"\n        color: \"red\"\n        position: several, non-adjacent\n    output_objects:\n      - shape: horizontal line\n        color: yellow\n        position: row 2, columns 1-4\n        length: 4\n    transformation: \"Yellow line segments extend based on input blocks.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros (representing white).\n2. **Iterate:** Iterate through *all* cells of the input grid.\n3. **Observe Yellow and Red Clusters:** For each cell in the input that is part of a yellow 2x2 square,\n    do not assume adjacency between the yellow and red 2 x 2 squares.\n4. **Determine New Yellow Position:** If a cell is part of 2x2 yellow square, place a yellow\npixel in the output.\n5. **Row positioning:** if the yellow 2x2 occupies rows 4 and 5 in the input, put a yellow\npixel on row 0 of the same column in the output.\n6. **Row positioning:** if the yellow 2x2 occupies rows 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 0\n   and 1 in the input, put a yellow pixel on row 2 of the same column in the output.\n\n7.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.\n"
