Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Background:** Locate the bottom two rows of the input grid. These will remain unchanged.
2.  **Maintain Background:** Copy the identified two bottom rows directly to the output grid.
3.  **Construct rows to insert:**
    *   The first inserted row will be all 0.
    *   The second inserted row will be green (3) at opposite ends of the row, filling the remaining spaces with white (0).
    *   The third inserted row is the same at the second inserted row except the green elements (3) are adjacent to the end, filling the remaining spaces with white (0)
4.  **Combine:** insert the constructed rows at the top of the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
