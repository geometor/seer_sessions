observations:
  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: point
        position: (2, 1)
      - color: red
        shape: point
        position: (1, 1)
    output_objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: point
        position: (0, 1)
    transformation: "Yellow pixel appears two rows above original if red is diagonally adjacent."
  - example: 2
    input_objects:
        - shape: 2x2 square
          color: yellow
          position: multiple, non-adjacent
        - shape: 2x2 square
          color: red
          position: multiple, non-adjacent
    output_objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: point
        position: two center columns, top row
    transformation: "Yellow pixels are created without obvious adjacency, top row, in center."
  - example: 3
    input_objects:
      - shape: "2x2 square"
        color: "yellow"
        position: several, non-adjacent
      - shape: "2x2 square"
        color: "red"
        position: several, non-adjacent
    output_objects:
      - shape: horizontal line
        color: yellow
        position: row 2, columns 1-4
        length: 4
    transformation: "Yellow line segments extend based on input blocks."
