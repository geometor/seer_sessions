The input grid seems to have some pixels with specific colors (red, magenta, and white), while the output grid introduces a new color (blue) and modifies some of the existing pixels. The positions of the magenta pixel remain unchanged. The red pixels also seem to maintain relative postion.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
