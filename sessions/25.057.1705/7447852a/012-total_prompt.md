Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Adjacency Check (Left/Right):** For each red pixel, check if it has a horizontally adjacent white pixel (value 0).

    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel to its right, change the white box to its right to yellow.
    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel to its left, change the white box to its left to yellow.

3.  **Vertical Adjacency Check (Above/Below** For each red pixel, check if it has a vertically adjacent white pixel (value 0)

    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel above it, change the white box above it to yellow
    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel below it, change the white box below it to yellow.

4. **Diagonal Adjacency Check:** If there are white pixels diagonal to any red pixel do NOT change it to yellow.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels that are not horizontally or vertically adjacent to a red pixel remain unchanged.
6.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output, containing red, white, and yellow pixels based on the adjacency rule.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: turning white pixels yellow if they are adjacent to red pixels. However, the initial program was too broad, encompassing *all* adjacent white pixels (horizontally and vertically). The additional examples reveal a crucial constraint: only the white pixels to the *right* of the red pixels are changed to yellow. The provided code already contains this constraint because it iterates through the grid starting on the left.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

The primary error is conceptual: the code is almost correct but the logic is slightly off. It changes adjacent white pixels in all direct (not diagonal) directions rather than in the single required direction (right). The updated natural language program will focus on clarifying this critical distinction to get the logic of the solution.

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**

To be absolutely certain about the nature of each of the training set, I will construct a small reporting utility to give clear insight into the data.

```python
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    """Provides a descriptive summary of the grid."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    description = {
        "dimensions": f"{rows}x{cols}",
        "colors": color_counts
    }
    return description

def analyze_examples(examples):
   report = ""
   for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)  # use the provided transform
        correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid)
        
        report += f"Example {i+1}:\n"
        report += f"  Input: {describe_grid(input_grid)}\n"
        report += f"  Output: {describe_grid(output_grid)}\n"
        report += f"  Transformed: {describe_grid(transformed_grid)}\n"
        report += f"  Correct: {correct}\n"
        report += "\n"
   return report

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
