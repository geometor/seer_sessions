The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve some kind of interaction or replacement of colors based on their adjacency. The input grid has a discernible pattern, and it seems that the yellow color is introduced in the output grid based on the context defined in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If a white pixel is horizontally adjacent to a red pixel *on the left*, then change that white pixel to a yellow one.\n5.  If a white pixel is horizontally adjacent to a red pixel *on the right*, then change that white pixel to a yellow one.\n6. If a white pixel has *red neighbours on both its left and right*, and a yellow pixel is on the edge of the block of the size three whites that contain that white pixel, and on the *same* side as the neighbor red, substitute this white with a yellow.\n7.  Copy all red pixels from the input to the output grid, in their original positions, without changing their color.\n\nEssentially, white pixels touching red pixels horizontally can become yellow.\n"
