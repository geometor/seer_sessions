## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7778516D1950>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0
4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2
4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to involve the introduction of the number '4' (yellow) in specific locations relative to the number '2' (red).  There's a spatial relationship between the '2's and the introduced '4's. It seems we're modifying or adding to the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x10 (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    relations:
      - input_to_output: transformation

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - location: row and column index within the grid

  - action: modification
    description: changing pixel color from 0 to 4
    conditions:
      - spatial_relation: proximity to pixels of color 2

  - observation:
      - pattern:  '4's appear in locations where '0's were adjacent to '2's, seemingly expanding outwards.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify '2's:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value '2' (red).

2. **Locate Targets:** Find all '0' (white) pixels directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to the '2's.

3. **Conditional Modification:** There was at least one instance of a '0' adjacent to more than one 2. If this happens, fill with yellow (value 4).

4.  **Fill:** Transform each located '0' adjacent to a `2` pixel into a '4' (yellow).

5.  **Preserve**: All other pixel locations in the input keep their value in the output.

6.  **Output**: The result is the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
