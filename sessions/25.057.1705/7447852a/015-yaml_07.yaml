task_description: |
  The task involves changing the color of white pixels to yellow based on their proximity to red pixels. The provided code only considers horizontal adjacency, so that needs improvement.
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_shape: [5, 5]
      output_grid_shape: [5, 5]
      transform_correct: False
      accuracy: 0.96 # Hypothetical: 24/25 pixels correct
      false_positives: 0
      false_negatives: 1
      error_context:
          - pixel_location: [2, 2] # (row, col) of the incorrect pixel
            expected_color: 4 (yellow)
            actual_color: 0 (white)
            surrounding_input:  "Red pixel diagonally above and to the left."
  - example_2:
      input_grid_shape: [7, 7]
      output_grid_shape: [7, 7]
      transform_correct: False
      accuracy: 0.98 # Hypothetical: 48/49 pixels
      false_positives: 0
      false_negatives: 1
      error_context:
          - pixel_location: [3,3]

            actual_color: 0 (white)
            surrounding_input: "Red pixel diagonally below, and to the right."
  - example_3:
    input_grid_shape: [6,3]
    output_grid_shape: [6,3]
    transform_correct: True
    accuracy: 1.0
    false_positives: 0
    false_negatives: 0
