Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Adjacency Check (Left/Right):** For each red pixel, check if it has a horizontally adjacent white pixel (value 0).

    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel to its right, change the white box to its right to yellow.
    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel to its left, change the white box to its left to yellow.

3.  **Vertical Adjacency Check (Above/Below** For each red pixel, check if it has a vertically adjacent white pixel (value 0)

    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel above it, change the white box above it to yellow
    *   If there is a white pixel adjacent to the red pixel below it, change the white box below it to yellow.

4. **Diagonal Adjacency Check:** If there are white pixels diagonal to any red pixel do NOT change it to yellow.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels that are not horizontally or vertically adjacent to a red pixel remain unchanged.
6.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output, containing red, white, and yellow pixels based on the adjacency rule.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
