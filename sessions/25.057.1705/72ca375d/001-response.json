The input grid contains multiple colored regions (represented by non-zero digits). The output grid seems to be a cropped and possibly filtered portion of the input grid. Specifically, it appears to focus on a single color (magenta, represented by the digit 6) from the input. The white (0) seems to act like a background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
