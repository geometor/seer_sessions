## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7778516019F0>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x777851601D10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program description.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input is a small 4x4 grid. The output is a larger 8x8 grid.
*   The input grid contains a single red (2) pixel; the rest are white (0).
*   The output grid contains two red (2) pixels at positions that maintain relative location of input red pixel.
*   The output grid has many azure (8) pixels, in alternating positions
*   The output contains white (0) pixels

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    size: 4x4
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
        count: 1
      - color: white
        value: 0
        count: 15
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    size: 8x8
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
        count: 2
      - color: white
        value: 0
        count: 32
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        count: 30
  - action: replication
    description: The red pixel from the input grid is replicated in a specific pattern in output grid.
  - action: expansion:
      description: Input grid doubles in height and width
  - action: insertion
    description: Azure pixels are inserted in a checkerboard pattern.
  - relationship: spatial
    description: The position of the red pixels seems maintains consistency relative to the initial input red pixel and other added elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (from 4x4 to 8x8).

2.  **Replicate Red:** Duplicate input red pixel
    *   first replicated pixel will appear at same row but in column = column * 2
    *   second replicated pixel will appear at row = row * 4, column will stay
        the same

3.  **Populate Azure Checkboard:** Fill alternating cells in the expanded output grid with azure (8), starting at the top-left cell (0,0). Specifically add an azure cell to the output grid if:
    *   the sum of its row and column indices is even.

4. **Fill Remaining with White**: Any output cells not filled with a value are filled with white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
