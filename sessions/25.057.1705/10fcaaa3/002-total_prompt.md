## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x777851601DB0>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x256 at 0x7778515B6170>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid. The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. The output grid seems to be an expansion and modification of the input grid, with the introduction of new values/colors and a repeating pattern. The most notable changes are the duplication of the gray (5) cells, and the introduction of azure (8) cells in specific positions.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x4
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - notable_value: 5 (gray)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x8
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - notable_values:
        - 5 (gray)
        - 8 (azure)
  - transformation:
    type: expansion and modification
    steps:
      - duplicate_input_rows: input rows are duplicated vertically.
      - duplicate_input_columns_with_gray: the column containing gray (5) in the original input is duplicated, while other columns are only expanded by adding 0 on either side.
      - add_azure_rows: Rows of alternating azure (8) and white (0) are added above and below the duplicated input.
      - repeating_pattern: The output grid maintains a 2x2 pattern relative to the original input pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate Input Rows:** The input grid's rows are duplicated to create an intermediate grid that is twice the height of the input.
2.  **Expand and Duplicate Columns based on Gray:**
    *   Locate the column in the original input containing gray (5) pixels.
    *   Duplicate columns in the intermediate grid. The columns containing gray cells are duplicated to the left and right, maintaining the gray cells in the copied column. All the other columns just have 0 added to the right and left.
3.  **Add Azure Rows:** Add a row above and a row below the current intermediate grid. These rows consist of alternating azure (8) and white (0) pixels, starting with azure.

In essence, the transformation expands the input grid, duplicates specific elements, adds new elements based on the duplication, and creates a larger, patterned output. The presence of gray (5) in the input seems to be a trigger for the specific column duplication rule.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
