Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (e.g., 4x4 to 8x8).

2.  **Replicate Red:** Duplicate the input red pixel in the output grid.
    *   The output red pixel will always appear on the same row index, but
        multiplied by two, mod the new width. If the new width is 8, and
        the original row,col is [2,1], then the new position will be [2,2],
        while if the original was [0,0], the new will be [0,5]

3.  **Populate Azure Checkerboard:** Fill alternating cells in the expanded
    output grid with azure (8), starting at the top-left cell (0,0).
    Specifically add an azure cell to the output grid if: the sum of its row
    and column indices is even.

4. **Fill Remaining with White**: Any output cells not filled with a value
   are filled with white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
