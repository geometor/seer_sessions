Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves the following steps:
1. Expand the input grid by doubling its dimensions (both height and width).
2. Replicate the magenta pixels ('6') from the input grid in the output grid based on a specific pattern.
    - Each '6' in the input corresponds to a 2x2 section in the output.
    -  Within its 2x2 section, each '6' is placed in a specific, repeating pattern.
3. Fill the remaining cells with azure ('8') in a checkerboard and solid line pattern. The 8's fill the 2x2 section for the doubled pixel locations as well as perimeter lines.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
