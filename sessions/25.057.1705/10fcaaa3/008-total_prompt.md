## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 6 0
0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x777851601DB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 6 0 0 0 6 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 6 0 8 0 6 0 8
8 0 6 0 8 0 6 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7778515B6170>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x4 grid. Some cells contain the digit '0' (white), while others contain the digit '6' (magenta).
*   **Output:** A 6x8 grid. It seems to be an expansion of the original grid. It contains '0' (white), '6' (magenta), and a new color '8'(azure). The '6's appear in positions related to the input, but with an added alternating pattern. The '8' forms a kind of checkerboard or fill pattern within the expansion, and solid lines around the perimeter and between sections.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x4
    elements: [0, 6]
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x8
    elements: [0, 6, 8]
  - id: magenta_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    value: 6
    input_location: [(0, 2), (2, 1)]
  - id: azure_pixels
      type: pixel group
      value: 8
      output_location: checkerboard and solid lines

actions:
  - type: expand
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    factors: [2, 2] #doubles in both dimensions
  - type: replicate_with_offset
    input: magenta_pixels
    pattern: alternating, checkerboard like
  - type: fill
    value: 8
    rule: checkerboard pattern and solid fill lines

relationships:
   - output_grid is an expanded version of input_grid
   - magenta pixels are replicated and offset
   - '8' fills the space using the alternating and solid fill pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand:** The input grid is doubled in both dimensions (height and width).

2.  **Replicate and Offset '6':** The magenta pixels ('6') from the input grid are replicated in the output grid. Their placement follows a pattern:
    *   Each original '6' occupies a 2x2 section of the expanded grid.
    *   Within the 2x2 sections they have a specific placement relating to the overall checkerboard.
    *   For each original '6' location in the input:
        *   It appears in the top-left cell of its 2x2 section.
        *   It appears in the cell diagonally adjacent (down and right) within its section.

3.  **Checkerboard and solid lines Fill with '8':** The remaining empty cells in the expanded grid, are filled with azure pixels ('8') in an alternating checkerboard pattern *and* form a solid azure line around the perimeter and between sections, as though the 2x2 sections that represent a doubled pixel are highlighted. The '8's are in locations within their 2x2 area.

In summary, the transformation involves expanding the grid, replicating and positioning the original magenta pixels within a larger pattern, and filling the background with a checkerboard and solid line pattern of azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
