Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Duplicate Input Rows:** The input grid's rows are duplicated to create an intermediate grid that is twice the height of the input.
2. **Expand and Duplicate Columns based on Gray:**
   - Locate the column in the original input containing gray (5) pixels.
   - Duplicate columns in the intermediate grid. The columns containing gray cells are duplicated to the left and right, maintaining the gray cells in the copied column. All the other columns just have 0 added to the right and left.
3. **Add Azure Rows:** Add a row above and a row below the current intermediate grid. These rows consist of alternating azure (8) and white (0) pixels, starting with azure.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
