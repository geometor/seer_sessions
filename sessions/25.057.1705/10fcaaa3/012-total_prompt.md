Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves the following steps:
1. Expand the input grid by doubling its dimensions (both height and width).
2. Replicate the magenta pixels ('6') from the input grid in the output grid based on a specific pattern.
    - Each '6' in the input corresponds to a 2x2 section in the output.
    -  Within its 2x2 section, each '6' is placed in a specific, repeating pattern.
3. Fill the remaining cells with azure ('8') in a checkerboard and solid line pattern. The 8's fill the 2x2 section for the doubled pixel locations as well as perimeter lines.

    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the results and an updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a partially correct understanding of the transformation. It correctly identified the doubling of the grid size and the placement of some magenta (6) pixels. However, it incorrectly handled the placement of the azure (8) pixels and made assumptions not consistent across all examples. The core issue is a misunderstanding of the placement rule for '8' and partially for the '6's. The current logic places '8's based on modulo of *output grid* coordinates. Instead, the placement rule is related to the positions of the '6's in the *input* grid, and a consistent "background" pattern.

**Strategy:**

1. **Refine '6' placement:** Re-examine how '6's in the input relate to the output. The current implementation places a single '6' for each input '6', at the "top-left" location. We need to verify if it is, indeed, only the top-left, or a different pattern within the 2x2 output block. The current program shows incorrect placement of 6s in the second pair and incorrect placement of the 0s.
2. **Correct '8' placement:**  The '8' placement is incorrectly modeled as a simple checkerboard. A new hypothesis must be developed by looking at the relative placement with the original location of the '6's in the *input* grid.
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Test and correct based on *all* training examples, not just the first. The results of Pair 1 are misleading when considered alone.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for accuracy):**

```python

        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output, expected_output)

Key Observations:

- **Pair 1:**  Incorrect '8' placement. The final row and some cells within the output.
- **Pair 2:** Incorrect dimensions and values - the width dimension differs and many incorrect values.
- **Pair 3**: Incorrect dimensions - height is different.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create the output grid.
2. **Magenta Placement (Top-Left Rule):** For each magenta pixel (value '6') in the input grid, place a magenta pixel in the top-left corner of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid. Specifically, if a magenta pixel is at `(r, c)` in the input, place a magenta pixel at `(2r, 2c)` in the output.
3. **Azure Border:** If an input grid row contains one or more '6' pixels, draw a solid line of '8' pixels across the *entire* corresponding *expanded* output rows. For each row `r` in input, rows `2r` and `2r+1` in output, should have '8' values if row `r` contains a 6.
4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all remaining empty cells (not occupied by '6' or '8') in the output grid with black pixels ('0').

This revised program clarifies the placement rules, especially for the azure pixels, and connects them more directly to the input grid's structure. It also introduces the crucial "top-left" rule for magenta pixel replication, which was missing before. This will be very important information to have in the Coder role.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
