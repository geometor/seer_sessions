  - description: "For each identified colored pixel, create a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid."
    details:
       - example_1: "Pixel (0,0) color 8 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,0), pixel (0,3) color 8 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,2), pixel (3,0) color 8 becomes a 2x2 block at (2,0), and Pixel (3,3) color 3 becomes 2x2 at (2,2)"
       - example_2: "Pixel (0,0) color 6 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,0), pixel (0,5) color 2 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,4), pixel (5,0) color 4 becomes a 2x2 at (2,0), Pixel (5,5) color 7 becomes 2x2 at (2,4).  All 1's are unchanged."
       - example_3: "Pixel (0,0) color 7 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,0), pixel (7,7) color 5 becomes a 2x2 block at (6,6)"
       - test_1: "Pixel (0,0) color 2 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,0), pixel (0,5) color 4 becomes a 2x2 block at (0,4), pixel (5,0) color 3 becomes a 2x2 at (2,0), Pixel (5,5) color 1 becomes 2x2 at (2,4)"

  - description: "Pixels with color 1 and color 5, and color 0 are treated differently."
    details:
        - observation: "Color 1 pixels in the second example show no change - it appears they remain unchanged."
        - observation: "Color 0 (background) in the input grid remain unchanged"
        - observation:  "Color 5 appears to act like a colored pixel."
