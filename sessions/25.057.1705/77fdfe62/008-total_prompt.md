## Example 2

**input:**
```
9 1 0 0 1 4
1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 8 8 1 0
0 1 8 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1
2 1 0 0 1 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7778514422B0>

**output:**
```
9 4
2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x777851443930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x6 grid of colored pixels, and the output is a 2x2 grid of colored pixels. The colors in the output grid appear to be a subset of the colors present in the input grid. It seems that only the corner colors and values are used to generate the smaller output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: [6, 6]
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varied (0-9, representing different colors)
      - value: integer (0-9)

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: [2, 2]
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varied (subset of input_grid colors)
      - value: integer (subset of input_grid values)

actions:
  - type: extract
    agent: system
    target: input_grid corners
    result: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid:contains: output_grid (colors and values)
  - output_grid:is_a_subset_of: input_grid (corner elements)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corners:** Locate the four corner pixels of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Values:** Extract the integer values of these four corner pixels.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
4.  **Populate Output:** Place the values from the input grid corners into the corresponding corners of the output grid. Top-left input corner goes to top-left output corner, top-right to top-right, bottom-left to bottom-left, and bottom-right to bottom-right.

In essence, the transformation extracts the values from the four corners of the input grid and creates a new 2x2 grid using those values, maintaining their relative positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
