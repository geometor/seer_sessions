    - example_3:
       - objects:
            - blue_border:
                shape: rectangle, surrounding
                color: blue (1)
                action: removed
            - white_background:
                color: white (0)
                action: removed
            - inner_figure:
                colors: [grey(5), yellow(4)]
                action: condensed, relative positions maintained
            - output_grid:
              size: 3x3
       - transformation: "Remove the blue border and white background. Extract and condense the inner figure (gray and yellow pixels) while maintaining their relative positions within the figure."

- general_rule: "The transformation removes a surrounding blue border and white background pixels. The remaining pixels, which form a distinct inner figure, are condensed into a smaller grid. The relative positions of the pixels within the inner figure are preserved during the condensation."
