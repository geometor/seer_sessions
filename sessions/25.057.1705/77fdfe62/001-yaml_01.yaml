facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - description: Contains a border of blue (1) pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - description: Contains a subset of pixels from the input_grid, excluding blue(1) and mostly white(0) pixels, maintaining relative position.
  - action: extraction
    description: Non-blue and non-white pixels are extracted from the input_grid.
  - action: condensation
    description: Extracted pixels are arranged in a smaller grid, preserving the relative postion, row by row, from top-left.
  - relationship: input_output_correspondence
    description:  The output_grid represents a condensed version of the salient features (non-blue/non-white colors) of the input_grid.
