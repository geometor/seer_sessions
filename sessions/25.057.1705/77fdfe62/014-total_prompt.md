## Example 3

**input:**
```
6 1 0 0 0 0 1 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 8 0 8 1 0
0 1 8 8 8 0 1 0
0 1 8 0 8 8 1 0
0 1 8 8 8 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
7 1 0 0 0 0 1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7778514422B0>

**output:**
```
0 6 0 2
6 6 2 0
7 0 4 4
7 7 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x777851443930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to contain several distinct objects and features:

*   A large blue (1) rectangle filling most of the grid.
*   A central "cross" or "plus" shape of azure (8) pixels.
*   Four single-pixel objects in the corners: magenta (6), red (2), orange (7), and yellow (4).
*   Background is white (0)

The output grid seems to derive by:

*    A 2x2 block for each single-pixel object.
*    Colors from the corner objects in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - description: "Input grid dimensions"
    value: 8x8
  - description: "Output grid dimensions"
    value: 4x4
  - description: "Input corner objects"
    value:
      - color: magenta (6)
        location: top-left
      - color: red (2)
        location: top-right
      - color: orange (7)
        location: bottom-left
      - color: yellow (4)
        location: bottom-right
  - description: "Output quadrants"
    value:
      - top-left: "Two magenta (6) pixels, one white above and to right"
      - top-right: "Two red(2), one white to left and bottom"
      - bottom-left: "Two orange(7), one white above and to right"
      - bottom-right: "Two yellow(4), one white to left and above"
  - description: "central shape in input"
    value: "azure (8) cross"
    attribute: "ignored in output"
  - description: "blue rectange"
    value: "blue rectangle object surronding the azure cross"
    attribute: "ignored in output"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corner Colors:** Locate the single-pixel objects in the four corners of the input grid. Note their colors: magenta (top-left), red (top-right), orange (bottom-left), and yellow (bottom-right).

2.  **Create Output Quadrants:** Divide the output grid into four 2x2 quadrants.

3.  **Fill Quadrants:**
    *   Top-left quadrant: Fill the top-left pixel with the color of the top-left corner pixel from the input (magenta). Fill the bottom-left and top-right with the color of the top-left corner pixel. Fill bottom-right with background (white)
    *   Top-right quadrant: Fill the top-right pixel with the color of the top-right corner pixel from the input (red). Fill the top-left and bottom-right with the color of the top-right corner pixel. Fill bottom-left with background (white).
    *   Bottom-left quadrant: Fill the bottom-left pixel with the color of the bottom-left corner pixel from the input (orange). Fill the top-left and bottom-right with color of the bottom-left corner pixel. Fill the top-right with the background (white).
    *   Bottom-right quadrant: Fill the bottom-right pixel with the color of the bottom-right corner pixel from the input (yellow). Fill bottom-left and top-right with the color of the bottom-right corner. Fill the top-left with background (white).

4.  Ignore all other objects inside the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
