```python
"""
The transformation rule extracts the colors from the four corner pixels of the input grid and uses them to fill corresponding 2x2 quadrants in the output grid. The output grid is half the size of the input grid in each dimension. Each quadrant in the output is filled with three pixels matching the color from its input corner, with one background pixel in the opposite corner.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
