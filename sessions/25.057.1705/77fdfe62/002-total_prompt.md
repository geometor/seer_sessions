## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 0 0 0 0 1 3
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 8 0 0 1 0
0 1 8 8 0 8 1 0
0 1 0 0 8 0 1 0
0 1 8 0 8 8 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
4 1 0 0 0 0 1 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7778514422B0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0 0
2 2 0 3
0 0 6 0
4 0 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x777851443930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid seems to contain various colored pixels, with a notable presence of blue (1) pixels forming a "border" or "frame". The output grid appears to extract specific, non-blue/non-white pixels from the input, preserving their color, and arranging them in a condensed form. The blue frame is removed, and it seems like relative positions of the colors in the input grid are kind of conserved in the output grid, starting from top-left, going row by row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - description: Contains a border of blue (1) pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - description: Contains a subset of pixels from the input_grid, excluding blue(1) and mostly white(0) pixels, maintaining relative position.
  - action: extraction
    description: Non-blue and non-white pixels are extracted from the input_grid.
  - action: condensation
    description: Extracted pixels are arranged in a smaller grid, preserving the relative postion, row by row, from top-left.
  - relationship: input_output_correspondence
    description:  The output_grid represents a condensed version of the salient features (non-blue/non-white colors) of the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Border:** Recognize the outer "frame" of blue (value 1) pixels surrounding the input grid.
2.  **Exclude Border and Whites:** Ignore all blue (1) and most white (0) pixels. Consider white pixels as background, and keep some to maintain structure.
3.  **Extract Salient Pixels:** Traverse the input grid, extracting cells those are not blue(1) nor part of the contiguous white regions.
4.  **Condense into Output:** Create a new, smaller grid. Place the extracted pixels into this new grid, maintaining their relative positions from the input grid order. Iterate row by row and from top-left of input grid.
5. **Maintain relative position**: Output grid size is smaller than input grid, so there will be wrapping around when filling.

Essentially, the program removes the blue border and white background and condenses the remaining colored pixels into a smaller grid, preserving their relative arrangement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
