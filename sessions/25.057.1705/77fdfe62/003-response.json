            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved removing a blue border and condensing the remaining non-white pixels. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The code fails in some cases because it doesn't correctly identify and preserve the spatial relationships between the non-white and non-blue pixels. It also makes assumptions about the output grid size (4x4) that are not universally true. The core issue is that the code is extracting salient pixels but not maintaining all information needed to map them to their final output grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Revisit the White Region Logic:** The current `_is_part_of_white_region` function is too simplistic. We need a more robust way to distinguish between \"background\" white pixels and white pixels that are part of the core object(s).\n2.  **Preserve Relative Positions:** Instead of just collecting salient pixels, we need to consider their original positions *relative to each other*. This suggests we might need to calculate offsets or relative coordinates.\n3. **Determine output grid:** Instead of hardcoding the output size, infer the size and arrangement of the output grid dynamically, if possible.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will use the training examples to incrementally refine the transformation logic, testing the code after each modification.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations and calculated properties using code execution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)\n\n    input_non_blue_non_white = []\n    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape\n    for r in range(input_rows):\n        for c in range(input_cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 1 and input_grid[r,c] != 0:\n                input_non_blue_non_white.append((r, c, input_grid[r,c]))\n\n    output_non_blue_non_white = []\n    output_rows, output_cols = output_grid.shape\n    for r in range(output_rows):\n        for c in range(output_cols):\n            if output_grid[r, c] != 1 and output_grid[r,c] != 0:\n              output_non_blue_non_white.append((r, c, output_grid[r,c]))\n\n    print(f\"  Input grid size: {input_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Output grid size: {output_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Input Non-blue/white pixels: {input_non_blue_non_white}\")\n    print(f\"  Output Non-blue/white pixels: {output_non_blue_non_white}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    return input_non_blue_non_white, output_non_blue_non_white\n\nexamples = [\n    (\n        [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        [[3, 2], [2, 3]]\n    ),\n     (\n        [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7, 8, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]],\n        [[7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7]]\n    ),\n    (\n       [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 4, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        [[5, 5, 5], [5, 4, 5], [5, 5, 5]]\n    )\n\n]\n\nfor i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(examples):\n    print(f\"Example {i + 1}:\")\n    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\n- task_id: \"Task XYZ\" # Replace with the actual task ID\n- observations:\n    - example_1:\n        - objects:\n            - blue_border:\n                shape: rectangle\n                color: blue (1)\n                action: removed\n            - white_background:\n                color: white (0)\n                action: removed\n            - inner_figure:\n                shape: rectangle\n                colors: [red(2), green(3)]\n                action: condensed and preserved\n                relative_position: preserved after removal of border/background\n            - output_grid:\n                size: 2x2\n                arrangement: rows and columns switched, top-left remains top-left\n        - transformation: \"Remove blue border and white background.

Place the pixels of the inner figure into the output grid, preserving their relative positions and colors, as if the surrounding blue and white pixels had simply been removed and the figure \"collapsed\" inwards.\n\n"
