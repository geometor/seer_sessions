The input grid seems to contain various colored pixels, with a notable presence of blue (1) pixels forming a \"border\" or \"frame\". The output grid appears to extract specific, non-blue/non-white pixels from the input, preserving their color, and arranging them in a condensed form. The blue frame is removed, and it seems like relative positions of the colors in the input grid are kind of conserved in the output grid, starting from top-left, going row by row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider white pixels as background, and keep some to maintain structure.\n3.  **Extract Salient Pixels:** Traverse the input grid, extracting cells those are not blue(1) nor part of the contiguous white regions.\n4.  **Condense into Output:** Create a new, smaller grid. Place the extracted pixels into this new grid, maintaining their relative positions from the input grid order. Iterate row by row and from top-left of input grid.\n5. **Maintain relative position**: Output grid size is smaller than input grid, so there will be wrapping around when filling.\n\nEssentially, the program removes the blue border and white background and condenses the remaining colored pixels into a smaller grid, preserving their relative arrangement.\n"
