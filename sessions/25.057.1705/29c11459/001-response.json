The input grid contains a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2) on the second row, with all other pixels being white (0). The output grid maintains the same structure, but the blue and red pixels have expanded. A gray pixel (5) appears between the expanded blue and red regions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
