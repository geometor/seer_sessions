## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 5 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7778516D1950>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7778516D14F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (blue, represented by '1') and its arrangement, possibly disregarding other colors present in the input. The output grid is significantly smaller, suggesting a process of extraction, summarization, or pattern recognition. The grey pixel in input doesn't exist in the output, this may be relevant.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 10x10 grid of pixels.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid of pixels.
  - observation: Input contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
  - observation: Output contains pixels of colors white (0) and blue (1).
  - object: Blue_region_1
    type: Contiguous region
    color: Blue (1)
    description: A region of blue pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - shape: Irregular, but bounded.
      - location: Spans multiple rows and columns.
  - relation: Output appears to be a condensed representation of Blue_region_1.
  - action: Extraction of blue region.
    input: Full input grid.
    output: Smaller grid containing only the extracted blue region, and white pixels.
  - action: Resizing/Cropping.
    input: Extracted blue shape
    output: smallest possible square shape that can contain all the blue.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the contiguous region of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Isolate Boundary:** find minimum and maximum row and col of blue (1) pixels.
3. **Extract Subgrid**: construct an output using a subgrid of the original, bounded by the discovered rows and cols.
4. **Fill Output**: any pixel that was a 1 in the input grid is a 1 in the output grid, and all others are 0.

In essence, the transformation isolates and extracts the smallest bounding box that will surround the blue colored pixels, into a smaller grid, filling in the rest with white pixels (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
