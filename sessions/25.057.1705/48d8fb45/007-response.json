The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and yellow (4), with a single instance of gray (5) in the input, which disappears in the output. The yellow pixels appear to form a discontinuous shape in the input, and the output seems to extract a subset of these yellow pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
