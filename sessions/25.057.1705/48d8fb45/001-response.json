The input grid appears to contain various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (blue, represented by '1') and its arrangement, possibly disregarding other colors present in the input. The output grid is significantly smaller, suggesting a process of extraction, summarization, or pattern recognition. The grey pixel in input doesn't exist in the output, this may be relevant.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
