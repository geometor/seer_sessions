            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided data and the results of the `describe_grid` function to understand the transformation and formulate a natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe `describe_grid` function correctly identifies objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) and their properties (bounding box, height, width, pixel count, and color). However, it describes the grids, but it does not implement the transformation. The core task is to find the relationship between the input and output grids, focusing on the *change* in objects.  The provided examples clearly show a significant reduction in size and a focus on blue (color 1) objects. The output grids consist only of the blue objects and, crucially, they are reshaped/resized.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Change:** Instead of just describing input and output separately, we need to compare them. Specifically, we're looking for what aspects of the input grid are *preserved* in the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Key Objects:** The consistent presence of blue (color 1) objects suggests they are the key to the transformation.\n3.  **Bounding Box Relationship:**  The output grid's dimensions seem directly related to the bounding box of the blue object in the input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: '3bdb4ada'\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 0\n    input:\n      object_count: 2\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 7\n          max_row: 10\n          min_col: 14\n          max_col: 17\n        height: 4\n        width: 4\n    output:\n      object_count: 1\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 0\n          max_row: 3\n          min_col: 0\n          max_col: 3\n        height: 4\n        width: 4\n    transformation:\n      type: \"extract_and_resize\"\n      preserved_color: 1\n      notes: \"Output grid is the bounding box of the blue object in the input.\"\n\n  - example_id: 1\n    input:\n      object_count: 2\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 7\n          max_row: 9\n          min_col: 14\n          max_col: 16\n        height: 3\n        width: 3\n    output:\n      object_count: 1\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 0\n          max_row: 2\n          min_col: 0\n          max_col: 2\n        height: 3\n        width: 3\n    transformation:\n      type: \"extract_and_resize\"\n      preserved_color: 1\n      notes: \"Output grid is the bounding box of the blue object in the input.\"\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input:\n      object_count: 2\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 7\n          max_row: 9\n          min_col: 12\n          max_col: 15\n        height: 3\n        width: 4\n    output:\n      object_count: 1\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 0\n          max_row: 2\n          min_col: 0\n          max_col: 3\n        height: 3\n        width: 4\n    transformation:\n      type: \"extract_and_resize\"\n      preserved_color: 1\n      notes: \"Output grid is the bounding box of the blue object in the input.\"\n\n  - example_id: 3 # Test Input\n    input:\n      object_count: 2 #From the description\n      blue_object:\n        exists: true\n        bounding_box:\n          min_row: 6\n          max_row: 8\n          min_col: 14\n          max_col: 19\n        height: 3\n        width: 6\n\n    transformation:\n        type: \"extract_and_resize\"\n        preserved_color: 1\n        notes: \"predict output\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Blue Object:** Find the largest contiguous block of blue (color 1) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the bounding box of this blue object (min\\_row, max\\_row, min\\_col, max\\_col).\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid that is a subgrid of the original input grid, defined by the blue objects bounding box.\n4.
