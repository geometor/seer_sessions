The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2), with a single gray (5) pixel in the input. The output grid contains only white and red pixels. It appears that a specific red object or cluster is being extracted from the input, and the gray pixel's location is not relevant to the output. The relative positions of red pixels within the extracted object are preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider pixels adjacent horizontally or vertically to be part of the same cluster.\n2. **Select Target Cluster**: Choose the red cluster which has the top-left red pixel at [2,2].\n3. **Define Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that fully encloses the selected red cluster.\n4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the section of the input grid corresponding to the coordinates of that bounding box. In this case, the minimal bounding box that encloses the selected cluster in input is a 2x2 box.\n5. **Adjust Size**: Enlarge bounding box by 1 in all directions, by adding a white pixel around the object, if possible.\n6.  **Output:** The extracted 3x3 subgrid is the output.\n\nEssentially, the program isolates a particular red cluster in the input, defines a box around that cluster, and resizes it by one in all directions. The position and color of other non-red pixels do not affect the transformation.\n"
