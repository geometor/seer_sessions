## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x777851601D10>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
1 3 1
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851601BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid appears to be larger (10x10) than the output grid (3x3). The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: blue (1) and green (3), while the rest of the grid is white (0). The output grid combines these colored regions, with the blue and green overlapping.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        shape: rectangle
        location: bottom-left corner
      - color: green
        value: 3
        shape: rectangle
        location: center
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: green
        value: 3

actions:
  - type: combine
    input:
      - object: input_grid
        part: blue rectangle
      - object: input_grid
        part: green rectangle
    output: output_grid

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: The blue and green rectangles in the input grid are spatially separated.
   - type: size
     description: input grid > output grid
   - type: content_mapping
     description:  The colored regions of the input grid define content and positioning of the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** In the input grid, locate all distinct, contiguous regions of non-white (non-zero) pixels. In this specific example, find the blue (1) rectangle and the green (3) rectangle.

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** A 3x3 grid centered on green, and overlaps the corner of blue if the blue square was 2 up.

3. **Overlay.**: Blue occupies the top row and first column, green occupies the bottom row and the last column, overlapping will show whichever color was evaluated last.

4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill in the output grid. Blue overwrites the green in top left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
