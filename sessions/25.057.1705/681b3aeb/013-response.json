The input grid appears to be larger (10x10) than the output grid (3x3). The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: blue (1) and green (3), while the rest of the grid is white (0). The output grid combines these colored regions, with the blue and green overlapping.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
