    transformation: "Create a 3x3 grid. Place key pixels of each object from the input, maintaining relative positions, into the output grid.  Object 1 (blue) forms an 'L' shape, with its leftmost pixel at the top-left corner of output.  Object 2's (green) rightmost pixel is at bottom-right of output. The empty space in output is color 0."
