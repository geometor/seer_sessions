The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4). The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid with minimal changes. The most notable change is the introduction of a single yellow pixel in the bottom row of the output grid, while the green pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
