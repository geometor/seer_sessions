The colors and their arrangement in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid, but the specific rule isn't immediately obvious. There's a reduction in the dimensions of the grid. There appear to be some sort of selection and filtering based on color and relative position of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If there are equal number of distinct values, use the other rule. In the last column of the input we see `[1, 0, 1, 0]` there are two `1` and two `0`. In this case we can find a corresponding column in the output, `[1, 0, 9, 0]` by alternating and starting with `1`.\n\n4. **Final output**: The values from the identified columns form the output.\n\n"
