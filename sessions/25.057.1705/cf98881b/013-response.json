The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed version, primarily featuring yellow (4) and maroon (9), with some white (0) and blue (1) in specific locations. The output grid appears to be a 4x4 square, while the input grid is 4x15. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple sub-sampling or direct mapping of regions. There's likely a rule based on the presence, arrangement, or interaction of colors in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
