## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 4 4 0 2 9 9 0 9 2 0 1 0 1
0 4 0 4 2 0 0 9 0 2 0 1 0 0
0 4 0 4 2 0 0 9 9 2 1 0 0 1
4 0 4 4 2 9 9 9 0 2 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7778516D1770>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 9
0 4 9 4
1 4 9 4
4 9 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x777851601D10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed version, primarily featuring yellow (4) and maroon (9), with some white (0) and blue (1) in specific locations. The output grid appears to be a 4x4 square, while the input grid is 4x15. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple sub-sampling or direct mapping of regions. There's likely a rule based on the presence, arrangement, or interaction of colors in the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 4x15
  colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]
  objects:
    - type: pixel_cluster
      color: 4 #yellow
      description: Forms the background of output grid
    - type: pixel
      color: 9 #maroon
      description: Appears to replace clusters of other colors in input
    - type: pixel
        color: 0 #white
        description: appear in second row, first column
    - type: pixel
        color: 1 #blue
        description: appear in third row, first column
output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 4x4
  colors: [0, 1, 4, 9]
  objects:
     - type: pixel_cluster
       color: 4
       description: Forms L shape
     - type: pixel
       color: 9
       description: placed between the arms of the L shape
     - type: pixel
       color: 0
       description: top left
     - type: pixel
       color: 1
       description: below the white pixel
relationships:
  - type: condensation
    description: The input grid is condensed into a smaller output grid.
  - type: color_dominance
    description: Yellow (4) and Maroon (9) are dominant in the output.
  - type: positional_rule
    description: the single 0 and 1 in output are based on first column of
      input

actions:
    - select_color:
        description: select the most important colors from the input to build the output
    - replace_color:
        description: replaces areas of color other than yellow with maroon
    - position_pixel:
        description: 0 and 1 from first column in input are positioned at top of first column

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Special Pixels**: In the first column of the input grid, identify any pixels that have colors other than yellow (4).
2.  **Create Output Grid Shell:** construct the output grid by creating L shape of yellow(4), with a maroon (9) in between the arms of the L.
3.  **Copy and place special pixels**: If special pixel exists, make a copy and place at top of first column, with the second pixel below
4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining spaces in output with maroon (9).

In summary, the transformation creates an output image based on yellow background. The key elements of input (first column) are placed in the first column of the output, then the rest of the background is filled.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
