The input grid appears to have distinct regions of different colors. There are horizontal and vertical lines of single colors.\n*   **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid, also of colored pixels. The output grid seems to be a subset or a filtered version of the input grid. The size reduction is significant.\n* **Transformation**: It's not immediately obvious *what* determines inclusion in the output. It could be color-based, position-based, or some combination. The spatial relationships seem important, columns are maintained.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The selected columns from the input are: 1, 3, 9 and 12 (using zero-based indexing).\n2.  **Output Construction:** Create a new grid using only the selected columns. Maintain the original row order and values within each column. The new grid will have dimensions equal to the original number of rows, and columns equal to the number of selected columns.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts columns 1, 3, 9, and 12 from the input grid to produce the output.\n"
