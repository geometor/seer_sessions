Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialize:** Create a 4x4 output grid and fill it entirely with yellow (color 4).
2.  **Set Origin:** Place a black (color 0) pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
3.  **Locate Yellow Line:** Find the vertical line of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Place Maroon Pixels (Conditional):**
    *   Find maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.
    *   If one maroon pixel is found *and* it is to the right of the yellow line, place it in the output grid at position (1,1) if on the second row of the input grid, and (2,1) if it's on the third row of the input grid.
5. **Place Blue Pixel (Conditional):**
    *   Find a blue pixel (1) in the input grid.
    *   If a blue pixel is found, and is to the right of the yellow line, place it at the row corresponding to its row in the input grid and at the first column (column 0) in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
