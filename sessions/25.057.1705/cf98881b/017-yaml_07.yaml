      - description: Input grid
        properties:
          - First column contains yellow, blue, and green pixels
          - Non-yellow pixels in the first column: 2
      - description: Output grid
        properties:
          - First column contains blue, green, and maroon pixels, stacked, and then yellow.
          - Non-yellow pixels (including maroon): 4 (2 original + 2 maroon)
    actions:
      - Extract the first column of the input.
      - Identify non-yellow pixels.
      - Stack non-yellow pixels, then an equal number of maroon pixels, then fill with yellow.
      - Output grid is 4x4.

        properties:
          - First column contains yellow, green, and red pixels.
          - Non-yellow pixels in first column: 3
      - description: Output grid
        properties:
          - First column contains green, red, and maroon pixels, stacked, and then yellow.
          - Non-yellow pixels (including maroon): 6 (3 original + 3 maroon).
    actions:
        - Extract first column
        - Stack the non-yellow pixels from input
        - add same count of maroon pixels
        - fill remaining with yellow
        - output grid is 6x6

            - first column contains yellow and gray pixels
            - non-yellow pixel in the first column: 1
        - description: output grid
          properties:
            - first column contains a gray and maroon pixel
            - Non-yellow pixels(including maroon): 2 (1 original + 1 maroon)
    actions:
        - Extract first column
        - Stack the non-yellow pixels
        - add same count of maroon pixels
        - fill remaining with yellow
