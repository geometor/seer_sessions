## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 4 0 4 2 9 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0 2 0 0 9 9 2 0 1 0 0
4 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 0
4 4 4 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x777851601D10>

**output:**
```
9 4 0 4
0 4 9 9
4 1 1 0
4 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7778516D1450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9). The input grid appears to have distinct regions of different colors. There are horizontal and vertical lines of single colors.
*   **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid, also of colored pixels. The output grid seems to be a subset or a filtered version of the input grid. The size reduction is significant.
* **Transformation**: It's not immediately obvious *what* determines inclusion in the output. It could be color-based, position-based, or some combination. The spatial relationships seem important, columns are maintained.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid is 4x14 (rows x columns).
    attributes:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]
        names:  [white, blue, red, yellow, maroon]
      - size: [4, 14]
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid is 4x4 (rows x columns).
    attributes:
      - colors: [0, 1, 4, 9]
        names: [white, blue, yellow, maroon]
      - size: [4, 4]
  - type: observation
    description: Output grid retains the same number of rows as the input, but fewer columns.
  - type: observation
    description: All colors in the output grid are present in the input grid.
  - type: observation
    description: Columns 1, 3, 9, and 12 from the input grid are present in the output grid.
    map:
        input_column: [1,3,9,12] # zero index
        output_column: [0,1,2,3]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Column Selection:** Select specific columns from the input grid. The selected columns from the input are: 1, 3, 9 and 12 (using zero-based indexing).
2.  **Output Construction:** Create a new grid using only the selected columns. Maintain the original row order and values within each column. The new grid will have dimensions equal to the original number of rows, and columns equal to the number of selected columns.

Essentially, the transformation extracts columns 1, 3, 9, and 12 from the input grid to produce the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
