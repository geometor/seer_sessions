The input grid has a white (0) pixel in the center and blue (1) pixels elsewhere. The output grid alternates white (0) and blue (1) pixels in a checkerboard pattern, with white pixels in the corners and center. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the blue pixels to white based on their position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
