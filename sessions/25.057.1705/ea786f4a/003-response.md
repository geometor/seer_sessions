Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too specific, focusing solely on changing the corner pixels to white. While this worked for the first training example, it failed for the others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't about *corners* specifically, but about identifying a particular shape (a rectangle defined by a specific color) and changing *its* corners. The original program was hard-coded to change the grid corners, not the corners of a detected object.

My strategy is to shift the focus from "grid corners" to "corners of a detected rectangle." I need to:

1.  **Identify the Rectangle:** Determine how the target rectangle is identified across all examples. It is likely indicated by a unique color.
2.  **Find the Rectangle's Corners:** Once the rectangle is identified, locate its corner coordinates.
3.  **Change Corner Colors:** Change the color of those identified corners to white (0).

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results, see attached file for execution output):**

import numpy as np

def get_rectangle_info(grid):
    """
    Identifies a rectangle in the grid and returns its corner coordinates and color.
    Assumes the rectangle is the largest contiguous block of a single, non-white color.

    """
    colors = np.unique(grid)
    colors = colors[colors != 0]  # Exclude white (background)
    max_area = 0
    target_color = None
    
    for color in colors:
       
        rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)
        if len(rows) > 0:
            
            min_row, max_row = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)
            min_col, max_col = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)
           
            area = (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
                target_color = color

    if target_color is None:
        return None, None, None

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      rectangle_color: 1  # blue
      rectangle_corners: [(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)]
      action: "Change color of rectangle corners to 0 (white)"
  - example_2:
      rectangle_color: 1  # blue
      rectangle_corners: [(2, 2), (2, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)]
      action: "Change color of rectangle corners to 0 (white)"
  - example_3:
      rectangle_color: 1 # blue
      rectangle_corners:  [(2, 2), (2, 6), (5, 2), (5, 6)]
      action: "Change color of rectangle corners to 0 (white)"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Rectangle:** Find the largest contiguous rectangular region of pixels that share the same color, excluding white (color 0).  This color is consistently blue (1) in the examples.
2.  **Locate Corners:** Determine the row and column indices of the four corner pixels of this rectangle. The corners are defined by the minimum and maximum row and column values of the pixels belonging to the rectangle.
3.  **Recolor Corners:** Change the color of the four identified corner pixels to white (0).
