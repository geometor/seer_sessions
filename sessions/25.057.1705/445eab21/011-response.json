            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates to the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were designed to identify 2x2 squares of any non-black color and reproduce them as the output. This worked for the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the logic is too simplistic.  The code correctly identifies 2x2 squares and reproduces, but the choice of WHICH square to reproduce needs refinement, and the error cases need to be defined. The current implementation returns an empty 2x2 grid if no 2x2 square is found. This is incorrect. The expected output could be a single pixel, or a different configuration of the same color.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Prioritize Square Selection:** The core issue seems to be *which* 2x2 square is selected when multiple exist. The examples suggest a selection criteria based on position, likely the top-left most square.\n2.  **Handle Non-Square Cases:** When no 2x2 square is found, the existing code returns a blank 2x2 grid. This default needs to change. We need to analyze these no-square-found cases to determine the correct fallback logic, finding single color and single output.\n3. **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the object identification is robust, including diagonals.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nTo analyze the results effectively, I'll use a structured approach focusing on key features:\n\n*   **Input:**  A brief description of the input grid.\n*   **Expected Output:** Description of the expected output grid.\n*   **Actual Output:** Description of the actual output from the `transform` function.\n*   **Objects Found:** The objects detected by `find_objects`.\n*   **2x2 Squares:** Whether a 2x2 square was found, and if so, its color and location.\n*   **Correct?**  Yes/No, indicating if the `transform` function produced the correct output.\n*   **Analysis:** Explanation of why the output was correct or incorrect, and any insights.\n\nLet's apply this to each example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 6x6 grid with a blue 2x2 square at the top-left.\n*   **Expected Output:** 2x2 blue square.\n*   **Actual Output:** 2x2 blue square.\n*   **Objects Found:**  `{1: [[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]]}`\n*   **2x2 Squares:** Yes, Blue, (0,0)\n*   **Correct?** Yes.\n*   **Analysis:** The code correctly identified and reproduced the 2x2 square.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 8x8 grid with two 2x2 squares: red (top-left) and blue (bottom-right).\n*   **Expected Output:** 2x2 red square.\n*   **Actual Output:** 2x2 red square.\n*   **Objects Found:** `{2: [[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]], 1: [[(5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)]]}`\n*   **2x2 Squares:** Yes, Red (0,0) and Blue (5,5)\n*   **Correct?** Yes.\n*   **Analysis:** The code selected the *first* 2x2 square it found, which happened to be the correct one (red, top-left). This hints at a selection rule: prioritize top-left squares.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:**  11x11 grid with a green 2x2 square and scattered green pixels, also a 1x1 object composed of the color orange.\n*   **Expected Output:** 2x2 green square.\n*   **Actual Output:** 2x2 green square.\n*   **Objects Found:** `{3: [[(0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 9), (1, 10)], [(4, 5)], [(9, 1)]], 7: [[(5, 0)]]}`\n*   **2x2 Squares:** Yes, Green, (0,9)\n*   **Correct?** Yes.\n*   **Analysis:**  Correctly identifies and outputs the 2x2 green square, ignoring other single green and orange pixels.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*   **Input:** 9x9 grid with various single-colored pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** 1x1 yellow pixel.\n*   **Actual Output:** 2x2 all-zero grid.\n*   **Objects Found:** `{4: [[(0, 4)]], 2: [[(2, 2)]], 3: [[(6, 6)]], 1: [[(8, 0)]]}`\n*   **2x2 Squares:** No.\n*   **Correct?** No.\n*   **Analysis:** The code failed to handle the case where no 2x2 square exists. The expected output is a single yellow pixel, indicating a fallback rule to select a single-pixel object of a specific color, when no squares are present.\n\n**Example 5:**\n\n*   **Input:** 11x11 grid with some diagonal orange lines, and single-color pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** 1x1 orange pixel.\n*   **Actual Output:** 2x2 all-zero grid.\n*   **Objects Found:** `{7: [[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)], [(6, 1)]], 1: [[(4, 9)]], 2: [[(10, 0)]]}`\n*   **2x2 Squares:** No\n*   **Correct?** No\n*   **Analysis:** Similar to Example 4, the code fails when no 2x2 square is present. It should output a single orange pixel, not a blank grid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: 2x2 squares\n    selection_criteria:\n      - top_left_most: True\n      - color_priority: None # To be determined if necessary\n    properties:\n      - size: 2x2\n      - shape: square\n      - contiguity: adjacent\n  - description: Single pixels\n    selection_criteria:\n        - color_priority: [yellow, orange] # From example 4 and 5\n    properties:\n      - size: 1x1\n      - shape: point\n      - contiguity: isolated\n\nactions:\n  - action: select_object\n    conditions:\n      - if: 2x2 square exists\n        then: select top-left-most square\n      - else:\n        select: a single yellow pixel if available. If not, select a single orange pixel.\n  - action: create_output\n    conditions:\n       - if: a 2x2 square object was selected\n         then: create a 2x2 output matching square location and color\n       - else: create a 1x1 output and place the selected pixel at (0,0)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same color in the input grid.  Consider adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).\n2.  **Find 2x2 Squares:** Check if any of the identified objects are 2x2 squares.\n3.  **Prioritize and Select:**\n    *   If multiple 2x2 squares exist, select the top-left-most square.\n    *   If one 2x2 square, select.\n    *   If no 2x2 squares exist, select a single yellow pixel if available. If not, select a single orange pixel.\n4.  **Create Output:**\n    *   If a 2x2 square was selected, create a 2x2 output grid of the same color and position as the selected square.\n    *   If a single pixel was selected, create a 1x1 output grid with the selected color.\n\nThis revised natural language program incorporates the lessons learned from all five training examples. It prioritizes 2x2 square selection and includes specific fallback logic for cases where no such squares are found.\n"
