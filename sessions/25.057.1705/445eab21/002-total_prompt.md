## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7778516D1450>

**output:**
```
8 8
8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7778518FB430>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into a smaller grid. The input grid appears to contain two distinct shapes, one orange (7) and one azure (8), against a white background (0). The output grid seems to be derived from only a portion of the input grid, specifically focusing on azure colored pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 10x10, output grid is 2x2.
  - objects:
      - object1:
          color: orange (7)
          shape: irregular, resembling a mirrored 'L'
          position: top-left quadrant
      - object2:
          color: azure (8)
          shape: irregular, resembling an 'L'
          position: bottom-center
      - background:
          color: white (0)
  - actions:
      - selection:  A portion of input containing azure pixels is selected
      - extraction: The selected portion forms a 2x2 subsquare containing the azure pixels
  - relationships:
      - object2 is the source of the output
      - The corners of the minimal bounding rectangle around the azure object are defined.
      - the section of the grid is isolated and forms the new grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid based on contiguous regions of the same color. Ignore the white background (0) and any objects not azure.
2.  **Focus on Azure:** Select the azure (8) colored object.
3.  **Find Corners:** Locate the smallest rectangle which can bound all the pixels that belong to an object colored azure.
4. **Construct Subgrid:** A new subgrid from this information. The topleft pixel of the azure object will be the origin of the new grid, the size of the subgrid will equal the width and height of the bounding box
5.  **Output:** Return new grid as output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
