            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on the azure object as a key element.  However, the testing revealed that the transformation is *solely* an extraction of the azure object's bounding box. The initial hypothesis about including *other* objects within the bounding box, or using relative offsets, is incorrect. The examples demonstrate a simple sub-grid extraction. The strategy is to simplify the natural language program and code to reflect this direct extraction.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis (using manual inspection for brevity, but code execution could be used for large datasets)**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Azure Object Present: Yes\n    *   Correct Output: No\n    * Notes: output is correct extraction\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (15, 15)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 7)\n    *   Azure Object Present: Yes\n    *   Correct Output: No\n      Notes: output is correct extraction\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 3)\n    *   Azure Object Present: Yes\n    *   Correct Output: No\n      Notes: output is correct extraction\n\n**YAML Summary**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_shape: [10, 10]\n    output_shape: [3, 5]\n    azure_object:\n      present: true\n      bounding_box:\n        top_left: [3, 4]\n        bottom_right: [5, 8]\n    transformation: \"Extract azure bounding box\"\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_shape: [15, 15]\n    output_shape: [4, 7]\n    azure_object:\n      present: true\n      bounding_box:\n        top_left: [3, 5]\n        bottom_right: [6, 11]\n      transformation: \"Extract azure bounding box\"\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_shape: [10, 10]\n    output_shape: [2, 3]\n    azure_object:\n      present: true\n      bounding_box:\n        top_left: [7, 1]\n        bottom_right: [8, 3]\n    transformation: \"Extract azure bounding box\"\n\noverall_transformation: \"The output grid is a direct extraction of the bounding box of the azure (color 8) object in the input grid. If no azure object is present, the output is an empty grid.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Azure Object:** Examine the input grid to locate any contiguous regions of azure (color code 8) pixels. These regions constitute \"objects.\"\n2.  **Bounding Box:** If an azure object is found, determine its bounding box. The bounding box is defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the azure pixels.\n3. **Direct Extraction:** Create a new grid whose dimensions match the height and width of the azure object's bounding box. Copy the pixel values from the input grid that fall *within* the bounding box to the corresponding locations in the output grid.\n4.  **No Azure Case:** If no azure object is found, the output is an empty grid (zero dimensions).\n\n"
