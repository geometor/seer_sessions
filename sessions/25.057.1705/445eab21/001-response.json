The input grid appears to contain two distinct shapes, one orange (7) and one azure (8), against a white background (0). The output grid seems to be derived from only a portion of the input grid, specifically focusing on azure colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Ignore the white background (0) and any objects not azure.\n2.  **Focus on Azure:** Select the azure (8) colored object.\n3.  **Find Corners:** Locate the smallest rectangle which can bound all the pixels that belong to an object colored azure.\n4. **Construct Subgrid:** A new subgrid from this information. The topleft pixel of the azure object will be the origin of the new grid, the size of the subgrid will equal the width and height of the bounding box\n5.  **Output:** Return new grid as output.\n"
