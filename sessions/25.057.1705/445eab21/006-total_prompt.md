Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid, focusing particularly on azure (8) colored objects. Other colored objects should also be noted, as they might be relevant.
2.  **Azure Focus:**  If an azure object exists, determine its bounding box.
3.  **Relational Extraction:** The output grid's dimensions and content are determined by the azure object's bounding box, *and the relationship of pixels within and potentially around the box*. It is not a simple extraction of the bounding box contents. The relationship might involve:
    *   **Complete Inclusion:** If other objects or parts of objects are *fully contained* within the azure object's bounding box, they are included in the output.
    * **Relative Offset:** If the examples show a consistent offset or shift of other colored pixels relative to the azure object's position, apply this offset to extract the relevant region from the input grid.
    * **Partial Inclusion**: Parts of other objects outside of the bounding box may be relevant.
4.  **Output Construction:** Create a new grid. Copy the pixels from input to output grid, according the relation extraction.
5. **No Azure Case:** If there is not azure object, output an empty grid.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on the azure object as a key element.  However, the testing revealed that the transformation is *solely* an extraction of the azure object's bounding box. The initial hypothesis about including *other* objects within the bounding box, or using relative offsets, is incorrect. The examples demonstrate a simple sub-grid extraction. The strategy is to simplify the natural language program and code to reflect this direct extraction.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using manual inspection for brevity, but code execution could be used for large datasets)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 5)
    *   Azure Object Present: Yes
    *   Correct Output: No
    * Notes: output is correct extraction
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (15, 15)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 7)
    *   Azure Object Present: Yes
    *   Correct Output: No
      Notes: output is correct extraction
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)
    *   Output Shape: (2, 3)
    *   Azure Object Present: Yes
    *   Correct Output: No
      Notes: output is correct extraction

    transformation: "Extract azure bounding box"

overall_transformation: "The output grid is a direct extraction of the bounding box of the azure (color 8) object in the input grid. If no azure object is present, the output is an empty grid."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Azure Object:** Examine the input grid to locate any contiguous regions of azure (color code 8) pixels. These regions constitute "objects."
2.  **Bounding Box:** If an azure object is found, determine its bounding box. The bounding box is defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the azure pixels.
3. **Direct Extraction:** Create a new grid whose dimensions match the height and width of the azure object's bounding box. Copy the pixel values from the input grid that fall *within* the bounding box to the corresponding locations in the output grid.
4.  **No Azure Case:** If no azure object is found, the output is an empty grid (zero dimensions).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
