## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x777851601DB0>

**output:**
```
7 7
7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7778516D1450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is a 2x2 grid. The input grid contains two distinct colored regions (magenta and orange, represented by 6 and 7, respectively) surrounded by a background of white (0). The output grid consists only of orange (7) pixels, arranged in a 2x2 square. The magenta (6) colored pixels and white colored pixels are not present in the output. The orange object in input is not a simple shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: obj1
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: irregular, L-shaped in upper left
    size: 8 pixels
    position: top-left quadrant

  - id: obj2
    color: orange (7)
    shape: irregular, inverted U-shape
    size: 8 pixels
    position: bottom-center

  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: fills remaining space
    position: surrounds obj1 and obj2

  - id: output_object
    color: orange (7)
    shape: square
    size: 4 pixels
    position: not applicable
    relation_to_input: derived from obj2

relationships:
  - obj1 is surrounded by background
  - obj2 is surrounded by background
  - obj2 is the source of the output_object
  - obj1 doesn't appear on output
actions:
  - selection: only the obj2 is used to make the final output
  - transformation: A transformation from the input irregular shape to the square output shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored regions within the input grid.
2.  **Select Color:** Select the orange (7) object. Ignore all others.
3. **Simplify Shape**: Select a 2x2 square of orange colored pixels, ignoring the rest.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
