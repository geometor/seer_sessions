The output is a smaller grid containing only one color (yellow, represented by '4') extracted from the input. The input grid contains several distinct colored regions (green '3', yellow '4', and magenta '6', as well as many white '0' pixels), while the output grid consists of only the yellow pixels arranged in a filled rectangle. The position and size of the rectangle in the output do not obviously correlate to the position of the colored regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
