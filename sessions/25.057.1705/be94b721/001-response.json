The input grid contains several distinct colored regions (red, green, and blue, represented by values 2, 3, and 1, respectively) against a white background (value 0). The output grid seems to focus on a single color from the input (red, value 2), preserving its shape and relative position but cropping out the rest of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
