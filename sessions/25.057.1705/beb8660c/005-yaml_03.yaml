example_1:
  objects:
    - type: horizontal_segment
      color: blue (1)
      length: 3
      row: 4
    - type: horizontal_segment
      color: red (2)
      length: 2
      row: 7
  transformation:
    - action: consolidate_and_move
      description: Consolidate segments of the same color within the same row.  Move the consolidated segment to the right edge of the row, maintaining the original row and segment color. Single pixels of a color are treated as segments of length 1.
example_2:
  objects:
      - type: horizontal_segment
        color: magenta (6)
        length: 2
        row: 1
      - type: horizontal_segment
        color: orange (7)
        length: 4
        row: 3
  transformation:
    - action: consolidate_and_shift
      description:  Segments in each row shift by a fixed amount, in this example two pixels to the right. Segments of same color are consolidated.
example_3:
  objects:
    - type: horizontal_segment
      color: blue (1)
      length: 1
      row: 2
    - type: horizontal_segment
      color: green (3)
      length: 3
      row: 4
  transformation:
    - action: consolidate_and_shift
      description: Segments in each row shift by a fixed amount based on their original column position, in this example two pixels to the right. Segments of same color are consolidated.
