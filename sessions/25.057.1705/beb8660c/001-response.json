The input grid contains several horizontal bars of different colors and lengths, positioned at various locations. The output grid shows these bars rearranged, seemingly sorted by their original vertical position, and shifted to the right side of the grid. Empty spaces (represented by '0' or white) are filled in accordingly. The overall grid dimensions appear to remain constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A horizontal bar is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding color 0 (white).\n2.  **Record Properties:** For each bar, record its color, length, and the row index of its leftmost pixel.\n3.  **Sort Bars:** Sort the bars based on their recorded row index. Maintain the relative order of bars that start on the same row.\n4. **Create New Grid**: Initialize a new grid.\n5.  **Place Bars:** Iterate through the sorted bars. For each bar:\n    *   Calculate its starting column index for right alignment: `grid_width` - `bar_length`.\n    *   Place the bar on the next available row in the output grid, starting from the calculated column index, moving to the rows below.\n6.  **Fill Empty Spaces:** Fill all remaining cells in the output grid with color 0 (white).\n7.  **Return New Grid:** Return the new grid.\n\n"
