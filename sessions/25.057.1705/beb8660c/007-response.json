The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x4).  There are distinct horizontal lines of single colors (blue, red, green, azure) in the input. The output seems to reorder these lines, and some empty rows are inserted while other empty rows are deleted. The order of the colored lines appears to relate to the row index they initially occupy.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
