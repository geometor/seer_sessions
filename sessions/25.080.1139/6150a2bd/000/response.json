The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (at least in these two examples). The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and possibly a mirroring or rotation. The order of the digits (colors) within each row is also altered. There is a consistent change applied to rows from input to output\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
