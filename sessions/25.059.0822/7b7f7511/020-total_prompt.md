Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid is created by copying rows from the top of the input grid. The number of rows copied is equal to `input_rows // 2`.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms an input grid by taking the top n rows of it, where n is input_rows // 2."""
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate the number of rows in the output grid (input rows // 2).
    output_rows = rows // 2

    # Initialize the output grid with the correct dimensions.
    output_grid = np.empty((output_rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # Copy the top n rows of the input grid to the output grid.
    output_grid = input_grid[:output_rows, :]
    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided Python code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple observation: taking the top half of the rows. While this worked for the first example, it's clear from the subsequent test results that this rule is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full transformation logic. The core issue is that the number of rows to be copied is NOT always `input_rows // 2`. It varies from example to example. We need a more dynamic way to determine which rows to copy.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to understand the specific row selection logic.
2.  **Identify a Pattern:** Look for a consistent relationship between the input and output grids that determines which rows are copied. It is probably related to colors of lines.
3.  **Refine the Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed pattern.
4. **Update Code:** Update the python code.
5.  **Re-test:** Test again on all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To accurately assess the relationship I will do the following:
*   For each input grid, determine the height and width.
*   For each output grid, determine the height and width.
*   Compare row by row to determine a relationship.

def describe_grid(grid, grid_name):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    print(f"{grid_name}:")
    print(f"  Dimensions: {rows} x {cols}")
    for i in range(rows):
        row_str = " ".join(str(x) for x in grid[i])
        print(f"  Row {i}: {row_str}")

examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
        "output": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]),
        "output": np.array([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8]])
    },
     {
        "input": np.array([[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]),
        "output": np.array([[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]])
    },
     {
        "input": np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]),
        "output": np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
