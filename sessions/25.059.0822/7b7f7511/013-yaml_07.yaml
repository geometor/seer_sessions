observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: same as input_grid
      columns: half the number of columns of input_grid
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - actions:
    - name: combine_columns
      description: For each pair of adjacent columns in the input grid, a corresponding column is produced. The value of the pixel at [row][col] in output is equal to max of the values of [row][col*2] and [row][col*2+1]
      inputs: two adjacent columns from input_grid
      output: single column in output_grid
      operation: element-wise maximum
