"""
The transformation rule is to reduce the width of the input grid by half while maintaining the original height. The contents of the output grid are derived by combining pairs of adjacent columns from the input grid. Specifically, for each output column `i`, the corresponding input columns `2*i` and `2*i + 1` are considered. The new width of the output grid is therefore half the width of the input grid.
