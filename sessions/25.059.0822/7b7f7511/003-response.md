Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares. The input grid appears to be transformed into a smaller output grid. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (1, 2, and 3, corresponding to blue, red, and green, respectively). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the dimensions of the grid, specifically, removing columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - cells: color_values (integers)
    relations:
      - adjacent: (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - type: column_removal
    details: removes specific columns from the grid

observations:
  - input_grid_dimensions: (4, 8)
  - output_grid_dimensions: (4, 4)
  - removed_columns : [4,5,6,7,8] #from right and [1,2,3,4] from left? Neither. [5,7] perhaps
  - color_values: [1, 2, 3]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to remove every other column starting on the right and moving towards the left, or starting at column 5 and deleting every other column. In this example, take the original input and create a new grid, keeping columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, skipping 5, keeping 6, and skipping 7.

Alternatively, the last four columns are removed. And of those remaining four, only keep columns 1,3,5,7,
