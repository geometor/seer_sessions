Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is divided into four equal-sized quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. 
If the grid has an odd number of rows or columns, the "middle" row/column is included in both the top/bottom or left/right quadrants, respectively (effectively creating overlapping quadrants).

For each quadrant, find the most frequent non-white color. Iterate through each quadrant, and find the *first* non-white color.

Create a 2x2 output grid. The value of each cell in the output grid corresponds to the first non-white color found in the respective quadrant of the input grid:

*   output[0, 0] = first non-white color in the top-left quadrant.
*   output[0, 1] = first non-white color in the top-right quadrant.
*   output[1, 0] = first non-white color in the bottom-left quadrant.
*   output[1, 1] = first non-white color in the bottom-right quadrant.

If a quadrant contains only white pixels, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be 0 (white).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the concept of dividing the input grid into four quadrants and identifying the first non-white color in each. This approach worked for the first example, but the results on the other examples indicate that the logic needs adjustments. The core issue seems to be that the rule for picking the color needs to change to use first instead of most frequent. The quadrant approach seems to work for example 2, but example 3 needs to be handled differently. It appears the size of the input is significant, so different approaches may be required based on dimensions.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the dimensions of the input/output grids and the result of the `transform` function:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 3x3
    *   Output Dimensions: 2x2
    *   Result: Correct. The code correctly identifies the first non-white color in each quadrant.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Dimensions: 6x6
    *   Output Dimensions: 2x2
    *   Result: Correct.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input Dimensions: 1x11
    *   Output Dimensions: 1x1
    *   Result: Incorrect. The current logic doesn't apply here and should return the middlemost pixel. It must be adapted to return a 1x1 output.

**YAML Fact Block**

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a revised natural language program that attempts to encompass all training examples:

1.  **Check Input Dimensions:** Examine the dimensions of the input grid.

2.  **Handle 1xN and Nx1 Inputs:** If the input grid has only one row *or* one column, the output is a 1x1 grid.
    *   Find the middle element of the input grid. The output grid's single cell will have the value of that input element.

3.  **Handle Other Inputs (>= 2x2):** If the input grid has more than one row and more than one column:
    *   Divide the input grid into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. If the grid has an odd number of rows or columns, the "middle" row/column is included in both the top/bottom and left/right quadrants, respectively.
    *   Create a 2x2 output grid.
    *   For each quadrant:
        *   Find the *first* non-white (non-zero) color in the quadrant when iterating by row, then by column.
        *   Set the corresponding cell in the 2x2 output grid to the color found:
            *   Top-left quadrant color -> output\[0, 0]
            *   Top-right quadrant color -> output\[0, 1]
            *   Bottom-left quadrant color -> output\[1, 0]
            *   Bottom-right quadrant color -> output\[1, 1]
        *   If a quadrant contains *only* white pixels, the corresponding cell in the output grid remains 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
