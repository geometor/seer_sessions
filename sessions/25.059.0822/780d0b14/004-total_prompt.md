Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my breakdown of the input and output, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input appears to be a large grid (20x20) composed of four distinct colored regions: blue (1), azure (8), magenta (6), and white (0). These regions seem to form large, somewhat irregular blocks. The output is a much smaller 2x2 grid containing the numbers 1, 8, 6, and 1, which correspond to blue, azure, and magenta colors from the input grid. The white color (0) is not represented in output. The output grid appears to summarize or represent the larger input grid in some way related to the arrangement of the colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [20, 20]
      colors: [0, 1, 6, 8] # white, blue, magenta, azure
      regions:
        - color: 1 # Blue
          shape: irregular block
        - color: 8  # Azure
          shape: irregular block
        - color: 6 # Magenta
          shape: irregular block
        - color: 0 # white
          shape: irregular block filling spaces

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [2, 2]
      colors: [ 1, 8, 6, 1 ]

actions:
  - type: summarize
    input: large grid
    output: small grid
    description: The large grid is reduced to its color components in top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right order.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The 2x2 output grid reflects the color of upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right quadrants of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Conceptually divide the input grid into four equal quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
2.  **Identify Dominant Color (excluding white):** For each quadrant, identify a non-white color that is in that quadrant.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
    *   The top-left cell of the output grid corresponds to the identified color of the top-left input quadrant.
    *   The top-right cell of the output grid corresponds to the identified color of the top-right input quadrant.
    *   The bottom-left cell of the output grid corresponds to the identified color of the bottom-left input quadrant.
    *   The bottom-right cell of the output grid corresponds to the identified color of the bottom-right input quadrant.

In essence, the program identifies large color regions in the input grid.
It does this, conceptually, by dividing the original grid into four equal quadrants and recording a color value (that is not white) for each.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
