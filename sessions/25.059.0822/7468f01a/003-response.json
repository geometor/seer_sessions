The input grid is larger and contains a central, irregularly shaped \"object\" composed of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is smaller and seems to be a cropped and slightly rearranged version of the central object in the input. The background is white (0) and is not present in the output at all.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The dimensions of the extraction are not immediately obvious from the single example. It removes all of the white background.\n3. **Rearrange:** The cropped section is then potentially re-arranged. In this specific example, the 2x2 red block is moved from the left to the top right part of the output, and other smaller shifts happen, so that all of the red squares are together.\n\nEssentially the input figure is cropped down to remove all white space, and re-arranged to group all the red squares at the top.\n"
