Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger and contains a central, irregularly shaped "object" composed of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The output grid is smaller and seems to be a cropped and slightly rearranged version of the central object in the input. The background is white (0) and is not present in the output at all.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, azure, red]
      dimensions: [10, 15]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [azure, red]
      dimensions: [4, 8]
  - name: central_object
    type: irregular_shape
    properties:
        colors: [azure, red]
        location: center of input_grid

actions:
  - name: crop
    agent: unknown
    target: input_grid
    parameters:
      region: area containing the central_object
  - name: rearrange
    agent: unknown
    target: cropped_region
    parameters: {} # Unclear, but involves minor pixel shifts.

relationships:
   - type: CONTAINS
     from: input_grid
     to: central_object
   - type: IS_CROPPED_VERSION_OF
     from: output_grid
     to: central_object

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Object:** Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels (azure and red) in the center of the input grid.
2.  **Crop:** Extract a rectangular region around the central object. The dimensions of the extraction are not immediately obvious from the single example. It removes all of the white background.
3. **Rearrange:** The cropped section is then potentially re-arranged. In this specific example, the 2x2 red block is moved from the left to the top right part of the output, and other smaller shifts happen, so that all of the red squares are together.

Essentially the input figure is cropped down to remove all white space, and re-arranged to group all the red squares at the top.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
