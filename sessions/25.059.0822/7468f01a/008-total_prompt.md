Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains a rectangular block of '4' (yellow) pixels with a smaller rectangle of '1' (blue) pixels embedded within it. The rest of the input grid is filled with '0' (white) pixels. The output grid seems to be a cropped and condensed version of the colored region in the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - size: 12 x 16
      - values: [0, 1, 4]
  - name: yellow_rectangle
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - shape: rectangle
      - position: (row: 1, col: 3)  # Top-left corner
      - size: 5 x 5 # includes the blue, its a bounding box
  - name: blue_rectangle
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - shape: rectangle
      - position: (row: 3, col: 5) # Top-left corner
      - size: 2 x 2
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - size: 5 x 5
      - values: [1, 4]
actions:
  - type: crop
    agent: input_grid
    target: yellow_rectangle  # The region defined by the colored area.
    result: output_grid

relationships:
 - blue_rectangle is_inside yellow_rectangle
 - output_grid contains yellow_rectangle
 - output_grid contains blue_rectangle

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the bounding box:** Find the smallest rectangle within the input grid that encompasses all non-zero (non-white) pixels. This is defined by the outermost '4' (yellow) pixels.
2.  **Crop:** Extract the region of the input grid defined by the bounding box in step 1.
3. **Output the bounding box** The cropped region is the output grid.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the smallest rectangular section of the input grid that contains all the colored pixels, discarding the surrounding white (0) pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
