The extracted region appears to maintain the relative positions and colors of its pixels.  The output grid is a minimal bounding box around the extracted region. Background (white/0) pixels are discarded. The input grids contain a single connected component of non-white pixels. Within the colored region, there appears to be a secondary color, different from the primary color making up the outer shape.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
