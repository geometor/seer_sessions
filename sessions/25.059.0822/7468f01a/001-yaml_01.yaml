facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain a single connected region of non-white pixels.
  - observation: |
      The non-white region contains pixels of at least two different colors.
  - observation: |
      One color forms the outer shape of the connected object.
  - observation: |
      Another different color is contained within the shape.
  - observation: |
      The output is a rectangular subgrid.
  - observation: |
      The output subgrid contains only the non-white pixels from the input.
  - observation: |
      The spatial arrangement of the non-white pixels is preserved in the output.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is the smallest possible rectangle that contains all the non-white pixels.
  - relationship: |
      Output grid dimensions are determined by the extreme row and column indices of the non-white pixels in the input grid.
