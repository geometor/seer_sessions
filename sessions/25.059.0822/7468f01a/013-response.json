The input grid is mostly empty (filled with 0s, representing white). There's a noticeable rectangular block composed of magenta (6) and green (3) pixels. The output grid appears to be a cropped version of the input, containing *only* that colored rectangle, with the whitespace removed. The rectangle in the input is not a solid color. The spatial arrangement of the colors within the rectangle in the input is preserved in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
