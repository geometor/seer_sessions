Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into a smaller grid. The input grids consistently have a large blue (1) region. It seems the non-blue pixels at the edges are very important. The output grid is much smaller and appears to only include the non-blue, non-white, and non-azure colors from the corners/edges, and only the colors that appear at the top/bottom, not the sides. The output appears to arrange these colors in a specific layout, possibly related to original spatial positions. White and Azure pixels are not in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain a large central area of blue (1) pixels.
  - observation: Non-blue pixels exist primarily on the edges of the input grid.
  - observation: The output grid only contains a subset of colors from the input grid.
  - observation: Colors blue (1), white (0) and azure (8) in the input grid do not appear in the output.
  - observation: The arrangement in the output grid appears positional. top edge input stacked above bottom edge. Left and right edge colors do not appear.
  - object_type: Grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - actions:
    - select_colors: Selects specific colors from the input grid based on position and excluding 1, 0, and 8.
    - arrange: Arranges selected colors into a smaller output grid, maintaining relative positions.
  - spatial_relationship: Colors in output grid are arranged according to relative positions and rows
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Examine the top and bottom rows of the input grid. Identify all colors *except* blue (1), white (0), and azure (8).

2.  **Extract Top Row Colors:** From the top row, extract the identified non-blue, non-white, and non-azure colors *in their original order*.

3.  **Extract Bottom Row Colors:** From the bottom row, extract the identified non-blue, non-white and non-azure colors *in their original order*.

4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid.
  - Place the extracted top row colors in the first row(s) of a new grid. If there aren't enough, pad with white (0).
  - Place the extracted bottom row colors in the row(s) below the top row colors, starting at the same column index as their appearance in the original bottom row. If there aren't enough, pad with white (0).

In the observed examples:
The output grid appears to be constructed with the colors arranged, from left-to-right, by the original column position.
If a color appears twice on an edge (top or bottom) then it appears twice in the output.
The top edge input colors appear stacked above the bottom edge input colors.
