objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [8, 8] # Input grid dimensions
      - cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [4, 4] # Output grid dimensions
      - cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors
    role: output

  - type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: varied
      - shape: irregular
      - description: contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid.
    role: potential_input_feature

actions:
  - type: dimensionality_reduction
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.
  - type: feature_extraction
    description: Specific color/pixel information from the input is selected and placed in the output grid. Specifically, some type of corner detection

relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
  - object_mapping:  It appears each non-zero value in output corresponds to the corners of 'objects' in the input, preserving the original color.
