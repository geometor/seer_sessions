Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is down-sampled to create a smaller output grid. Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 subgrids. The precise rule by which the output is sampled is task-dependent:

*   In some tasks, the value of the pixel at the top-left corner of each 2x2 subgrid is assigned to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
*   In other tasks, pixels are selected based on a specific pattern, potentially skipping columns or rows at specific intervals, determined by visual inspection of the input-output examples.

The general rule is that a 2x2 input is reduced to a single pixel in the output, the precise location depends on the example.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
