task_description: |
  The task involves identifying distinct contiguous objects within a 2D grid and then representing these objects in a new 1D grid. The representation is based on the color of the top-left pixel of each object, and the objects are ordered from left to right based on their top-left pixel's horizontal position.
objects:
  - definition: Contiguous regions of non-zero pixels of the same color.
  - properties:
      top_left_corner: The pixel with the smallest row and column indices within the object.
      color: The color value of the pixels forming the object.
      horizontal_position: The column index of the top-left corner.
actions:
  - identify: Locate all distinct objects in the input grid.
  - extract_color: Determine the color of the top-left corner of each object.
  - sort: Order the objects based on the horizontal position of their top-left corners.
  - represent: Create a 1D output grid where each element represents an object's top-left corner color, ordered by horizontal position.
