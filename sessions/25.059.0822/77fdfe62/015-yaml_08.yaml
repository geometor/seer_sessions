objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)

observations:
  - The input grid is divided into sixteen 2x2 subgrids.
  - Each 2x2 subgrid in the input grid corresponds to a single pixel in the output_grid.
  - output_grid[0,0] derives its value (6) from the top-left corner pixel from the top left 2x2 block of the input grid, input_grid[0,0].
  - output_grid[0,1] derives its value from pixel[0,6] from the 2x2 block input_grid[0:2, 6:8]
  - output_grid[0,2] comes from pixel[0,7]
  - output_grid[0,3] comes from pixel[0,1]
  - output_grid[1,0] comes from pixel[0,0]
  - output_grid[1,1] comes from pixel[0,1]
  - output_grid[1,2] comes from pixel[0,6]
  - output_grid[1,3] comes from pixel[0,7]
  - output_grid[2,0] comes from pixel[7,0]
  - output_grid[2,1] comes from pixel[7,1]
  - output_grid[2,2] comes from pixel[7,6]
  - output_grid[2,3] comes from pixel[7,7]
  - output_grid[3,0] comes from pixel[7,0]
  - output_grid[3,1] comes from pixel[7,1]
  - output_grid[3,2] comes from pixel[7,6]
  - output_grid[3,3] comes from pixel[7,7]
  - the top-left pixel of each block

  - The output grid appears to extract specific colors from the corners of four 4x4 blocks in the input_grid
relationships:
  - spatial_mapping: input_grid (2x2 subgrids) -> output_grid (single pixels)

actions:
  - selection: Specific pixels from the input grid appear to determine the output_grid.
