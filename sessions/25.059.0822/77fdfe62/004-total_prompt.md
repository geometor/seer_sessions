Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a larger, more detailed grid (input) into a smaller, coarser grid (output). The input grid appears to contain several distinct objects, identifiable by color (represented by different digits). The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of the input, retaining only certain key features or a summary of the original objects. The transformation involves a reduction in both size and detail. It appears that only the corner pixels are somehow extracted.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [8, 8] # Input grid dimensions
      - cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [4, 4] # Output grid dimensions
      - cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors
    role: output

  - type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: varied
      - shape: irregular
      - description: contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid.
    role: potential_input_feature

actions:
  - type: dimensionality_reduction
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.
  - type: feature_extraction
    description: Specific color/pixel information from the input is selected and placed in the output grid. Specifically, some type of corner detection

relationships:
  - input_output: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
  - object_mapping:  It appears each non-zero value in output corresponds to the corners of 'objects' in the input, preserving the original color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, identify distinct "objects" formed by contiguous regions of the same color.

2.  **Detect Object Corners**: For each object, locate its corner pixels.

3. **Construct Output Grid**: The grid will be smaller than the input, in this example, the size shrinks by half along the two axes.

4.  **Populate Output:** Place the color value of the input corner pixels into the output grid. The placement depends on the position of the corner within each object and the object's relative position to the borders of the input grid. Specifically:
    *   Top-left corner pixels of objects go in the top-left quadrant of output.
    *   Top-right corner pixels in top-right.
    *   Bottom-left in bottom-left.
    *   Bottom-right in bottom-right.
    *   The positioning appears to maintain relative positioning within each quadrant.
    *   Empty (white, 0) parts of the input result in an empty output quadrant.

5.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
