The primary element is the presence of colored objects (contiguous blocks of the same non-zero color) within the grid. The transformation appears to involve replicating and repositioning these objects, specifically along a diagonal extending downwards from their original position. The size and shape of the objects are seemingly preserved during replication. The background (cells with value 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
