This is the \"yellow object.\"\n\n2.  **Translate** the yellow object diagonally downwards and to the right. The amount of shift is the minimum needed to achieve a repeating pattern.\n\n3.  **Replicate** the resulting translated component to the edge of the grid in a pattern of down and to the right. The translation continues, adding a yellow pixel diagonally down and to the right for the rows that follow the last row that contains a yellow pixel.\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes a connected \"blob\" of yellow pixels and shifts it to be repeated to the grid edge.\n"
