Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The primary color present is orange (7) against a background of white (0).
*   The orange pixels in the input form a somewhat connected shape, while in the output, the shape is expanded and rotated.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      background_color: 0  # White
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 7  # Orange
      initial_position:
        row_min: 2
        row_max: 5
        col_min: 3
        col_max: 6
    actions:
      - type: expand
        details: "Expands around the core 2x2 square of orange."
      - type: rotate
        details: "Rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the contiguous orange (7) pixels in the input grid. There appears to be an identifiable 2x2 square of '7's.
2.  **Expand:** If there is an isolated orange region, a copy is translated.
3. **Rotate:** The copied orange region rotates by 90 degrees counter-clockwise relative to the 2x2 orange block.
