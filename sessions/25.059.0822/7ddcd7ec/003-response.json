The transformation seems to involve extending the green pixels diagonally downwards and to the right. The initial green pixels form a 2x2 square and a single isolated pixel. The transformation creates a diagonal line of green pixels originating from each initial green pixel, extending to the bottom-right edge of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
