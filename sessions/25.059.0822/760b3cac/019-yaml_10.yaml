    description: |
      The bounding box of *each* contiguous azure region is determined.
      Pixels within this bounding box are changed to azure, *unless* they are yellow.
      Yellow pixels are always preserved.
    constraints:
      - only applies to azure regions
      - preserves yellow pixels
