Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial `transform` function to the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved moving azure pixels to the top row. The subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The core concept of moving azure pixels to the top is correct, but the handling of other colors and empty spaces needs adjustment. The initial assumption that the output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid, and other pixels were preserved is NOT correct. Instead, pixels that are NOT azure are set to black/0, except when the azure pixels are moved to the top.

Here's the refined strategy:

1.  **Focus on Azure Pixels:** The primary action is still moving azure pixels to the top row.
2.  **Output Initialization**: Initialize the output as all black/0.
3.  **Preserve Empty Spaces**: The original locations from where the Azure Pixels get moved are reset to 0/black.
4. **Yellow Pixels**: Yellow pixels do not have any special behavior, they are cleared like all the other non-azure pixels.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a clearer picture, let's examine each example pair and the result of the current `transform` function.

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_grid):
    """
    Executes code and documents differences.
    Focus on location and color of differences.

    Args:
        input_grid:  The original input grid.
        output_grid: The expected output grid.
        transformed_grid: The output from the current transform function.

    Returns:
        A string describing the discrepancies.
    """

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    transformed_grid = np.array(transformed_grid)

    report = []
    if not np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid):
        diff_indices = np.where(output_grid != transformed_grid)
        for r, c in zip(*diff_indices):
            report.append(
                f"Row: {r}, Col: {c}, Expected: {output_grid[r, c]}, Got: {transformed_grid[r, c]}"
            )
        if len(report) == 0:
            report.append("Output and Transformed are the same size, but pixel values differ in areas beyond simple row/col comparison")

    else:
      report.append("output_grid and transformed_grid are identical.")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    behavior: move_to_top

  - name: other_pixels
    color: not_azure
    behavior: become_black

actions:
  - name: move_to_top
    description: All azure pixels are moved to the first row of the output grid.
    precedence: 1

  - name: become_black
    description: All non-azure pixels in the input become black in the output.
    precedence: 2
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid filled entirely with black (0) pixels, with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Identify and Move:** Find all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Fill First Row:** Place the azure pixels in the first row of the output grid, starting from the leftmost column.  If there are more azure pixels than columns, only fill up to the grid width.
4. **Clear Non-Azure**: All the other non-azure colors in the Input Grid become 0/Black in the Output grid.

This revised program accounts for the observed behavior across all training examples. It correctly handles the movement of azure pixels and the blanking out of all other pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
