Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The grids appear to be of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). The azure and yellow regions appear to form distinct shapes. The transformation seems to specifically affect the azure (8) regions, while the yellow (4) region remains unchanged. The change in the azure region appears to be based on its shape and possibly its position within the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Copy it directly.\n3.  **Azure Transformation:** Examine the azure (8) shape.\n    *   If an azure pixel has azure neighbors both above/below and left/right (a \"cross\" shape), fill that azure with a '0'.\n    *   If an azure does not have neighbors in all 4 directions, keep its value.\n4. **Output Construction:** Create the output grid by copying the transformed azure shape, and the original position of yellow shape.\n\nIn simpler terms, the rule seems to be: Preserve the yellow shape. For the azure shape, \"outline\" the shape by keeping the edges and making azure pixels within the shape into white (0). An \"edge\" here is determined by pixels that don't have neighbors on all 4 sides (up, down, left, right).\n"
