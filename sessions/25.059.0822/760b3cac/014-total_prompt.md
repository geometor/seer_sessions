Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8), yellow (4), and black (0) pixels.

2.  **Azure Expansion:** Starting from any azure (8) pixel, iteratively expand the azure color to all adjacent black (0) pixels. Continue this expansion until no more black (0) pixels are adjacent to any azure (8) pixel. This is a "flood fill" operation.

3.  **Yellow Preservation:** The yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged throughout the process. They act as boundaries for the azure expansion.

4. **Black background:** The black (0) pixels are replaced by the expanding azure.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the flood fill implementation and refine our natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code focused on a simple flood-fill operation, starting from an azure pixel and expanding into black pixels, while respecting yellow pixels as boundaries.  The test results indicate this works perfectly for the first example, but fails completely on the second and third. This suggests that the initial rule, while correct for one case, is not the general rule governing the transformation.  We need to revisit the core assumptions.  The consistent failure suggests there's a fundamental element of the transformation we've missed, rather than a minor adjustment needed. It's likely not a simple flood fill at all.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** We need to look closely at *all* examples again, seeking common patterns and relationships between the input and output that the flood-fill missed. We must consider alternative operations besides flood fill.
2.  **Object Identification:** Carefully list all objects (contiguous regions of the same color) in both input and output grids for each example. Pay close attention to their shapes, positions, and relationships to each other.
3.  **Hypothesize Alternative Transformations:**  Based on the object analysis, propose different transformations.  Consider mirroring, rotation, copying, or more complex shape manipulations, not just flood fill.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the new hypotheses.

**Metrics and Observations (via Manual Inspection and confirmed with future code execution)**

| Example | Input Summary                      | Output Summary                                      | Result    | Notes                                                                      |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Azure (8), Black (0), Yellow (4)   | Expanded Azure (8) replacing Black (0)            | Correct   | Flood fill works as expected.                                             |
| 2       | Azure (8), Black (0), Yellow (4)   | Azure (8) replaces specific area of Black.       | Incorrect | Flood fill doesn't explain the limited, specific shape of the azure region. |
| 3       | Azure (8), Black (0), Yellow (4)   |  Azure (8) fills a specific area of Black (0)      | Incorrect | Similar to example 2, flood fill fails to capture the specific output shape. |

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the azure (8) pixel and the yellow (4) pixels. The remaining pixels are black (0).
2.  **Azure Expansion:** The azure (8) expands *one unit* to the left, right, and down, replacing black pixels.
3. **Yellow Preservation:** The yellow pixels remain unchanged.

The critical difference from the previous program is the *limited* expansion of the azure – only one step in each of the three specified directions (left, right, and down). It is *not* a flood fill.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
