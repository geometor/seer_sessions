            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on the azure (8) color and its expansion. However, the code only considered downward and rightward expansion. The provided examples clearly show that the expansion of the azure color is more comprehensive, filling in all adjacent '0's, effectively \"flooding\" or \"filling\" contiguous regions of zeros that are connected to the initial azure shape. The yellow shape remains constant, acting as a boundary in examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Expansion Logic:** The core issue is the limited expansion. Instead of only expanding down and right, we need to implement a \"flood fill\" type of expansion. This means that any '0' adjacent to an '8' should become an '8', and this process should continue iteratively until no more '0's adjacent to '8's are found.\n\n2.  **Preserve Yellow Shape:** The current implementation correctly leaves yellow (4) unchanged.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output and the actual output of the previous code.\n\n**Example 1**\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]]\nExpected Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]]\nActual Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 4 4 0 0 0 8 0]]\nResult: Pass\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]]\nExpected Output:\n[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 4 4 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 4 4 8 8 8 8 8]\n [8 4 4 8 8 8 8 8]]\nActual Output:\n[[8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]]\nResult: Fail\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]]\nExpected Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]]\nActual Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]\n [0 0 0 0 0 4 4 8]]\nResult: Pass\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: azure (8)\n    behavior: expands to fill adjacent '0' cells\n    initial_shape: variable, defined in input\n    final_shape: expanded, bounded by other colors or grid edges\n  - color: yellow (4)\n    behavior: static, does not change\n    initial_shape: variable, defined in input\n    final_shape: identical to initial shape\n  - color: black (0)\n    behavior: passive, replaced by azure (8) during expansion\n    initial_shape: background and gaps\n    final_shape: reduced, only areas not reached by azure expansion\n\nactions:\n  - name: flood_fill_expansion\n    agent: azure (8)\n    target: black (0)\n    condition: adjacency\n    result: replace '0' with '8'\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8), yellow (4), and black (0) pixels.\n\n2.  **Azure Expansion:** Starting from any azure (8) pixel, iteratively expand the azure color to all adjacent black (0) pixels. Continue this expansion until no more black (0) pixels are adjacent to any azure (8) pixel. This is a \"flood fill\" operation.\n\n3.  **Yellow Preservation:** The yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged throughout the process. They act as boundaries for the azure expansion.\n\n4. **Black background:** The black (0) pixels are replaced by the expanding azure.\n\nThe key improvement is the concept of \"iterative expansion\" or \"flood fill,\" which accurately captures the transformation's behavior. The yellow object's role as a static boundary is also clarified.\n"
