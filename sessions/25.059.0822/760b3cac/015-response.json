Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There's a clear alteration in the arrangement of the azure (8) pixels between the input and output, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. The azure pixels appear to be 'moving' or being 'redrawn' based on some rule related to their original positions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
