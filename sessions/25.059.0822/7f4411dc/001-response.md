Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer representing a color. The transformation seems to selectively remove certain colored objects/pixels based on some criteria. The core elements appear to be:

*   **Objects:** Contiguous regions of pixels of the same color.
*   **Colors:** Each digit (0-9) represents a distinct color.
*   **Background:** The color '0' (white) seems to act as the background.
*   **Selection/Removal:** Some objects are removed in the output, while others are retained. The selection criteria are not immediately obvious but is the key.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: 2D grid
    description: Input and output are grids of digits representing colors.
  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous regions of the same color.
  - type: colors
    description: Digits 0-9 represent different colors, with 0 being the background (white).
  - type: transformation
    description: Selective removal of colored objects.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 7 (orange)
          description: Several disconnected orange objects, varying in size and shape.
      output_objects:
        - color: 7 (orange)
          description: Some orange objects are removed, particularly those on isolated single pixels.
      changes: Isolated single pixel objects and single pixels along edges of larger orange objects are removed.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          description: Several disconnected magenta objects, varying in size and shape.
      output_objects:
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          description: some magenta objects are removed.
      changes:  Isolated single pixels of color 6 are removed.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
          - color: 5 (gray)
            description: several grey objects, including single pixels and larger rectangular shapes.
      output_objects:
          - color: 5 (gray)
            description: Some gray objects are removed.
      changes: Isolated single pixel objects, as well as the objects that are not part of larger groups of pixels are removed.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct objects. An object is a group of one or more adjacent pixels of the same color. Adjacency includes both side-by-side and diagonal connections.
2.  **Filter Objects:** Iterate through the identified objects.
    *   If an object consists of a single pixel, remove it (set its value to 0).
    *.  If an object has a shape other than a single isolated pixel, keep all object pixels that are direct neighbors.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by setting removed object pixels to 0 (the background color), and preserving the remaining object pixels with their original colors.

Essentially, the rule appears to be: **Remove all single-pixel objects of any color, and keep all objects made of multiple connected pixels.** This maintains objects with more than one pixel, while isolated pixels disappear.
