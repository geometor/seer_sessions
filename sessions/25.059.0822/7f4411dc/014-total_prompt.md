Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Magenta Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color magenta (6) in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Isolated Corner Pixel:** If a magenta pixel is located at the extreme top-right corner of the grid, preserve this magenta pixel.

3. **Preserve Edge Pixel** If a magenta pixel exists in the middle of the left edge of the grid (row = height/2, where height equals number of rows - 1, and column = 0) , preserve it

4. **Preserve larger contiguous blocks:** Identify contiguous blocks of magenta pixels (where pixels are directly adjacent horizontally or vertically). If a contiguous block contains more than two magenta pixels, preserve all pixels within that block.

5.  **Preserve Grid of 4:** If magenta pixels form a 2x2 grid anywhere on the canvas, they are preserved

6.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid should be white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying and preserving magenta pixels based on specific conditions: isolated corner pixels, edge pixels, 2x2 grids, and contiguous blocks larger than two pixels. The tests reveal that the current logic is partially correct but needs adjustments. The main discrepancies appear to stem from an incomplete understanding of the conditions under which magenta pixels are preserved or removed. The "contiguous block" rule needs to be reviewed, as well as the 2x2, edge, and corner preservation rules. The strategy is to examine each example where the output is incorrect, pinpoint the exact pixels that differ, and infer the correct rules from these discrepancies.

**Example and Results Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the expected output, the actual output from the code, and an analysis:

    for r in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[r, c] != grid2[r, c]:

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: magenta (6)
    description: Target pixels for the transformation.
    properties:
      - contiguous: Can form connected groups.
      - isolated: Can exist as single pixels.
      - edge: Can be located on the edges of the grid.
      - corner: Can be located at grid corners

actions:
  - identify: Locate magenta pixels.
  - preserve: Keep magenta pixels based on specific conditions.
  - clear: Set non-magenta pixels to white (0).

conditions:
  - size: The size of the magenta pixel configuration
  - position: location relative to grid
```

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Magenta Pixels:** Find all pixels colored magenta (6) in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Contiguous Blocks:** If magenta pixels form a contiguous block (horizontally or vertically adjacent) of *any* size, preserve all pixels within that block.

3.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels (non-magenta) in the output grid should be white (0).

The key change is removing conditions for the "corner", "edge", and "2x2"
cases. If a magenta pixel exists, check for a contiguous block - if it exists,
preserve the pixels, otherwise clear them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
