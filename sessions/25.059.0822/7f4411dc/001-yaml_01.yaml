task_elements:
  - type: 2D grid
    description: Input and output are grids of digits representing colors.
  - type: objects
    description: Contiguous regions of the same color.
  - type: colors
    description: Digits 0-9 represent different colors, with 0 being the background (white).
  - type: transformation
    description: Selective removal of colored objects.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 7 (orange)
          description: Several disconnected orange objects, varying in size and shape.
      output_objects:
        - color: 7 (orange)
          description: Some orange objects are removed, particularly those on isolated single pixels.
      changes: Isolated single pixel objects and single pixels along edges of larger orange objects are removed.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          description: Several disconnected magenta objects, varying in size and shape.
      output_objects:
        - color: 6 (magenta)
          description: some magenta objects are removed.
      changes:  Isolated single pixels of color 6 are removed.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
          - color: 5 (gray)
            description: several grey objects, including single pixels and larger rectangular shapes.
      output_objects:
          - color: 5 (gray)
            description: Some gray objects are removed.
      changes: Isolated single pixel objects, as well as the objects that are not part of larger groups of pixels are removed.
