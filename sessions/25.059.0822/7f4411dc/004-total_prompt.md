Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the perceived transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 13x13 grids.
*   **Colors:** Primarily two colors are present: white (0) and orange (7).
*   **Objects:** Clusters of orange (7) pixels form contiguous shapes, which can be considered "objects". Some are single pixels and others larger connected blocks.
*    The output grid appears to be the same as input with some of the orange pixels changing to white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: color_change
objects:
  - id: orange_pixels
    color: orange (7)
    description: Appear as individual pixels or contiguous groups.
  - id: white_pixels
    color: white (0)
    description: Background and also result of transformation
actions:
  - name: remove_orange
    agent: system
    target: orange_pixels
    condition: "orange pixel is adjacent to at least one white pixel, and the orange pixel is part of a contiguous group that is 3 or greater in any one direction."
    result: change the value(color) of orange pixel to a white pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Apply Removal Rule:** Iterate through each orange pixels.
3.  **Conditional Removal**: If an orange pixel is adjacent to at least one white pixel, AND it's a part of a shape that is 3 or greater in size in any on direction (vertical/horizontal/diagnal), change that pixel to white (0).
4. **No change**: If an orange shape is not adjacent to any white pixel, that orange object stays. If an orange pixel is only connected to one or two other orange pixels, those stay.
5.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid.

In simple terms, the transformation removes the "orange" shapes if they are adjacent to a "white" pixel and part of a larger "orange" object. It preserves a smaller orange pixel (1x1) only if there are no adjecent white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
