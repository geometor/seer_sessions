Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of changing adjacent white pixels to yellow around red sequences. However, the provided results reveal a flaw in the logic: the code doesn't fully capture the "propagation" or "filling" aspect of the transformation. It only changes directly adjacent white pixels, but the examples show that the yellow color should extend to *all connected* white pixels, not just those immediately touching the red.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

The primary issue is that the code only considers immediate neighbors. We need to implement a flood-fill or connected-component labeling algorithm. When an adjacent white pixel is found, it should be turned yellow, and then *its* adjacent white pixels should also be checked, and so on, until no more connected white pixels are found.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

To gather metrics, I will use manual inspection, since I do not have code execution capabilties, I need to examine each input/output pair. I'll describe discrepancies.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Single red pixel with surrounding white pixels.
    *   Expected Output: All surrounding white pixels become yellow.
    *   Actual Output: Only the immediate neighbors of the red pixel turned yellow.
    *   **Discrepancy:** Demonstrates the need for flood-fill.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two separate red regions, each surrounded by white.
    *   Expected Output: White regions around each red region are filled with yellow.
    *   Actual Output: Only immediate neighbors of the red regions turned yellow.
    *   **Discrepancy:** Again, highlights the need for flood-fill. It also confirms that the rule applies independently to distinct red regions.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Red lines along with other non-white and non-red colors
    *   Expected Output: all white cells connected with the red cells are changed to yellow
    *   Actual output: Only immediate neighbors of the red regions turned yellow.
    *   **Discrepancy:** the propagation to all connected white cells is not performed

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, yellow, ...]  # Represented by integers 0-9

  - type: red_region
    description: One or more contiguous red pixels.
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - connectivity: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected

  - type: white_region
    description: One or more contiguous white pixels, connected to a red_region.
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - connectivity: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected

actions:
  - name: flood_fill
    description: Changes the color of a connected white_region to yellow.
    trigger: The white_region is adjacent to a red_region.
    parameters:
      - target_color: white
      - replacement_color: yellow
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Find all contiguous groups of red (2) pixels in the input grid.  These can be single pixels or larger connected shapes.
2.  **For Each Red Region:**
    *   **Find Connected White Regions:** Identify all white (0) pixels that are directly *or indirectly* connected to the red region.  Connectivity includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency. This forms a "white region" connected to the "red region".
    *   **Flood Fill:** Change the color of all pixels within the connected white region to yellow (4). This is a recursive process:
        *   Start with white pixels directly adjacent to the red region.
        *   For each newly colored yellow pixel, check its neighbors.
        *   Continue until no more connected white pixels are found.
3. **Repeat:** Perform steps 2.1 and 2.2 for *each* distinct red region found in the grid.
4.  **Output:** The resulting grid, with white regions adjacent to red regions now filled with yellow, is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
