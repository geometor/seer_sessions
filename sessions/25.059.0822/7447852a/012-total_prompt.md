Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal discrepancies. The core idea of identifying red pixels and changing some to yellow based on their proximity to white pixels seems partially correct. However, the propagation rule (yellow color moving down) and the conditions for changing red to yellow need adjustments.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each input-output pair where the current code fails. Identify the specific pixels that are different and try to understand *why* the code produces the wrong result. Use code to help report on the issues.
2.  **Refine Conditions:** Based on the discrepancies, modify the conditions for changing red pixels to yellow. Consider factors like the relative position of *all* red pixels in a row and their positioning in groups, not just the first one.
3.  **Adjust Propagation:** Revisit the rule for propagating the yellow color. The current rule of simply moving it down one row is likely too simplistic. The final propagation logic is that the yellow color extends downward *if and only if* the cell immediately below is not red (value 2)
4.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the natural language program and, subsequently, the code, re-test on *all* training examples to ensure consistency.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

```python
import numpy as np

def get_red_pixels(grid):
    # use where to find red pixels
    red_pixels = np.where(grid == 2)
    # combine and return list of (row, col)
    return list(zip(red_pixels[0], red_pixels[1]))
    
def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and returns the coordinates of differing pixels."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Grids have different shapes"

    diff_pixels = []
    for row in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for col in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[row, col] != grid2[row, col]:
                diff_pixels.append((row, col, int(grid1[row, col]), int(grid2[row, col])))
    return diff_pixels

```
Example 3:

*   Predicted Output vs. Expected Output: One difference at (2, 9). Expected is 4, predicted is 0. This indicates that the yellow propagation did not occur when a 2 was present

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    action: change color to yellow based on position
  - name: yellow_pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    action: propagate downwards conditionally
  - name: white_pixel
      color: white(0)

actions:
  - name: find_red_pixels
    description: Identify all red pixels in the grid.
  - name: evaluate_red_group
    description: Evaluate each group of adjacent red pixels
  - name: modify_red_to_yellow
    description: Change some red pixels to yellow based on contiguity and position in groups. The last red pixel in each contiguous group of red pixels on a row becomes yellow.
  - name: propagate_yellow
    description:  Extend yellow color downwards if cell below is not red.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 2 (red) within the input grid.
2.  **Group Red Pixels:** Group the red pixels in each row by their horizontal adjacency.
3. **Transform last Red to Yellow**: In each horizontal group of red pixels, change only the *last* red pixel to yellow (4).
4.  **Propagate Yellow Downward:** For every yellow pixel, change the pixel directly below it to yellow, *unless* the pixel below is red (2). If the cell below is red the propagation stops for that column.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
