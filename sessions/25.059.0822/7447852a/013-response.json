The primary colors observed are red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The input grid appears to have a repeating pattern of red and white pixels. The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some white pixels to yellow based on their position relative to the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
