Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The input grid appears to have a repeating pattern of red and white pixels. The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some white pixels to yellow based on their position relative to the red pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [red, white, yellow]
      position: [row, column]
actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    target: pixel
    precondition:
      - target.color == white
      - adjacent pixels have specific colors
    postcondition:
      - target.color == yellow
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    properties:
      direction: [horizontal, vertical, diagonal]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2).
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** For each row, iterate through the pixels from left to right.
3.  **Conditional Color Change:**
    *   If a white pixel (0) is encountered and is horizontally between two red pixels, change its color to yellow.
    *   If a red pixel is encountered and if is horizontally between white and yellow or yellow and white, change its color to yellow.
4. **Vertical Scan** For each column, iterate through the pixels from top to bottom.
5. **Conditional Color Change:**
        *    If a white pixel is encountered and is vertically between two red pixels change its color to yellow.
        *    If a red pixel is encountered and if is vertically between white and yellow or yellow and white, change its color to yellow.
6. The locations of the yellow pixels in relation to the red suggests the transformation rule may be related to identifying the white pixels surrounded on two sides by the red pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
