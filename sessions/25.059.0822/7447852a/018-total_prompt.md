Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify White and Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels that are white (value 0) and red (value 2).
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
3.  **Horizontal Betweenness:** If a white pixel is found, check if it has a red pixel immediately to its left AND a red pixel immediately to its right. If so, change the white pixel to yellow (value 4).
4.  **Vertical Scan:** Iterate through each column of the grid.
5.  **Vertical Betweenness:** If a white pixel is found, check if it has a red pixel immediately above it AND a red pixel immediately below it. If so, change the white pixel to yellow (value 4).
6.  **Ignore Other Cases:** Do not consider diagonal relationships or change any colors from red to any other color, given these conditions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a "betweenness" rule, changing white pixels to yellow if they are horizontally or vertically sandwiched between two red pixels. The test results indicate that this rule is generally correct, capturing the essence of the transformation in multiple examples. However, a closer look is necessary to ensure all nuances are covered. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify Correct Transformations:** Confirm that the successfully transformed examples indeed follow the stated rule, building confidence in its core logic.
2.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** For examples with differences, pinpoint the exact locations where the output deviates from the expected result. This will highlight edge cases or additional conditions not yet captured by the program.
3.  **Refine the Program:** Based on the analysis, adjust the natural language program to incorporate the missing elements or correct any misinterpretations.
4. Use code execution to provide metrics.

**Metrics and Observations**

To accurately assess the performance, I need to know specifics of each example. I need to know the shapes of the inputs and outputs, and I need to perform a pixel by pixel comparison of the `transform` function's output to the expected output for each example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
