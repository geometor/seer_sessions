facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels.
  - observation: Input grids contain distinct colored regions above and below the azure line.
  - observation: Output grids maintain the colors of the distinct regions from the input.
  - observation: Output grids reduce each distinct colored region to a 2x2 block, or to 2 in line if next to grid border.
  - observation: the position relative to each other and border of distinct regions is maintained.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are smaller and seemingly related to the number of distinct colored regions in the input.
