The mapping to `5` appears more common and takes precedence.\n    * The column index is preserved during this transformation if the input column index is < 6\n    * The row index is preserved during this transformation if the input row index < 6.\n\n4.  **Other Colors:**\n    * Colors, other than `3` and `8` are not consistently preserved in the output. Colors `1`, `2`, `4`, `5`, `6`, and `7` seem to disappear or are not directly mapped using a simple rule.\n\n5. **Object-Based Logic:**  The transformation seems to prioritize preserving the *existence* of certain objects, rather than strictly preserving their positions:\n    * The vertical line of azure gets \"summarized\" by the red and yellow pixels.\n    * The existence of green seems to create gray or magenta in output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_positions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of (row, col) tuples representing the positions of a given color in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [(row, col) for row in range(grid.shape[0]) for col in range(grid.shape[1]) if grid[row, col] == color]\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=int)\n\n    # Check for the presence of azure (8)\n    azure_positions = get_positions(input_grid, 8)\n    if azure_positions:\n        output_grid[0, 0] = 2  # First column, first row: Red (2)\n        output_grid[0, 5] = 4  # Last column, first row: Yellow (4)\n\n    # Handle Green (3) to Gray (5) or Magenta (6) mapping\n    green_positions = get_positions(input_grid, 3)\n    for row, col in green_positions:\n        if row < 6 and col < 6:\n            output_grid[row, col] = 5  # Default to Gray (5)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
