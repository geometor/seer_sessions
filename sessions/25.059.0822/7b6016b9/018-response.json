Contiguous means orthogonally connected (up, down, left, right - not diagonal).\n3. Preserve Yellow Objects: Copy all yellow (4) pixels from the input to the output.\n4. Interior Fill: For *each* green (3) pixel in the output, determine if it lies *inside* any of the yellow objects. If it does, change it to red (2). A pixel is considered \"inside\" a yellow object if it is not part of the object and requires crossing the object to reach the edge of the grid.\n5.
