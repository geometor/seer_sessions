The output grid maintains the same shape and dimensions but introduces two new colors: 3 (green) and 2 (red). The yellow 4s in the input are largely preserved in the output, though some are replaced. Green (3) appears to \"outline\" or \"fill\" the background. Red (2) seems to fill the interior spaces within the \"W\" shape, which may not be perfect.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
