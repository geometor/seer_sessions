Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid consists primarily of 0s (white) with a pattern of 4s (yellow) forming what looks like the letter "W". The output grid maintains the same shape and dimensions but introduces two new colors: 3 (green) and 2 (red). The yellow 4s in the input are largely preserved in the output, though some are replaced. Green (3) appears to "outline" or "fill" the background. Red (2) seems to fill the interior spaces within the "W" shape, which may not be perfect.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: 0 (white)
    role: background
  - id: W_shape
    color: 4 (yellow)
    description: A shape resembling the letter "W"
  - id: outline
    color: 3 (green)
    description: fills the entire background
  - id: interior_fill
    color: 2 (red)
    description: Fills the enclosed spaces within the 'W' shape.

actions:
  - name: fill_background
    object: background
    new_color: 3 (green)
  - name: preserve_shape
    object: W_shape
   # new_color: 4 (yellow)
  - name: fill_interior
    object: interior_fill
    new_color: 2 (red)

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: background
    to: W_shape
  - type: surrounds
    from: outline
    to: W_shape
  - type: inside
    from: interior_fill
    to: W_shape
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Fill the background:** Change all pixels with the value 0 (white) in the input to 3 (green) in the output.
2.  **Preserve Outer Shape:** Keep most of the yellow (4) pixels that form the outer "W" shape.
3.  **Fill Interior:** Change all the green (3) pixels, that are *inside* the "W" to 2 (red). Inside is up, down, left, right, no diagonals.

Essentially, the transformation creates a colored "W" with a different color inside and outside of the main shape.
