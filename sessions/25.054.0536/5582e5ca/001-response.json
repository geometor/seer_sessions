The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color. The key seems to lie in identifying a dominant or specific color within the input. In this specific example, the color '4' (yellow) appears to be the most frequent, or perhaps has a specific location/property, and is used to fill the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
