facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains multiple colors.
  - observation: |
      Each output grid contains only one color, matching one of the colors from the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The dimensions (height and width) of the input and output grids are identical.
  - rule: |
      The output grid is filled entirely with the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - height: int (number of rows)
      - width: int (number of columns)
      - unique_colors: list[int] (all colors present in the grid)
