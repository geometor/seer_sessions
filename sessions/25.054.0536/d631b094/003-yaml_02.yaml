facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of different colors, represented by integers 0-9.
      Black (0) seems to be the background color.
  - object: non_zero_pixels
    description: |
        Pixels in the input grid that are not black (0).
    properties:
      color: |
        The color of the non-zero pixel.  This varies across examples.
      count: |
          The number of times the non-zero color appears in the input grid.
  - action: count_and_replicate
    description: |
      Counts the number of non-zero pixels of a specific color and creates a 1xN output grid.
    input: non_zero_pixels
    output: output_grid
    parameters:
      color: |
        The non-zero color to be counted and replicated.
      count: |
          The number of times the color appears in the input (and the width of the output).
  - context: |
      The transformation identifies a single non-black color in the input grid, counts its occurrences, and generates a 1xN output grid filled with that color.
