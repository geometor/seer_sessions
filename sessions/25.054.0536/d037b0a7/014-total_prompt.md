## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A517B7C0>

**output:**
```
4 0 0
4 2 0
4 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A502F160>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains three colors: yellow (4), red (2), and white (0). The output grid maintains the same dimensions and grid structure. The positions of the white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The yellow (4) pixel in the top-left corner expands downwards, replacing the white pixels below it. The red (2) pixel in the center stays but is copied down once

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - yellow (4)
        - red (2)
        - white (0)
      position: (row, column)
  - action: copy_down
    parameters:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - direction: downwards
    conditions: original_position = (0,0)
    result: replace pixels below with copies of color

  - action: copy_down
    parameters:
      - color: red(2)
      - direction: downwards
    conditions: original_position = (1,1)
    result: replace pixels below with copies of color

  - action: stay
    parameters:
      -color: white(0)
    result: all white pixels remain unchanged

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the yellow pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) and the red pixel at the center (1,1) and all the white pixels.
2.  **Yellow Expansion:** Copy the yellow pixel downwards, replacing all the pixels until the end of the column, inclusive.
3. **Red stays in place:** The red pixel at (1,1) doesn't change.
4. **Copy Red below:** The red pixel at (1,1) is copied in the pixels below it.
5.  **Preserve Whites:** All white pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
