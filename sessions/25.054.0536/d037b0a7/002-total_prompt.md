## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A4F472E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A4F478E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve propagating or filling certain colors based on others. Specifically, it appears the color represented by '6' (magenta) is expanding or filling the grid based on some rule related to the positions of other colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: colors
  - object: color_6
    initial_location: [0,2] #row, col
    property: dominant_color
    action: expands
  - object: color_4
    initial_location: [1,1]
    property: secondary_color
  - object: color_3
    initial_location: [2,0]
    property: static_color
  - relationship: color_6 expands to fill cells adjacent to itself and color_4

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors**: Locate the initial positions of colors '6' (magenta), '4' (yellow), and '3' (green).
2.  **Expansion Rule**: Color '6' expands to fill any cell that is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to an existing cell of color '6'.
3. **Secondary expansion**: Color 6 expands to fill any cell adjacent to color '4'.
4.  **Fill Priority:** If a cell is adjacent to color '3', color '3' does not get replaced.
5. **Result**: Apply the rule to generate final grid

Essentially color 6, the dominant color fills cells which are next to the dominant color.
Color '4' acts as secondary source.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
