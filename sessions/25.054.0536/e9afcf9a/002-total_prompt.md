## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7D20A457F4F0>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7D20A457F8B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in a checkerboard pattern. The dimensions of the grid seem to remain constant (at least in this example).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid has two rows.
  - observation: Input grid's first row is all green (3).
  - observation: Input grid's second row is all maroon (9).
  - observation: Output grid has two rows.
  - observation: Output grid has alternating green (3) and maroon (9) pixels.
  - observation: Output grid's first row starts with green (3).
  - observation: Output grid's second row starts with maroon (9).
  - relationship: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - property: Grid height is 2.
  - property: Grid width is 6.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Maintain Grid Dimensions:** The output grid has the same width and height as the input grid.
2.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** Create a checkerboard pattern of alternating colors in the output grid.
3.  **Color Mapping:** Use green (3) and maroon (9) as the alternating colors.
4.  **Starting Colors**:
    *   The first row of the output starts with the color of the first row of the input (green/3).
    *   The second row of the output starts with the color of the second row of the input (maroon/9).
5. **Alternation**: within each row, alternate between original row color and the other row color.

Essentially, the program takes the two colors of the input grid and creates an alternating checkerboard pattern in the output grid, preserving the original grid dimensions. The first color in the pattern of a given row corresponds to the color in the equivalent row in the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
