The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in a checkerboard pattern. The dimensions of the grid seem to remain constant (at least in this example).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The first color in the pattern of a given row corresponds to the color in the equivalent row in the input grid.\n"
