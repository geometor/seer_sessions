## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A4F47700>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7D20A4F464A0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The output is a 1x1 grid containing a single blue pixel (represented by the number 1). The transformation seems to involve counting or summarizing the input grid in some way, resulting in a single value that corresponds to the blue color. It is likely counting a specific color, or a combination of colors within the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      elements: [0, 2] #white and red
      element_counts:
        0: 4 #white
        2: 5 #red
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [1,1]
      elements: [1] #blue
      element_counts:
        1: 1 #blue
relations:
  - type: transformation
    input: grid_3x3
    output: grid_1x1
    rule: "count_red"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2. **Output Value:** if count is greater than 0, the result it is 1.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 1x1 output grid.
4.  **Set Pixel:** Set the single pixel of the output grid to blue (value '1').

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
