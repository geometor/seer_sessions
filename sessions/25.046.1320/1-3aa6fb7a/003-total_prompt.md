Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 2), (4,4)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program**
Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have several azure (color 8) colored pixels forming two distinct 1x2 and 2x1 azure objects. The rest of the grid consists of white pixels (color 0).

2.  **Detect changes:** We can observe that a blue pixel (color 1) has been added at the right of the object at the upper left and another in the middle of the object at the lower right.

3. **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is as follow: For each azure object, place a single blue pixel (color 1) just next to it. If the object is vertical, then the blue pixel is placed to its right in the middle. If the object is horizontal, the blue pixel is placed below it.



*text:*
Okay, let's craft the Python code based on the transformation rule we've identified.

```python

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
