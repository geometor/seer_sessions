The rest of the grid consists of white pixels (color 0).\n\n2.  **Detect changes:** We can observe that a blue pixel (color 1) has been added at the right of the object at the upper left and another in the middle of the object at the lower right.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is as follow: For each azure object, place a single blue pixel (color 1) just next to it. If the object is vertical, then the blue pixel is placed to its right in the middle. If the object is horizontal, the blue pixel is placed below it.\n\n"
