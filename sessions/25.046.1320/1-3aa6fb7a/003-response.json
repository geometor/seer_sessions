The azure pixels form three separate objects, based on 8-connectivity: a horizontal 2x1 object, a vertical 1x2 object, and an additional 2x1 L shape.\n\n2.  **Detect Changes:** Blue pixels (color 1) appear next to the azure objects.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    -   For each contiguous azure (color 8) object, a single blue pixel (color 1) is placed adjacent to it.\n    - For a vertical object (height > width), the blue pixel is placed to the middle-right of the object.\n    - For horizontal objects, the objects are extended to the bottom. If they are diagonal to each other, they are treated as one.\n\nThe code already developed matches this rule.\n"
