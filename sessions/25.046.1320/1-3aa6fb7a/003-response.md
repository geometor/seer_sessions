Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's the step-by-step description, which appears to be a refinement or confirmation of the rule discovered in the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of azure (color 8) pixels and white (color 0) pixels. The azure pixels form three separate objects, based on 8-connectivity: a horizontal 2x1 object, a vertical 1x2 object, and an additional 2x1 L shape.

2.  **Detect Changes:** Blue pixels (color 1) appear next to the azure objects.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    -   For each contiguous azure (color 8) object, a single blue pixel (color 1) is placed adjacent to it.
    - For a vertical object (height > width), the blue pixel is placed to the middle-right of the object.
    - For horizontal objects, the objects are extended to the bottom. If they are diagonal to each other, they are treated as one.

The code already developed matches this rule.
