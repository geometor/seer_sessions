Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 2), (4,4)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program**
Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have several azure (color 8) colored pixels forming two distinct 1x2 and 2x1 azure objects. The rest of the grid consists of white pixels (color 0).

2.  **Detect changes:** We can observe that a blue pixel (color 1) has been added at the right of the object at the upper left and another in the middle of the object at the lower right.

3. **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is as follow: For each azure object, place a single blue pixel (color 1) just next to it. If the object is vertical, then the blue pixel is placed to its right in the middle. If the object is horizontal, the blue pixel is placed below it.

Okay, let's craft the Python code based on the transformation rule we've identified.

Okay, let's analyze the second example provided.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
  size: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
  size: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's the step-by-step description, which appears to be a refinement or confirmation of the rule discovered in the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of azure (color 8) pixels and white (color 0) pixels. The azure pixels form three separate objects, based on 8-connectivity: a horizontal 2x1 object, a vertical 1x2 object, and an additional 2x1 L shape.

2.  **Detect Changes:** Blue pixels (color 1) appear next to the azure objects.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    -   For each contiguous azure (color 8) object, a single blue pixel (color 1) is placed adjacent to it.
    - For a vertical object (height > width), the blue pixel is placed to the middle-right of the object.
    - For horizontal objects, the objects are extended to the bottom. If they are diagonal to each other, they are treated as one.

The code already developed matches this rule.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output
