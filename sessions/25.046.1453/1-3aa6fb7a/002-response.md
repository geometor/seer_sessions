Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:** Contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the top-left, and the other is a 2x1 vertical rectangle in the center-right. The rest of the grid is filled with white (color 0).
*   **Output Grid:** The azure objects remain mostly unchanged. However, a single blue pixel (color 1) appears directly to the right of the top-most azure pixel of each azure object.

**YAML Summary:**




*text:*

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8  # Azure
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: top-left, center-right
  - color: 0 # white
    shape: background

transformation:
  - action: add
    color: 1  # Blue
    position: directly right of the top-most azure pixel of each object.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid.
2.  For each azure object, locate the top-most pixel.
3.  Change the color of the pixel immediately to the right of this top-most pixel to blue (color 1).
4. All other pixels keep their color.

**Python Implementation:**
