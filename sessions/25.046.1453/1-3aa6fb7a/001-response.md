Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
   objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      positions: [[1,1], [2,1], [2,2]]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape (composed of 3 cells)
      positions: [[3,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[1,2]]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [[4,4]]
   background:
     color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects, both colored azure (8). One is an "L" shape in the top-left quadrant, and the other one is a "reverse L" shape in the bottom right quadrant. The rest of the grid is filled with the background color white (0).

2.  **Detect Change**: The azure objects did not changed. However, two new blue cells appeared.

3.  **Determine Rule of Change**: Looking at the input and the output and knowing that the azure objects did not change, the azure pixel adjacent to the top-left most azure object of the L-shape changes to blue. The azure pixel adjacent to the bottom-right most azure object of the reverse L-shape changes also to blue.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**

The azure objects are identified, and a simple predicate (change to blue the top-left most or bottom-right most azure pixel).
