*text:*
Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains objects of color '8' (blue). The rest of the grid is filled with '0' (grey), which we can consider as background.

2.  **Locate Specific Positions:** Observe the changes specifically related to the blue objects. It appears the transformation involves the spaces *immediately to the right* of a blue object.
    - To clarify, the grid will look like this, with the 'x' denoting the position described above:

```
[8][x]
```

3. **Describe the change**:
   - Find each position described above. If such a position contains a '0', change it to '1'.

**In summary:** The transformation rule is to find every instance of a '0' (grey) that is directly to the right of an '8' (blue) and then change that '0' to a '1'.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again
