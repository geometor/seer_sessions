The rest of the grid is filled with '0' (grey), which we can consider as background.\n\n2.  **Locate Specific Positions:** Observe the changes specifically related to the blue objects. It appears the transformation involves the spaces *immediately to the right* of a blue object.\n    - To clarify, the grid will look like this, with the 'x' denoting the position described above:\n\n```\n[8][x]\n```\n\n3. **Describe the change**:\n   - Find each position described above. If such a position contains a '0', change it to '1'.\n\n**In summary:** The transformation rule is to find every instance of a '0' (grey) that is directly to the right of an '8' (blue) and then change that '0' to a '1'.\n"
