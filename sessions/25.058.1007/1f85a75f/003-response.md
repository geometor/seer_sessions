Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large, complex grid (30x30) filled with various colors (represented by digits 0-9). The output is a much smaller grid (5x3) containing only the colors green (3) and white (0). It seems like the output is a highly abstracted representation of the input.  The most prominent feature in the input is a 2x2 square of green (3) pixels, surrounded by blue (1) and gray (5) pixels, near the center. It is likely that only specific, salient features of the input are reflected in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 30x30
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 1, 3, 5]  # white, blue, green, gray (based on visual inspection of input image)

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 3] # white, green

  - type: object
    color: 3  # Green
    shape: square
    dimensions: 2x2
    location: near_center #of input_grid
    name: green_square

  - type: object #other colors, perhaps acting as delimiters or background
    color: [1,5] #blue, gray
    name: delimiting_pixels
    
actions:
 - name: abstraction
   description: reducing large grid to the most salient feature

relationships:
  -  green_square is_a_part_of input_grid
  -  output_grid represents green_square
  -  delimiting_pixels surround green_square

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Salient Feature:** Locate the 2x2 square of green (3) pixels near the center of the input grid.

2.  **Extract the Feature:** Isolate the 2x2 green square.

3.  **Construct the Output:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions seem unrelated to the original grid in an obvious manner. Place the 2x2 green square near the center of the output grid.

4.  Fill remaining areas in the output grid with '0' (white). There is no obvious correlation with the remaining colors.
It is likely that the size of the output grid is consistent and the placement of the extracted object is also consistent across examples.

5. Return the result.
