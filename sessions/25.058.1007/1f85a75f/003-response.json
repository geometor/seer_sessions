The output is a much smaller grid (5x3) containing only the colors green (3) and white (0). It seems like the output is a highly abstracted representation of the input.  The most prominent feature in the input is a 2x2 square of green (3) pixels, surrounded by blue (1) and gray (5) pixels, near the center. It is likely that only specific, salient features of the input are reflected in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The dimensions seem unrelated to the original grid in an obvious manner. Place the 2x2 green square near the center of the output grid.\n\n4.
