Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the 2x2 green square within the input grid. Record its top-left corner coordinates (row, col).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid always has 3 columns.
    *   The output grid's number of rows is determined by the green square's row coordinate in the input grid.  Specifically, the number of output rows is equal to the input green square's row index + 1.
3.  **Construct:** Create an output grid with the determined dimensions, initially filled with black (or white, doesn't matter for this rule since it is overwritten).
4. **Populate the green pixels:**
    * Place the 2x2 green square from input to the output, with the top-left at (0,0)
    * Add a green pixel to each output row at column 2.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
