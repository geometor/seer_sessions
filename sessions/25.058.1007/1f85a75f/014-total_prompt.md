Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses on identifying and copying or extending rectangular and cross-shaped objects. It prioritizes complete shapes and attempts to extend partial shapes into rectangles. This approach works for the first example but fails on subsequent examples, where the transformations involve different logic like:

-   **Example 2**:  The transformation in the second example is more nuanced. It doesn't involve copying or extending a shape, but instead seems to extract and reposition certain pixels within a frame.
- **Example 3**: copying specific portions of lines
-   **Example 4**:  Seems to involve identifying colored lines and extracting sections where they overlap with other colors.

The primary issue is that the initial code's assumption of copying or extending shapes is too narrow. It needs to incorporate more general pattern recognition and manipulation capabilities, such as:

1.  **Identifying lines and their intersections**: Many examples involve manipulating horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines.
2.  **Extracting sub-regions**:  Instead of just whole shapes, the logic might require extracting specific parts of the grid based on color or relative position.
3.  **Repositioning elements**:  Moving pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, possibly based on a defined rule.
4.  **Conditional logic:** The correct approach may need to consider the input and consider multiple possible solutions.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformations, I'll gather metrics and observations for each example using code execution. I'll focus on:

*   Object counts and colors in input and output.
*   Presence of lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
*   Relationships between input and output objects (e.g., containment, intersection).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
