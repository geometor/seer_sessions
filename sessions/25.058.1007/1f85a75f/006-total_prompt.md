Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Salient Feature:** Locate the 2x2 square of green (3) pixels near the center of the input grid.
2.  **Extract the Feature:** Isolate the 2x2 green square.
3.  **Construct the Output:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions seem unrelated to the original grid in an obvious manner. Place the 2x2 green square near the center of the output grid.
4.  Fill remaining areas in the output grid with '0' (white). There is no obvious correlation with the remaining colors.
It is likely that the size of the output grid is consistent and the placement of the extracted object is also consistent across examples.
5. Return the result.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a refined strategy.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, correctly identifying and extracting a 2x2 green square. However, it assumed a fixed output size (5x3) and a specific placement of the extracted square within that output. The subsequent training examples reveal that this assumption is incorrect. The output size is not constant, and simple extraction of a 2x2 green square is not the full rule. The additional column of green implies some sort of mirroring or extension.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Output Size:** The output grid size is *not* fixed. We need to determine the rule governing the output dimensions. It's likely related to the *position* or *properties* of the green square in the input.

2.  **Re-evaluate Object Placement:** While a green square is present, an added vertical line is also present. The relationship between the input and output will need to be updated.

3.  **Consider All Examples:** The transformation rule must hold for *all* training examples. We need to find a pattern that explains the variations in output size and content based on the input.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: green_square
    type: rectangle
    color: green
    size: 2x2
    properties:
      - found_in_all_inputs: true
      - coordinates_vary: true

  - object: output_grid
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      - dimensions_vary: true
      - always_contains_green_square: true
      - always_3_columns: true
      - row_count: varies_by_example
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the 2x2 green square within the input grid. Record its top-left corner coordinates (row, col).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid always has 3 columns.
    *   The output grid's number of rows is determined by the green square's row coordinate in the input grid.  Specifically, the number of output rows is equal to the input green square's row index + 1.
3.  **Construct:** Create an output grid with the determined dimensions, initially filled with black (or white, doesn't matter for this rule since it is overwritten).
4. **Populate the green pixels:**
    * Place the 2x2 green square from input to the output, with the top-left at (0,0)
    * Add a green pixel to each output row at column 2.

This revised natural language program accounts for the varying output sizes and the consistent presence of the 2x2 green square and the column of green. It correctly relates the input green square's row position to the output's row count.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
