"""
1.  **Identify the Salient Feature:** Locate the 2x2 square of green (3) pixels near the center of the input grid.
2.  **Extract the Feature:** Isolate the 2x2 green square.
3.  **Construct the Output:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions seem unrelated to the original grid in an obvious manner. Place the 2x2 green square near the center of the output grid.
4.  Fill remaining areas in the output grid with '0' (white). There is no obvious correlation with the remaining colors.
It is likely that the size of the output grid is consistent and the placement of the extracted object is also consistent across examples.
5. Return the result.
