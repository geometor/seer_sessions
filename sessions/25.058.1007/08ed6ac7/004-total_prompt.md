Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (9x9).
*   The input grid contains only 0 (white) and 5 (gray) pixels.
*   The output grid contains 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow) pixels.
*   The gray pixels in the input seem to be replaced by colored pixels in the output, while the white pixels remain white.
*   The positions of gray pixels in the input correspond to the colored pixels' positions in the output.
*   There is one single continguous vertical line of color 5. The color changes in the output grid.
*   The different colors in the output may represent a sequential labeling or categorization of the gray "objects" in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    input_colors: [0, 5]
    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  - observation: "Gray (5) pixels in the input are replaced by colored pixels (1, 2, 3, 4) in the output."
  - observation: "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - object: vertical_lines
    description: "contiguous set of same-colored pixels from top to bottom"
    input_color: 5
    output_colors: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    relationship: sequential mapping, each vertical segment of 5 is turned into a unique color
  - relationship: "The spatial arrangement of pixels is preserved during the transformation, except for the color change."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all vertical lines of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. A vertical line must go from top edge to bottom edge.
2.  **Assign Colors:** Assign a unique color to each identified vertical line, following a sequence:
    *   The first line (from left) gets color 1 (blue).
    *   The Second segment gets color 2 (red).
    *   The third segment gets color 3 (green).
    *   The fouth segment gets color 4 (yellow)
3.  **Transform:** Replace each gray pixel in the input grid with the new color assigned for its corresponding object, leave white pixels.
4. **Output:** Create the output grid with all the new colors set.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
