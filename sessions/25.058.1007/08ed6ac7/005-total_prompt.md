Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all vertical lines of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. A vertical line must go from top edge to bottom edge.
2.  **Assign Colors:** Assign a unique color to each identified vertical line, following a sequence:
    *   The first line (from left) gets color 1 (blue).
    *   The Second segment gets color 2 (red).
    *   The third segment gets color 3 (green).
    *   The fouth segment gets color 4 (yellow)
3.  **Transform:** Replace each gray pixel in the input grid with the new color assigned for its corresponding object, leave white pixels.
4. **Output:** Create the output grid with all the new colors set.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
