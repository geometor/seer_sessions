A segment is defined as one or more vertically adjacent gray pixels. The length and position of each segment should be recorded.\n\n2.  **Order Segments:** Sort the identified segments based on their horizontal position (column index) from left to right.\n\n3.  **Assign Colors:** Assign a unique color to each segment based on its order:\n    *   The leftmost segment receives color 1 (blue).\n    *   The second segment from the left receives color 2 (red).\n    *   The third segment receives color 3 (green).\n    *   The fourth segment receives color 4 (yellow).\n    *   If there are more than four segments, any additional segment will not change color.\n\n4.  **Transform:** For each identified segment, iterate through its pixels and replace the gray (5) color with the assigned color. Pixels that are not part of a gray vertical segment are not modified.\n\n5.  **Output:** Create the output grid containing the transformed pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_vertical_segments(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous vertical line segments of a specified color.\"\"\"\n    segments = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for j in range(cols):\n        in_segment = False\n        start_row = -1\n        for i in range(rows):\n            if grid[i, j] == color:\n                if not in_segment:\n                    in_segment = True\n                    start_row = i\n            elif in_segment:\n                in_segment = False\n                segments.append(((start_row, j), (i - 1, j)))  # (start, end)\n                start_row = -1\n        if in_segment:  # Handle segment at the end of the column\n            segments.append(((start_row, j), (rows - 1, j)))\n    return segments\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find vertical line segments of gray (5) pixels\n    gray_segments = find_vertical_segments(input_grid, 5)\n\n    # Sort segments by column (x-coordinate of start point)\n    sorted_segments = sorted(gray_segments, key=lambda seg: seg[0][1])\n\n    # Assign colors sequentially\n    color_map = {\n        0: 1,  # First segment: blue\n        1: 2,  # Second segment: red\n        2: 3,  # Third segment: green\n        3: 4,   # Fourth segment: yellow\n    }\n\n    # change output pixels\n    for index, segment in enumerate(sorted_segments):\n        start, end = segment\n        start_row, start_col = start\n        end_row, end_col = end\n        new_color = color_map.get(index, 0) # Default to white (0) if index is out of range\n        if new_color != 0:\n             for i in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n                 output_grid[i, start_col] = new_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
