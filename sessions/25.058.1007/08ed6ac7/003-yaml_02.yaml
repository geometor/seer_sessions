facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    input_colors: [0, 5]
    output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  - observation: "Gray (5) pixels in the input are replaced by colored pixels (1, 2, 3, 4) in the output."
  - observation: "White (0) pixels remain unchanged."
  - object: vertical_lines
    description: "contiguous set of same-colored pixels from top to bottom"
    input_color: 5
    output_colors: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    relationship: sequential mapping, each vertical segment of 5 is turned into a unique color
  - relationship: "The spatial arrangement of pixels is preserved during the transformation, except for the color change."
