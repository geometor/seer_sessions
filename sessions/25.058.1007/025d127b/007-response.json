The primary colors observed are:\n\n*   **0 (White):** Background color.\n*   **6 (Magenta):** Forms a shape in the upper part of the grid.\n*   **2 (Red):** Forms a shape in the lower part of the grid.\n\nThe transformation appears to modify the position or contents of some of the magenta pixels, but keep the red shape unchanged. There is one major object for each color, with some pixels related to lines or curves.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
