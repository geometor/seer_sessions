            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, aiming to preserve only the top-right azure pixel of a connected azure shape. The results on the full training set reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize to all cases. Some examples have multiple disconnected azure shapes, and others involve different criteria for preservation than simply the top-right pixel.\n\nThe strategy will be:\n\n1. **Analyze each example:** Examine the input, expected output, and actual output of the code. Identify discrepancies.\n2. **Identify common patterns and exceptions:** Look for consistent rules that apply across multiple examples, as well as cases where the initial rule fails.\n3. **Refine the natural language program:** Develop a more general description that accounts for the observed variations in the transformations. Focus on object identification, and actions applied to them.\n4. **Hypothesize about object properties:** determine if shape, position, size,\n   or other object attributes are part of the transformation.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo thoroughly analyze the examples, I need to visually inspect the input, expected output, and actual output grids. Since I am a text-based system, the previous execution results have represented grids as simplified lists of non-zero pixels. I will use this representation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, along with observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[(0, 5, 8), (1, 5, 8), (2, 5, 8), (3, 5, 8), (4, 5, 8), (5, 5, 8), (6, 5, 8), (7, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[(0, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[(0, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Observation: The code correctly identified and preserved the top-right azure pixel.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[(1, 4, 8), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 8), (2, 5, 8), (3, 4, 8)]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[(2, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[(2, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Observation: The code correctly identified and preserved the top-right azure pixel of the connected shape.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: `[(2, 5, 8), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 8), (3, 6, 8), (4, 3, 8), (4, 4, 8), (4, 5, 8), (4, 6, 8), (4, 7, 8), (5, 2, 8), (5, 3, 8), (5, 4, 8), (5, 5, 8), (5, 6, 8), (5, 7, 8), (5, 8, 8), (6, 3, 8), (6, 4, 8), (6, 5, 8), (6, 6, 8), (6, 7, 8), (7, 4, 8), (7, 5, 8), (7, 6, 8), (8, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[(5, 8, 8)]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[(5, 8, 8)]`\n    *   Observation: The code correctly preserved the top-right pixel.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input:  `[(0, 5, 8), (1, 5, 8), (2, 5, 8), (3, 5, 8), (4, 5, 8), (5, 5, 8), (6, 5, 8), (7, 5, 8), (1, 7, 8), (2, 7, 8), (3, 7, 8), (4, 7, 8), (5, 7, 8), (6, 7, 8), (3, 1, 8), (3, 2, 8), (4, 1, 8), (4, 2, 8), (5, 1, 8), (5, 2, 8)]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[(0, 5, 8), (1, 7, 8), (3, 2, 8)]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[(0, 5, 8)]`\n    *   Observation: **Incorrect.** The code only preserved the top-right azure pixel of the *first* connected shape it found. It did *not* preserve the top-right of the *other* shapes.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: azure (8)\n    description: Shapes formed by connected azure pixels.  Multiple, disconnected shapes can exist.\n    attributes:\n      - connected: Pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n      - top_right:  The pixel within a connected shape that has the largest column index and, among those with the largest column index, the smallest row index. This attribute is relevant to the transformation.\nactions:\n  - preserve: Keep the top-right pixel of each disconnected azure shape.\n  - clear: Change the color of all other azure pixels to white (0).\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nIdentify all disconnected azure (8) shapes within the input grid. For each of these shapes, find the top-right pixel. Preserve these top-right pixels. Change all other azure pixels in the entire grid to white (0).\n"
