task_description: |
  The task involves identifying plus-shaped objects made of orange pixels with a red pixel center, expanding them into hollow rectangles, and filling the spaces between these expanded shapes with red pixels, while preserving the red center pixels.

observations:
  - object_types:
      - plus_shape:
          definition: "An object composed of orange (7) pixels forming a '+' shape, with a single red (2) pixel at its geometric center."
          properties:
            color: [7, 2]  # Orange and Red
            shape: "+"
            center_color: 2  # Red
      - expanded_shape:
          definition: "The smallest rectangle that fully encloses a plus_shape, formed with orange(7) pixels on the border."
          properties:
            color: 7 #orange
            shape: "rectangle"

  - actions:
      - identify:
          target: plus_shape
          method: "Scan the grid to find pixels that match the plus_shape definition."
      - expand:
          target: plus_shape
          method: "Create the smallest rectangle of orange pixels that contains the entire plus_shape, keeping the original red (2) pixel"
      - fill:
          target: "space between expanded shapes"
          method: "Change pixels to red (2) in the area between the expanded shapes' outer orange edges, but do not overwrite the orange borders themselves or any existing red centers."

  - constraints:
      - "Expansion must maintain the original red (2) pixel at the plus shape's center."
      - "Filling should not overwrite the expanded shape's orange border."
      -  "Only fill *between* objects, do not fill the entire image."
