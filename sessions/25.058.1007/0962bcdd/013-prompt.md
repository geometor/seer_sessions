Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate all "cross" shapes in the input grid. A cross is defined as a central magenta (6) pixel surrounded by four azure (8) pixels, one in each orthogonal direction (up, down, left, right).

2.  **Expand to Squares:** For each identified cross:
    *   Replace the entire 3x3 area centered on the cross's original magenta pixel with azure (8) pixels. This creates a 3x3 azure square.

3. **Replicate Magenta Pixels (Simplified Rule):**
     - Find the bounding box that contains the initial "cross."
     - Identify all the magenta pixels that constitute the border.
     - Replicate the border around the expanded azure square. The expanded border size should be original border size + 2.
     - Ensure corner pixels are included.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
