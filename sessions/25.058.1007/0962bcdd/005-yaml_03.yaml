- task: "Plus Shape Expansion and Connection"
  observations:
    - object_type: PlusShape
      color: orange (7)
      center: red (2)
      description: "A contiguous block of orange pixels forming a plus shape with a single red pixel in the center."
      count: dynamic  # Number of plus shapes varies per example
    - object_type: ExpandedShape
      color: orange (7) and red (2)
      description: "The expanded form of the PlusShape, creating hollow rectangles."
      relationship: "Derived from PlusShape by expansion."
    - object_type: FilledArea
      color: red (2)
      description: "The area between and including the ExpandedShapes, filled entirely with red pixels."
      relationship: "Connects and encompasses ExpandedShapes."
  actions:
    - action: Identify
      target: PlusShape
      method: "Find connected components of orange (7) pixels with a red (2) center."
    - action: Expand
      target: PlusShape
      method: "Expand each PlusShape outwards to form a hollow rectangle/square."
    - action: Fill
      target: Area between and including ExpandedShapes
      method: "Completely fill the area between ExpandedShapes, as well as their outlines, with red (2) pixels."
      color: red (2)
