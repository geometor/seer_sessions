The shape should expand outwards.\n\n3.  **Connect the expanded shapes** Place 'red' (2) pixels between two shapes. These red pixels form two separate diagonals connecting all 4 corners of the original shapes.\n\n4. Fill in the area between plus-shaped objects with lines of \"red\" (2). The \"red\" (2) lines fill the two newly formed diagnols.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_plus_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds plus-shaped objects (7s surrounding a 2).\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, obj):\n        if not is_valid(r, c) or visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] not in (2, 7):\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, obj)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, obj)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, obj)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, obj)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 7 and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, obj)\n                # Check if it's a plus shape with a 2 in the center\n                if any(grid[row, col] == 2 for row, col in obj):\n                   is_plus = True\n                   center = None\n                   for row,col in obj:\n                       if grid[row,col] == 2:\n                           if center is not None:\n                               is_plus = False\n                               break # only 1 center of 2 allowed\n                           else:\n                               center = (row,col)\n                   if is_plus:\n                        orange_neighbors = 0\n                        if center:\n                            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                                nr, nc = center[0] + dr, center[1] + dc\n                                if is_valid(nr,nc) and grid[nr,nc] == 7:\n                                     orange_neighbors += 1\n                        if orange_neighbors == 4:\n                            objects.append(obj)\n\n\n    return objects\n\ndef expand_plus(grid, plus_object):\n    \"\"\"Expands the plus-shaped object into a hollow square.\"\"\"\n    # Find the bounding box of the plus object\n    min_r, min_c = plus_object[0]\n    max_r, max_c = plus_object[0]\n    for r, c in plus_object:\n        min_r = min(min_r, r)\n        min_c = min(min_c, c)\n        max_r = max(max_r, r)\n        max_c = max(max_c, c)\n\n    # Create the expanded hollow square\n    expanded_object = []\n    for r in range(min_r - 1, max_r + 2):\n        for c in range(min_c - 1, max_c + 2):\n            if (min_r -1 <= r <= max_r + 1) and (min_c - 1 <= c <= max_c+1):\n                expanded_object.append((r, c))\n    return expanded_object\n\ndef connect_shapes(grid, expanded_object1, expanded_object2):\n   \"\"\"Connects the two expanded shapes with lines of 2s\"\"\"\n   min_r1, min_c1 = expanded_object1[0][0], expanded_object1[0][1]\n   for r, c in expanded_object1:\n      if r <= min_r1:\n         min_r1 = r\n      if c <= min_c1:\n         min_c1 = c\n\n   max_r2, max_c2 = expanded_object2[0][0], expanded_object2[0][1]\n   for r, c in expanded_object2:\n       if r >= max_r2:\n           max_r2 = r\n       if c >= max_c2:\n           max_c2 = c\n\n\n   # top left of first object\n   #grid[min_r1-1, min_c1-1] = 2\n\n   # top left to bottom right\n   r, c = min_r1, min_c1\n   while  r <= max_r2 and c <= max_c2:\n       if not (r, c) in expanded_object1 and not (r, c) in expanded_object2:\n            grid[r,c] = 2\n       r += 1\n       c += 1\n   # bottom right of first object to top left of second object\n   r, c = min_r1, max_c1\n   while r <= max_r2 and c >= min_c2:\n      if not (r,c) in expanded_object1 and not(r,c) in expanded_object2:\n         grid[r,c] = 2\n      r += 1\n      c -= 1\n\n   return\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.\"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)  # Convert to NumPy array for easier manipulation\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)  # Initialize output grid\n\n    # 1.
