The crosses appear in two distinct parts of the grid, and there may be mirroring of crosses.\n*   **Output:** A grid of the same shape, and the plus shapes grow in size outwards, and the color in corners are different.\n* **Colors**: the input and output use the same colors, but the output uses more colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
