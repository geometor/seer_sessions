There are two distinct \"cross\" shapes. One is in the top-left quadrant, centered around a magenta (6) pixel, with azure (8) pixels surrounding it. The other is in the bottom-right quadrant, with an identical structure.\n*   **Output:** A 12x12 grid, also mostly black. The \"cross\" shapes from the input are transformed. The azure (8) pixels now form a larger, 3x3 \"square\" structure, while the central magenta (6) pixels of the input crosses now appear to outline the azure squares, and, importantly, are duplicated at the edges and corners of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These are identified by a central magenta (6) pixel surrounded by four azure (8) pixels in a cross pattern.\n\n2.  **Transform to Squares:** For each cross:\n    *   Expand the azure (8) pixels outwards to form a 3x3 filled square of azure pixels.\n    *   Replace the central magenta(6) pixel of original with an azure (8).\n\n3.  **Border Replication:** Replicate the magenta pixels:\n     * The central magenta now appears at each corner of the azure squares.\n     * The original magenta pixel and its horizontal neighbors are duplicated to above and below the expanded azure square.\n     * The original magenta pixel and its vertical neighbors are duplicate to the left and right of the expanded azure square.\n     * Replicate the magenta at the corners (top, bottom, left, right)\n\nIn essence, the transformation expands the azure parts of the crosses into squares and replicates the original magenta pixels along the new perimeter, and corners, of the squares.\n"
