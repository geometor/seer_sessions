Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate the two "cross" shapes in the input grid. These are identified by a central magenta (6) pixel surrounded by four azure (8) pixels in a cross pattern.

2.  **Transform to Squares:** For each cross:
    *   Expand the azure (8) pixels outwards to form a 3x3 filled square of azure pixels.
    *   Replace the central magenta(6) pixel of original with an azure (8).

3.  **Border Replication:** Replicate the magenta pixels:
     * The central magenta now appears at each corner of the azure squares.
     * The original magenta pixel and its horizontal neighbors are duplicated to above and below the expanded azure square.
     * The original magenta pixel and its vertical neighbors are duplicate to the left and right of the expanded azure square.
     * Replicate the magenta at the corners (top, bottom, left, right)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
