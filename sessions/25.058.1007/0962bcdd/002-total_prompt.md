<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1596x1586 at 0x7EE11FF52E90>Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Grids containing colored "cross" shapes. Each cross consists of a central pixel and four pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right). The crosses appear in two distinct parts of the grid, and there may be mirroring of crosses.
*   **Output:** A grid of the same shape, and the plus shapes grow in size outwards, and the color in corners are different.
* **Colors**: the input and output use the same colors, but the output uses more colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: cross
    type: shape
    description: A five-pixel pattern resembling a plus sign (+).
    properties:
      center_color: integer (0-9)
      arm_color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column) # Coordinates of the center pixel.

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The cross shape grows outwards.
    details:
      - The arm pixels extend outward and become a sequence of connected pixels
        of the same color,
      - The center pixel becomes a square 2 x 2 with original color.
      - The arm extensions connect.
      - corner color: the connected part forms corners, with the other color.

relationships:
   - input_output: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
   - cross_expansion: each cross in the input becomes a larger connected "plus like" shape in output.
   - color_preservation: colors are the same
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate all "cross" shapes in the input grid. A cross is defined as a central pixel and four adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) of a different color.

2.  **Expand Crosses:** For each identified cross:
    *   Expand the center color into a 2x2 block of the same color, overwriting any previous values in those positions.
    *   Extend each of the four "arms" of the cross outward by one pixel in each direction, and connected at the corner, with the color of the "arm"
    * Connect the arms with a third color.

3. Replicate to fill the space between the input objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
