Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 12x12 grid mostly filled with black (0) pixels. There are two distinct "cross" shapes. One is in the top-left quadrant, centered around a magenta (6) pixel, with azure (8) pixels surrounding it. The other is in the bottom-right quadrant, with an identical structure.
*   **Output:** A 12x12 grid, also mostly black. The "cross" shapes from the input are transformed. The azure (8) pixels now form a larger, 3x3 "square" structure, while the central magenta (6) pixels of the input crosses now appear to outline the azure squares, and, importantly, are duplicated at the edges and corners of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: cross1
    type: shape
    color: composite (azure and magenta)
    initial_position: top-left quadrant
    initial_structure:
      center: magenta (6)
      surrounding: azure (8) in cross pattern
  - name: cross2
    type: shape
    color: composite (azure and magenta)
    initial_position: bottom-right quadrant
    initial_structure:
      center: magenta (6)
      surrounding: azure (8) in cross pattern
  - name: output_square1
     type: shape
     color: azure(8)
     final_position: top-left
     final_structure: 3x3 filled square
  - name: output_square2
     type: shape
     color: azure(8)
     final_position: bottom-right
     final_structure: 3x3 filled square
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: cross to square
    agent: unknown
  - type: replication
    description: the magenta pixels now border the azure squares
relationships:
  - input_cross_to_output_square: cross1 becomes output_square1, cross2 becomes output_square2
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate the two "cross" shapes in the input grid. These are identified by a central magenta (6) pixel surrounded by four azure (8) pixels in a cross pattern.

2.  **Transform to Squares:** For each cross:
    *   Expand the azure (8) pixels outwards to form a 3x3 filled square of azure pixels.
    *   Replace the central magenta(6) pixel of original with an azure (8).

3.  **Border Replication:** Replicate the magenta pixels:
     * The central magenta now appears at each corner of the azure squares.
     * The original magenta pixel and its horizontal neighbors are duplicated to above and below the expanded azure square.
     * The original magenta pixel and its vertical neighbors are duplicate to the left and right of the expanded azure square.
     * Replicate the magenta at the corners (top, bottom, left, right)

In essence, the transformation expands the azure parts of the crosses into squares and replicates the original magenta pixels along the new perimeter, and corners, of the squares.
