Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grids contain a few isolated, non-zero pixels (representing colors other than white/0) within a field of zeros. The output grids show these non-zero pixels expanding to fill rectangular regions, effectively "flooding" parts of the grid. The original non-zero pixels act as "seeds" for these flooded regions. The flooding seems to stop at the grid boundaries and maintains the original colors. It appears that there are always exactly two non zero colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value. These are the "seed" pixels.
2.  **For Each Seed Pixel:**
    *   Create a rectangular region filled with the seed pixel's color.
    *   The rectangle's top-left corner will alternate position, depending on parity:
        *   If the seed pixel is the first seed pixel encountered scanning the grid in row-major order, it's top-left corner is that seed pixel, and the lower-right corner will be the bottom right-hand corner of the grid.
        *   If the seed pixel is the second seed pixel, it's top-left corner will be top-left corner of the grid, and bottom right corner is the location of that seed pixel.
3. **Combine the regions**
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.
