Both grids are 10x10. The input grid contains two distinct non-zero pixels: a blue pixel (value 1) and a yellow pixel (value 4). The output grid seems to expand these pixels into distinct regions. The blue pixel seems to define the top region and expands to fill some parts. Yellow does the same for a bottom section.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
