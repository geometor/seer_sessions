Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 10x10. The input grid contains two distinct non-zero pixels: a blue pixel (value 1) and a yellow pixel (value 4). The output grid seems to expand these pixels into distinct regions. The blue pixel seems to define the top region and expands to fill some parts. Yellow does the same for a bottom section.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        position: [2, 6]
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
        position: [7, 5]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        position: all other cells

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        position: Top section expanded from input blue
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
        position: bottom section expanded from input yellow
      - color: white
      	value: 0
      	position: middle section

relationships:
   - input_grid elements are transformed to create output_grid regions

actions:
 - expansion: colors blue and yellow expand into regions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** In the input grid, locate the blue pixel (1) and the yellow pixel (4).

2.  **Blue Expansion (Top Region):**
    *   The blue starts at the row where blue exists in the input.
    *   Blue fills the entire rows above it.
    *   The expansion extends horizontally across entire rows.
    *    Blue expands downwards from its original position to the rows above where yellow is present.

3.  **Yellow Expansion (Bottom Region):**
    *   The yellow starts at the row where it is originally in the input
    *   Yellow fills the entire rows below where yellow is present in input.
    *    Yellow expands upwards from its original location to the rows below where blue is present.
    *   The expansion extends horizontally across entire rows.
4. If an output region is neither blue or yellow, it must be white (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
