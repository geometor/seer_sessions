      input_objects:
        - color: blue
          positions: [(2, 1)]
        - color: yellow
          positions: [(4, 1)]
      output_objects:
        - color: blue
          positions: All cells in rows 0, 1, and 2
        - color: yellow
          positions: All cells in rows 4 and 5
        - color: black
          positions: All cells in row 3.
      transformations:
        - blue expands upward from its initial position
        - yellow expands downward from its initial position
        - expansion stops when another color or edge is reached

  - example_1:
        input_objects:
            - color: yellow
              positions: [(1,1)]
        output_objects:
            - color: yellow
              positions: All cells in rows 1-5
        transformations:
            - yellow expands downwards until edge of grid is reached

  - example_2:
        input_objects:
          - color: blue
            positions: [(3,1)]
        output_objects:
          - color: blue
            positions: All cells in rows 0-3.
        transformations:
            - blue expands upwards and downwards until row 3, and then stops
