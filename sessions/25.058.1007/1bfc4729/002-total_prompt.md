**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grids contain a few isolated, non-zero pixels (representing colors other than white/0) within a field of zeros. The output grids show these non-zero pixels expanding to fill rectangular regions, effectively "flooding" parts of the grid. The original non-zero pixels act as "seeds" for these flooded regions. The flooding seems to stop at the grid boundaries and maintains the original colors. It appears that there are always exactly two non zero colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**

objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output data.
    properties:
      - name: pixels
        type: integer
        description: Values represent colors (0-9).
      - name: width
        type: integer
      - name: height
        type: integer

    properties:

    parameters:

  - type: region_bounds
    description: Flooded regions are bounded by the edges of the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value. These are the "seed" pixels.
2.  **For Each Seed Pixel:**
    *   Create a rectangular region filled with the seed pixel's color.
    *   The rectangle's top-left corner will alternate position, depending on parity:
        *   If the seed pixel is the first seed pixel encountered scanning the grid in row-major order, it's top-left corner is that seed pixel, and the lower-right corner will be the bottom right-hand corner of the grid.
        *   If the seed pixel is the second seed pixel, it's top-left corner will be top-left corner of the grid, and bottom right corner is the location of that seed pixel.
3. **Combine the regions**
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
