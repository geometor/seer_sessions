Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and try to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** Each input is a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit representing a color (0-9). It seems like the grids always have a black background (color 0) and a single other color.
*   **Output:** The output is a smaller grid (either 1x1, 1x2, or 2x2) containing only the non-black color from the input grid. The number of times that non black color appears is equal to the number of that color in one row or colum of the grid, or the total count of pixels.
*   **Transformation:** It appears that the transformation isolates the non-black color and constructs a new grid. The dimensions of this new grid are determined by the total amount of the isolated color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0-9]
      - has_background: true
      - background_color: 0
  - object: non_zero_color
    type: color
    properties:
     - value: varies per example
     - representation: single_digit
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - colors: [non_zero_color]
  - action: isolate_color
    description: "Find the color that isn't 0"
  - action: get_count_of_isolated_color
    description: "Get how many elements of that isolated color exist"
  - action: create_output_grid
      description: "build n x m output grid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-black color:** Examine the input grid and determine the single color value that is not 0.
2.  **Count the occurrences:** Count number of cells with the non-black color, save as N.
3.  **Create the output grid**: Create output of N of isolated color.
