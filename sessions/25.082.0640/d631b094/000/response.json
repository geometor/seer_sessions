The input grids seem to contain a single non-zero \"object\", defined by connected pixels of the same color (other than black, which seems to be the background). The output grids appear to be related to the non-zero colored object in the input grids, representing some reduced form. The size of the output is always smaller than the input. The output grid contains only the color presented in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically it appears to represent a compressed version.\n  - action: Input grids are transformed into output grids. The transformation removes all the black pixels and counts the non-black pixels, generating a row of those pixels.\n```"
