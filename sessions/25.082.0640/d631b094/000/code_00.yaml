facts:
  - observation: Input grids are rectangular and contain pixels of different colors (represented by integers).
  - observation: Output grids are rectangular and contain pixels of a single color.
  - observation:  The color in the output grid is always present in the corresponding input grid.
  - observation:  The color 0 (black) appears to be the background and is present in all input grids.
  - observation:  Non-zero colors form connected components, potentially considered as single "objects".
  - relationship: Output grid size is smaller than or equal to the input grid size.
  - relationship: The number of non-zero pixels in the output grid seems related to the number of non-zero pixels of that color in the input grid. Specifically it appears to represent a compressed version.
  - action: Input grids are transformed into output grids. The transformation removes all the black pixels and counts the non-black pixels, generating a row of those pixels.
