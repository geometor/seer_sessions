Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation takes a 2x6 grid as input. The output grid is also 2x6. The colors in the output grid alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in both rows and columns. Specifically:

1.  The first row of the output alternates starting with green: green, maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon.
2.  The second row of the output alternates starting with maroon: maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon, green.
3. Each column alternates between green and maroon.

Essentially. The transformation creates a checkerboard pattern using the two colors from the input rows.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # Define the color mapping
    green = 3
    maroon = 9
    
    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Alternate colors based on row and column indices
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = green  # Even sum: green
            else:
                output_grid[i, j] = maroon # Odd sum: maroon

    return output_grid

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too specific to the colors in the first example (green and maroon). The second example demonstrates that the transformation rule is about alternating colors based on row and column position, *not* specifically about using green and maroon. The code correctly implements the checkerboard pattern but uses hardcoded colors instead of referencing the input grid's colors. The strategy is to generalize the program to use the colors from the input.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating the results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Two rows of the same color. First row is green, second is maroon.
    *   Expected Output: Checkerboard pattern of green and maroon.
    *   Transformed Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   Result: Success. This reinforced the initial (though overly specific) hypothesis.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two rows, of the same color, all yellow in the top, azure in the bottom.
    *   Expected Output: Checkerboard pattern using yellow and azure.
    *   Transformed Output: Checkerboard of green and maroon (incorrect colors).
    *   Result: Failure (color mismatch). This reveals the flaw in the initial hypothesis: the colors are not fixed, but should be derived.

        Colors alternate horizontally and vertically.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 2x6 grid.
2.  **Output:** A 2x6 grid.
3.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** Create a checkerboard pattern in the output grid.
4.  **Color Derivation**:
    *   The color of the pixel at output\[0,0] (top-left) is the same as the
        color of the pixels of the first row of the input grid.
    *   The color of the pixel at output\[1,0] is the same as the color of the
        pixels of the second row of the input.
5.  **Alternation:** Colors alternate in both rows and columns, creating the checkerboard effect. Each cell's color is determined by whether the sum of its row and column indices is even or odd. If even, it takes the top-left color, otherwise it will take the color that is directly below the top left color.

Essentially, the program transforms any two input rows of uniform, but
potentially differing, color into a checkerboard pattern using those two input
colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
