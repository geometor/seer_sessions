Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation takes a 2x6 grid as input. The output grid is also 2x6. The colors in the output grid alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in both rows and columns. Specifically:

1.  The first row of the output alternates starting with green: green, maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon.
2.  The second row of the output alternates starting with maroon: maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon, green.
3. Each column alternates between green and maroon.

Essentially. The transformation creates a checkerboard pattern using the two colors from the input rows.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # Define the color mapping
    green = 3
    maroon = 9
    
    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Alternate colors based on row and column indices
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = green  # Even sum: green
            else:
                output_grid[i, j] = maroon # Odd sum: maroon

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

Input:
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```
Expected Output:
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```
Transformed Output:
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
