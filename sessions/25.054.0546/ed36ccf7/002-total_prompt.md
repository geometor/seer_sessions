## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE5FEE60>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE5FDE40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid also contains maroon and white pixels, but their positions have changed. The transformation appears to involve a specific rearrangement of the pixels within the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 9]  # white, maroon

actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description: pixels are moved within the grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The positions of specific colored pixels change relative to each other.
  - type: before-after
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid's contents. Specifically, the top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and the leftmost column of the input becomes the top row of the output. The single white pixel is moved to the top-left while the other white squares are moved to fill in the first two squares of the first column.

1.  The pixel at input (0,0) moves to output (0,2).
2.  The pixel at input (0,1) moves to output(1,2).
3.  The pixel at input (0,2) moves to output (2,2).
4.  The pixel at (1,0) moves to (0,1).
5.  The pixel at (2,0) moves to (0,0).

```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
