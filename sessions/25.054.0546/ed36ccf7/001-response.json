Specifically, the top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and the leftmost column of the input becomes the top row of the output. The single white pixel is moved to the top-left while the other white squares are moved to fill in the first two squares of the first column.\n\n1.  The pixel at input (0,0) moves to output (0,2).\n2.  The pixel at input (0,1) moves to output(1,2).\n3.  The pixel at input (0,2) moves to output (2,2).\n4.  The pixel at (1,0) moves to (0,1).\n5.
