            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with an updated natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code, which rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise, correctly transform examples 1 and 3. However, examples 2 and 4 show a discrepancy. The core issue seems to be not in the rotation itself, but that some pixels have moved. A simple rotation should account for every pixel but in Examples 2 and 4 one pixel has been moved.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Basic Rotation:** Re-affirm that the fundamental operation is indeed a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n2. **Analyze Discrepancies:** Investigate examples 2 and 4 more closely, paying attention to where the error occurs, looking at the exact position by comparing the transformed output to the actual output to gather more information.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example by Example):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Observation: Rotation is correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Observation: Rotation is almost correct, the magenta pixel at \\[2,0] should be at \\[2,2]\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Observation: Rotation is correct.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Observation: Rotation is mostly correct - the red pixel at \\[0,0] should be at \\[0,2]\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n      objects:\n        - color: maroon (9)\n          initial_positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [1,1], [2,1], [1,2], [2,2]]\n          final_positions:  [[0,2], [1,2], [2,2], [0,1], [1,1], [0,0], [1,0]]\n        - color: white (0)\n          initial_positions: [[0,1], [0,2]]\n          final_positions: [[1,2], [2,2]]\n      match: True\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n      objects:\n        - color: white (0)\n          initial_positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,2]]\n          final_positions: [[0,2], [0,1], [1,1], [2,1], [2,0]]\n        - color: magenta (6)\n          initial_positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [2,0], [2,1]]\n          final_positions:  [[1,2], [2,2], [0,0], [1,0]]\n      match: False\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n      objects:\n          - color: white (0)\n            initial_positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]]\n            final_positions: [[0,2], [1,2], [0,1], [1,1]]\n          - color: maroon (9)\n            initial_positions: [[0,2], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]\n            final_positions: [[2,2], [2,1], [0, 0], [1,0], [2,0]]\n      match: True\n  - example_4:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n      objects:\n        - color: red (2)\n          initial_positions: [[0,0], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]\n          final_positions: [[0,2], [2,1], [1, 0], [2,0]]\n        - color: white (0)\n          initial_positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1]]\n          final_positions: [[1,2], [2,2], [0,1], [1,1]]\n      match: False\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n2.  After rotation:\n    *   In Example 2: if there is a pixel that was at \\[2,0] it moves to \\[2,2].\n    *  In Example 4: if there is a pixel that was at \\[0,0] it moves to \\[0,2].\n\nIt seems the added rules are very specialized to the failing examples. It's better to consolidate these:\n\n1.  The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n2.  After the rotation the pixel in the lower left moves to the lower right.\n"
