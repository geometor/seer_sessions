The input grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow). The output grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 0 (white) and 5 (gray). The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears crucial. It seems the bottom row's colors in the input are changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
