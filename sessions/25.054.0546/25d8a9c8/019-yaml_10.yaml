facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [1, 2, 4]
    output_colors: [0, 5]
  - object: row_1
    type: grid_row
    input_pixels: [2, 2, 4]
    output_pixels: [0, 0, 0]
  - object: row_2
    type: grid_row
    input_pixels: [2, 2, 4]
    output_pixels: [0, 0, 0]
  - object: row_3
    type: grid_row
    input_pixels: [1, 1, 1]
    output_pixels: [5, 5, 5]
  - observation: "Rows 1 and 2 in the input grid, which contain 2s and 4s, become all 0s in the output."
  - observation: "Row 3 in the input grid, which contains 1s, becomes all 5s in the output."
  - transformation: "Input pixels of values other than 1 appear replaced with 0. All 1s are replaced by 5."
