Each pixel has a numerical value (0-9) representing a specific color. The transformation seems to involve changing the colors of the pixels based on some rule related to their original color or position. The output grid retains the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid. The most noticeable change is that all input colors are replaced by either white (0) or gray (5).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
