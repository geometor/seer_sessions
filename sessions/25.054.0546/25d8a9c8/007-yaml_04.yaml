objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values: [0-9] # Representing different colors

observations:
  - input_grid:
      - row_1: [7, 3, 3] # Orange, Green, Green
      - row_2: [6, 6, 6] # Magenta, Magenta, Magenta
      - row_3: [3, 7, 7] # Green, Orange, Orange
  - output_grid:
      - row_1: [0, 0, 0] # white, white, white
      - row_2: [5, 5, 5] # gray, gray, gray
      - row_3: [0, 0, 0] # white, white, white

transformations:
  - description: "Colors are changed based on an unknown rule."
  - input_colors: [7, 3, 6] # unique colors in the input
  - output_colors: [0, 5]   # unique colors in the output
  - specific_changes:
      - 7 -> 0   # Orange becomes white
      - 3 -> 0 # green becomes white
      - 6 -> 5   # Magenta becomes gray

relationships:
  - spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - color_mapping:  Each number corresponds to a distinct color.
