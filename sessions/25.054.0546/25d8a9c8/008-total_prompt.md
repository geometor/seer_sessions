## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 3 3
6 6 6
3 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03EFE0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03F130>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value (0-9) representing a specific color. The transformation seems to involve changing the colors of the pixels based on some rule related to their original color or position. The output grid retains the same dimensions (3x3) as the input grid. The most noticeable change is that all input colors are replaced by either white (0) or gray (5).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values: [0-9] # Representing different colors

observations:
  - input_grid:
      - row_1: [7, 3, 3] # Orange, Green, Green
      - row_2: [6, 6, 6] # Magenta, Magenta, Magenta
      - row_3: [3, 7, 7] # Green, Orange, Orange
  - output_grid:
      - row_1: [0, 0, 0] # white, white, white
      - row_2: [5, 5, 5] # gray, gray, gray
      - row_3: [0, 0, 0] # white, white, white

transformations:
  - description: "Colors are changed based on an unknown rule."
  - input_colors: [7, 3, 6] # unique colors in the input
  - output_colors: [0, 5]   # unique colors in the output
  - specific_changes:
      - 7 -> 0   # Orange becomes white
      - 3 -> 0 # green becomes white
      - 6 -> 5   # Magenta becomes gray

relationships:
  - spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - color_mapping:  Each number corresponds to a distinct color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to perform a color replacement. Examine the input grid. If a pixel is orange (7) or green (3), change it to white (0). If a pixel is magenta (6), change it to gray (5). All other colors, if any, remain unchanged, although, in this example, only these three colors are present. The position of the pixels within the grid does not appear to affect the color changes.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
