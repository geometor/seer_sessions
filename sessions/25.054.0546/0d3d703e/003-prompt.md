Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program takes a 3x3 grid of integers as input. Each integer in the input grid is incremented by 1. The resulting integers form the output 3x3 grid. The color mapping between input and output grid shows: input green becomes output yellow, input blue becomes output gray, and input red becomes output magenta. Each input value is increased by one to create each output value.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms a 3x3 grid by incrementing each integer by 1.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            # Increment the integer in the output by 1.
            output_grid[i, j] = (output_grid[i,j] + 1)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
