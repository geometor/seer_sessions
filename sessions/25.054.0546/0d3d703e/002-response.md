"""
The program takes a 3x3 grid of integers as input. Each integer in the input grid is incremented by 1. The resulting integers form the output 3x3 grid. The color mapping between input and output grid shows: input green becomes output yellow, input blue becomes output gray, and input red becomes output magenta. Each input value is increased by one to create each output value.
