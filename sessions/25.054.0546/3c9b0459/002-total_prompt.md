## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEFB00A0>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE558940>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions and a similar distribution of colors, but their positions are rearranged. The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid elements.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    relationship: input transforms to output
  - object: grid_elements
    properties:
      - color: derived from integer value
      - position: row and column index
    actions:
      - repositioned: elements change their row and column indices
  - transformation: spatial_rearrangement
    type: suspected rotation or reflection
    details: precise transformation rule needs to be determined
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

1.  **Identify** the input grid as a 3x3 matrix of colored pixels.
2.  **Rotate** the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This means:
    *   The element at input\[0][0] moves to output\[0][2].
    *   The element at input\[0][1] moves to output\[1][2].
    *    ... and so on
    *  The element at input\[2][2] moves to output\[0][0]

3.  **Produce** the resulting rotated grid as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
