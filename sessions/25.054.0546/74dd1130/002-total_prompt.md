## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFDC0>

**output:**
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC10>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed natural language program for the given input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   **Colors/Numbers:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: rotate
    type: transformation
    description: Rotates the grid elements.
    parameters:
        direction: clockwise # based on observation
        degrees: 90 # based on observation

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Each cell has a position within the grid (row, column).
  - type: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid through rotation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid of colored cells.
2.  The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  The rotated grid becomes the output.

In simple terms: Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise to get the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
