Okay, let's analyze the provided information and formulate a plan to address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focuses on mapping pixel coordinates between the input and output grids based on color. It attempts to find a corresponding output coordinate for each input pixel of the same color.  However, the provided test results are incomplete and contain `None` values. Thus I cannot yet determine a strategy for error resolution. The basic approach of the code seems reasonable as a starting point, however I still need to do further analysis to understand the task at hand.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Complete the Test Results:** I need to execute the provided code to get the complete information on the test results. This will include the input and output grids, whether it's a match, the number of pixels off, size correctness, color palette correctness, and if the pixel counts are correct.
2.  **Analyze Results:** Once the test results are obtained, I'll analyze the `coordinate_mapping` and `mismatched_pixels` to understand how the input is transformed to the output. This will help to refine the logic and rules governing the transformation.
3.  **Focus on Object Properties:** The task instructions and core knowledge priors point towards objects, shapes, and their properties being crucial. Therefore, I will pay close attention to contigous regions of the same color.

**Gather Metrics (using Code Execution):**

I'll use the provided code, execute it, and gather more meaningful metrics.
Here is the result of execution (and including some print formatting):

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a counter-clockwise rotation of the columns. The first column becomes the first row in reverse order, the second column becomes the second row in reverse order, and so on.

1.  Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2.  For each column, create a new row in the output grid.
3. Populate that row with elements from the input column in reversed order.
