"""
The transformation performs a specific permutation of the pixels within the 3x3 grid. It rotates the pixels in the top row and first column around the central pixel.
Specifically:
*   The pixel at the top-middle (0,1) moves to the left-middle position (1,0).
*   The pixel at the top-right (0,2) moves to the bottom-left position (2,0).
*   The pixel at the left-middle position(1,0) moves to top-middle (0,1)
*   The pixel at the bottom-left (2,0) moves to the top-right (0,2)
*   The pixel at the middle-right (1,2) moves to bottom-middle (2,1)
*   The pixel at the bottom-middle (2,1) moves to middle-right (1,2)
*   All other pixels, those at (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2), remain in their original positions.
