Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program described a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The code implemented this using `np.rot90(input_array, k=1)`.  However, the results across multiple examples show a consistent error: the rotation is *counter-clockwise*, not clockwise. The `k=1` argument in `np.rot90` actually performs a *counter-clockwise* rotation.  The solution is simple: we need to adjust the rotation direction.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Rotation Direction:** The core issue is the incorrect rotation direction. We will change the natural language program and will correct it by using either k=-1 or k=3.

2. **Reproducible reports**: improve the automated reporting of the example input/output pairs, including correct reporting on differences.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

Here's a refined analysis of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 3x3
    *   Rotation Direction: Incorrect (Counter-Clockwise)
    *   Pixel Differences Report (Expected vs. Transformed):
	```
	(0, 0) Expected: 2, Transformed: 1
	(0, 1) Expected: 1, Transformed: 1
	(0, 2) Expected: 5, Transformed: 2
	(2, 0) Expected: 2, Transformed: 5
	(2, 2) Expected: 1, Transformed: 2
	```

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 3x3
    *   Rotation Direction: Incorrect (Counter-Clockwise)
        *   Pixel Differences Report (Expected vs. Transformed):
	```
	(0, 0) Expected: 2, Transformed: 5
	(0, 2) Expected: 5, Transformed: 2
	(2, 0) Expected: 2, Transformed: 2
	(2, 2) Expected: 5, Transformed: 5
	```

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 3x3
    *   Rotation Direction: Incorrect (Counter-Clockwise)
    *    Pixel Differences Report (Expected vs. Transformed):
	```
	(0, 0) Expected: 9, Transformed: 5
	(0, 1) Expected: 9, Transformed: 8
	(0, 2) Expected: 5, Transformed: 9
	(2, 0) Expected: 9, Transformed: 5
	(2, 1) Expected: 5, Transformed: 5
	(2, 2) Expected: 5, Transformed: 9
	```

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 3x3
    *   Rotation Direction: Incorrect (Counter-Clockwise)
        *   Pixel Differences Report (Expected vs. Transformed):
	```
	(0, 0) Expected: 2, Transformed: 6
	(0, 1) Expected: 2, Transformed: 1
	(0, 2) Expected: 2, Transformed: 2
	(2, 1) Expected: 1, Transformed: 1
	```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3  # All examples are 3x3
      - elements: integers (representing colors)

actions:
  - name: rotate
    type: transformation
    properties:
      - direction: clockwise
      - angle: 90 degrees
      - input: grid
      - output: transformed grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The rotated grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
