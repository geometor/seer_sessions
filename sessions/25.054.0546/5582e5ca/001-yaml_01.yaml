task_description: >
  The task is to transform an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid
  of the same dimensions, where all pixels in the output grid have the same color,
  and the chosen color is present in the input grid.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

actions:
  - name: identify_most_common_color
    input: input_grid
    output: integer (color value)
    description: >
      Finds a color to use to fill output. In this example yellow (4) is
      selected.

  - name: fill_grid
    input:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (from input_grid)
      - fill_color: integer (output of identify_most_common_color)
    output: output_grid
    description: Creates a new grid filled entirely with the specified color.

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - output_grid's single color is derived from the input_grid.
