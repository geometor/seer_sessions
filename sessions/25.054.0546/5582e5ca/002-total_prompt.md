## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC10>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE589D50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid appears to consist of only one color, which is present in the input. The dimensions of the grid are 3x3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description: >
  The task is to transform an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid
  of the same dimensions, where all pixels in the output grid have the same color,
  and the chosen color is present in the input grid.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

actions:
  - name: identify_most_common_color
    input: input_grid
    output: integer (color value)
    description: >
      Finds a color to use to fill output. In this example yellow (4) is
      selected.

  - name: fill_grid
    input:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (from input_grid)
      - fill_color: integer (output of identify_most_common_color)
    output: output_grid
    description: Creates a new grid filled entirely with the specified color.

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - output_grid's single color is derived from the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid and identify a single color to use in the output. In the example provided, yellow (represented by the digit 4) is selected as the fill color.
2. **Determine Output Grid:** Create output using color (4) and shape of input
3.  **Fill Output:** Fill the entire output grid with the selected color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
