## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 3 8
4 4 4
8 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEFB00A0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
4 4 4
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single digits.  The most obvious change is that many of the colors in the input grid are replaced in the output grid. A specific color seems to be retained while others change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: colored pixels (represented by digits)
  - type: transformation
    input: grid
    output: grid
  - observation: color_retention
    details: "One color from the input grid is consistently present in the output grid."
  - observation: color_change
    details: "Colors other than the retained color change to a specific color."
  - specific_observation:
      input_color: 4 (yellow)
      output_color: 4 (yellow)
      location: center row
      status: retained
  - specific_observation:
      input_colors: [3(green), 8(azure), 1(blue)]
      output_color: 5 (gray)
      status: changed
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Retained Color:** Examine the input grid and find the color that makes up the entire middle row. This is the "retained color". In this example the middle row is yellow, represented by the digit '4'.

2.  **Change other colors:** all other digits in the grid will be replaced by the digit '5'.

3.  **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid. Fill any cell that was occupied by another color, to '5'. Transfer the middle row color to the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
