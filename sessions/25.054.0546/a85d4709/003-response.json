            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly simplistic. The original hypothesis focused only on the main diagonal (i=j) and a hardcoded set of replacements based on position. The provided examples reveal a more complex pattern where the entire output grid is filled with a repeating pattern of colors, regardless of the input values (except for 5 which appears to halt the pattern).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Ignore Input Values (Mostly):** The output grid's colors seem largely independent of the input grid, except for '5' values. We need to shift from modifying the input grid to generating a completely new output grid.\n2.  **Repeating Pattern:** Identify and implement the repeating 3x3 color pattern (3,3,3, 4,4,4, 2,2,2) or variants of it.\n3. **'5' as a Stopper:** Understand the role of the '5' (gray) pixel. The current tests indicate it may act as a \"stop\" signal for the pattern propagation, leaving remaining parts of the output row unchanged (filled with the value from the row above or initialized).\n4. **Edge Cases:** Be mindful of potential edge cases, particularly with various sizes. However, given these four examples, it seems consistent.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using observation, not code execution at this stage):**\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Input Colors | Output Colors | Key Observations                                                                                                        |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 3x3         | 3x3          | 0, 5          | 2, 3, 4         | Output is a diagonal gradient (3,4,2), filled across entire array. Input 5s are ignored, Output are all colored.                                                                |\n| 2       | 3x3         | 3x3          | 0, 5          | 3             | Output is entirely filled with '3'.  |\n| 3       | 3x3         | 3x3          | 0, 5          | 2, 4             | Output appears as two lines of color '2', with one of color '4'. |\n| 4       | 3x3         | 3x3          | 0, 5          | 3,4     | Output starts with color 4, then 3, the 4 again.     |\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: 3\n      columns: 3\n      colors: [0, 5]  # Varies per example, but these are the only colors present\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: 3\n      columns: 3\n      colors: [2, 3, 4] # Varies, but this is the superset\n  - name: gray_pixel #object that stops the transformation\n    type: pixel\n    properties:\n      value: 5\n      role: stopper\n\nactions:\n  - name: generate_pattern\n    description: Creates a repeating color pattern in the output grid.\n    parameters:\n      pattern: [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2] #The core pattern, this seems to be altered based on the initial conditions, may be better to start from different points in the array.\n      start_row: 0\n      start_col: 0\n  - name: stop_at_gray\n    description: Halts pattern generation at the position of a '5' in the input grid.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Pattern Generation:**\n    *   Begin filling the `output_grid` with the repeating sequence `3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2`. Start at `output_grid[0][0]`.\n    *   Iterate row by row, then column by column.\n3.  **Gray Stopper:** If a '5' is encountered in the *input* grid at the *corresponding* position, stop the pattern propagation for the *current row* in the output grid. Maintain current value for the rest of the row.\n4. **Wrap if Necessary**: If a row does not have a `5` in it, then use the entire pattern sequence, wrapping as necessary.\n\nRevised Natural Language Program:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Iterate:** Go through each cell of the *input* grid, row by row, and column by column.\n3.  **Check for 5:** In the *input* grid, if the current cell is a '5', copy this '5' to the same position in the *output* grid.\n4. **Apply Pattern:** If not a `5` in the *input*, use a repeating pattern for the *output* grid. The pattern depends on the row:\n    *   Row 0: Start with '3'. Repeating sequence: 3.\n    *   Row 1: Start with '4', if there were no `5` in the previous row, otherwise '3'. Repeating sequence starts from the value.\n    *   Row 2: Start with '2', if there were no `5` in the previous row, otherwise, starts with the value of the second item. Repeating sequence starts from the value.\n5. Fill the output using values of color:\n      * If the first row, fill all '3'.\n      * if the second row, fill all '4'.\n      * If the third row, fill all '2'.\n\nEssentially, the gray pixels (`5`) in the *input* act as a pass through to the *output* grid. All of the `0` are replaced in the output with values from a simple, row based sequence.\n"
