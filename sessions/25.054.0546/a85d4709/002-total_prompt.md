## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03EFE0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE5FDE40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the digits 0 and 5, while the output grid contains the digits 2, 3, and 4. The spatial arrangement of elements seems crucial, as is the replacement of specific input values with specific output values. The use of color in the images, represented numerically in the grid, is essential.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer value
      - position: row and column index

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: replace values in input grid to produce output grid

relationships:
  - input_value: 0
    output_value: varies, (3 or 4 or 2)
    context: diagonal position from top left determines the mapping
  - input_value: 5
    output_value: varies, see above

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Observe the 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Value Replacement:**
    *   If a cell in the input grid has a value of 5 (gray), it's ignored (skip).
    *   If a cell has a value of 0 (white)
        *   If the 0 is on a top-left to bottom-right diagonal, change it to 3, 4 or 2.
        *  Specifically, if the zero value is at location 0,0 (top-left) change it to 3.
         *  Specifically, if the zero value is at location 1,1 (middle-center) change it to 4.
         *  Specifically, if the zero value is at location 2,2 (bottom-right) change it to 2.

Essentially the transformation appears to replace all the 0 values, based on position, and ignoring the 5 values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
