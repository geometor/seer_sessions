## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBD1FC520>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x737FBD1FD7E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The grid contains two colors: gray (5) and white (0). The output is a single number, 2, shown as a red (2) background. It appears the task involves counting something within the input grid. The output value '2' might represent a count related to specific colored regions, their shapes, or positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: gray
        value: 5
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (1,1)]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
  - type: integer
    value: 2
    color: red

actions:
  - type: count
    target: "specific object features in input grid"

relationships:
  - input_grid: "contains gray and white pixels"
  - output_integer: "represents a derived count based on the grid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program counts the number of separate white (0) regions in the input grid. A region is defined as one or more connected white squares.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Identify white pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with a value of 0.
2. **Define region:** White cells that share an edge (up, down, left, or right - not diagonally) belong to one group/region.
3.  **Count regions:** Count the number of distinct white regions by grouping together adjacent white pixels.
4.  **Output:** The output is the total count of these distinct white regions.

In the specific example:

-   There are four white pixels.
-   The white pixels at (0,1) and (1,2) are adjacent (share a common edge). So it counts as ONE region.
-   The white pixels at (1, 0) and (2, 1) are adjacent (share a common edge). So it counts as ONE region.
-    The two regions are not adjacent (no connection at all).
-   Therefore, there are two distinct white regions. The program output is 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
