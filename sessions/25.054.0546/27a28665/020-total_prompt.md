## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 1 1
0 1 1
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC10>

**output:**
```
3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x737FBF03F130>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors (0 for white and 1 for blue).  The output is a single numerical digit, `3`, inside a box/grid colored with value of the number `3`, green. The core task appears to be counting something within the input grid. Given prior knowledge, that 0 and 1 usually stand for on or off, and boolean logic, it's likely we are counting number of blue pixels (or pixels of value `1`).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [0, 1] # white, blue
      element_type: integer

  - object: output_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      value: 3

  - relation: count_of
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_value
    property: 'number of cells with value 1'

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid (2D array) of integers, where each integer represents a color.
2.  **Count:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3.  **Check Value:** For each cell, check if its value is equal to 1 (blue color).
4.  **Increment:** If the cell's value is 1, increment a counter.
5.  **Output:** The final value of the counter after iterating through all cells is the output. The output is placed in a single grid of same value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
