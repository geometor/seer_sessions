observations:
  - task: Count orthogonally connected white regions.
  - input_type: 2D grid of integers (0-9).
  - output_type: 1x1 grid containing a single integer.
  - objects:
      - name: white_region
        description: A group of orthogonally connected white (0) pixels.
        properties:
          - connectivity: orthogonal (up, down, left, right)
  - actions:
      - name: count_regions
        description: Count the number of distinct white regions.
        method: Depth-First Search (DFS) or similar connected component labeling.
  - constraints:
      - Only orthogonal connections define a region. Diagonal connections are ignored.
      - output_grid_size: always a 1x1 grid, with the value set to the count.
