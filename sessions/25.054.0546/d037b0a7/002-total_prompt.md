## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC70>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE588F40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing different colors. The transformation appears to involve some kind of propagation or filling of values, specifically relating to the non-zero digits. It's not a simple rotation, reflection, or arithmetic operation on the entire grid. The spatial relationship between the colored pixels seems crucial.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    element_type: color_codes
  - object: non_zero_pixels
    property: value (color)
    action: propagate_value
    condition: propagation_direction_and_limit
  - object: zero_pixels
    property: value (white)
    action: replaced_by_non_zero_value
    condition: proximity_to_non_zero_pixels
  - observation: propagation from top right
    details: magenta (6) propagates down and left, filling cells.
  - observation: propagation fills
    details:  yellow (4) fills downwards, and green(3) does not propogate

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Find the pixel with the value 6 (magenta) in the input grid.
2.  **Magenta Propagation:**  Propagate the value '6' downwards and to the left, replacing any '0' (white) pixels encountered. Stop propagation in a direction when a non-zero pixel is met.
3. **Yellow propogation** Propogate the value '4' downwards.
4. Ignore other non-zero pixels.

In simpler terms - start at the top right non-zero element, copy it downwards and left, and stop when hitting any other color and propogate '4' down.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
