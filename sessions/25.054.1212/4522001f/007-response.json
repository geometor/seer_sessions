The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and green (3). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input, primarily featuring white (0) and green (3) pixels. The red pixel (2) in the input seems to disappear or is not maintained in the output, while Green color area is selected to perform the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
