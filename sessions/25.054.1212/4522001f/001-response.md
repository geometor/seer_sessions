Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The primary color involved appears to be green (value 3), with some instances of red (value 2) and white (value 0). The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with the color green playing a dominant role. The original shape and size of non-white and non-red objects in the input grid is replicated.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 9x9.
  - observation: Input grid contains green, red, and white pixels.
  - observation: Output grid contains only green and white pixels.
  - object: Green object
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: contiguous block
    actions:
      - expanded: Replicated and expanded in the output grid.
  - object: Red object
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: single pixel
    actions:
       - removed: Not present in the output
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are 3x the input grid dimensions.
  - relationship: Green objects in the input is expanded and fills the relative same position and shape in output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is 3 times the width and 3 times the height of the input grid.
2.  **Green Expansion:** Identify all pixels with a value of 3 (green) in the input grid.
3.  **Replication:** For each identified set of adjecent green pixel:
    *   Replicate this shape of green pixels in the output grid.
    *   Position in the output grid is multiplied by 3
4. Fill rest of the output grid by 0 (white color)

In essence, the program takes the original shape of all the adjacent green color pixels, and expands it by the scale, positioning it to the multiplied coordinates.
