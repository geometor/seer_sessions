Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies connected shapes in the input grid and expand the shape formed by this connected set of same color pixels. Each identified shape is expanded by a factor of 3. Pixels in the input that are not part of these identified objects are not included in the output. The output grid dimensions are 3x the input grid. The expanded shape in the output is positioned by scaling the original bounding box by a factor of three.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
