## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 3
0 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93F40>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC48A63190>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (9x9). The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and green (3). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input, primarily featuring white (0) and green (3) pixels. The red pixel (2) in the input seems to disappear or is not maintained in the output, while Green color area is selected to perform the transformation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2, 3]  # white, red, green
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 9x9
      colors: [0, 3] #white, green
  - objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: (rows, cols)
          - cells:  2D array of color values
  - transformations:
    - type: expansion, replacement
    - details: >
        The input grid is expanded.
        The green (3) color in input grid is preserved and replicated to form quadrants in the output grid, while the red is removed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Green Region:** Locate the connected region of green (3) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Expansion and Replication:** Create the base of a 9 x 9 output grid.

3. **Fill output:** The input is scaled and filled with green pixels in areas derived from coordinates where they are green in input

4. **Fill rest:** All other output coordinates are filled with white background.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
