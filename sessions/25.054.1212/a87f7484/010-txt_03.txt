Example 1 Analysis:
- Input Grid: [Provided Input Grid Here]
- Expected Output Grid: [Provided Expected Output Grid Here]
- Transformed Output Grid: [Output of transform(input_grid)]
- Match: True/False (overall match between transformed and expected)
- Pixels Off:  [(row1, col1, expected_color1, actual_color1), (row2, col2, ...), ...]
- Size Correct: True/False
- Object Differences: (If applicable)
  - Object 1:  Size difference, position difference, etc.
  - Object 2: ...
