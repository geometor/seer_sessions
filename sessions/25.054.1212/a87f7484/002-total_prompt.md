## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 0 6
0 6 6
6 0 6
4 0 4
0 4 4
4 0 4
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7BFC48909C90>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F937C0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed natural language program for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 9x3 grid of colored pixels. Colors include magenta (6), white (0), yellow (4), and azure (8). There are distinct rectangular blocks of magenta, yellow, and azure, all surrounding a white pixel in their centers.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid, which appears to be a cropped section of the input. Specifically, it's the azure (8) block from the bottom of the input grid, including the central white (0) pixel.
*    the output is a subset of the input
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific colored block (azure, in this instance) and extracting it. The criterion for selection of the block seems that, if a block has other blocks above it, only the lowest is selected.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_type: grid
  - input_dimensions: 9x3
  - input_colors: [6, 0, 4, 8]
  - output_type: grid
  - output_dimensions: 3x3
  - output_colors: [8, 0]
  - relationship: output_is_subset_of_input
  - object_1:
      color: 6
      shape: rectangle
      dimensions: 3x3
      attribute: "top block"
  - object_2:
      color: 4
      shape: rectangle
      dimensions: 3x3
       attribute: "middle block"
  - object_3:
      color: 8
      shape: rectangle
      dimensions: 3x3
      attribute: "bottom block"
  - operation: extract_object
  - criteria:
      color: 8
      position: bottom
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify all contiguous rectangular blocks of pixels with the same color. Note there are always 3 3x3 blocks stacked in the same position.
2. **Locate Bottom Block:** Of the blocks identified, locate any block that has other blocks above it.
3.  **Extract Block:** Extract the located block.
4.  **Output:** The extracted block is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
