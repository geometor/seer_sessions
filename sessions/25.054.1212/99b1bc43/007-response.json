The input grid appears to contain distinct sections of different colors (blue, white, yellow, red). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, with a single color (green) highlighting certain cells and the rest being white. The spatial relationship between the colored sections in the input seems to be somehow encoded in the positions of the green cells in the output. Specifically the output seems to be a quarter section on the original grid, and taking only non zero, non-white values that form corners.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
