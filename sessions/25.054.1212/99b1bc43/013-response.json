The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed and simplified version, primarily using only two colors: white (0) and green (3). The input grid appears to be divided into distinct regions or blocks of different colors. The output grid's dimensions (4x4) are significantly smaller than the input grid's dimensions (9x4). There is an apparent relationship between regions of color in the input grid, and the color and position of pixels in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Ignore any rows which aren't a part of the original blocks - in effect, discarding any rows that extend past the largest multiple of the block size.\n\n2. **Reduce:** the original input grid in effect is reduced to blocks of 2x2.\n\n3.  **Map and Transform Colors**:\n  *   Iterate through each 2x2 block in the reduced input grid.\n  *   If the 2x2 block contains any blue (1) pixels, replace the entire 2x2 section with a single green (3) pixel in the output_grid.\n  *   If the 2x2 block contains any yellow (4) pixels, replace the entire 2x2 block with a single green (3) pixel in the output grid at the correspoding position.\n  *    If the 2x2 block contains any red (2) pixels, replace the entire 2x2 block with a single green (3) pixel in the output grid.\n  *   If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., the 2x2 block contains only white (0) pixels, replace the entire 2x2 block section with a single white (0) pixel in the output grid\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is a 4x4 grid, a result of condensing and color-transforming the input into corresponding 2x2 blocks.\n\nEssentially, the output is generated by the appearance of specific digits(colors) within 2x2 blocks of the input grid. The color mapping for the final result of 3 only occurs if that section contains 1, 2, or 4. If not it results in 0.\n"
