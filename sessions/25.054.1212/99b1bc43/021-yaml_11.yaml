observations:
  - object_types:
      - grid: "2D array of pixels"
      - region: "contiguous block of pixels with the same color"
      - subgrid: "4x4 section of the grid"
  - properties:
      - color: "integer value representing a specific color (0-9)"
      - size: "dimensions of a grid or region (height, width)"
      - position: "coordinates of a pixel or the bounding box of a region"
      - bounding_box: "the smallest rectangle enclosing a region"
  - actions:
      - consolidate: "replace multiple colors with a single color (green/3)"
      - reduce: "create smaller grid"
      - position: "place the subgrid within the fixed size grid"
  - input_output_relationship:
      - size_fixed: "output grid is always 4x4"
      - color_consolidation: "all non-zero colors in the input, except 0, are replaced by 3 (green) in the output"
      - position_variable: "the position and arrangement of green blocks in the output is NOT fixed and depends on the input"
      - zero_regions: "the white (0) pixels act as separators between regions of other colors"
  - errors:
      - positioning_logic: "The current code's logic for positioning the green blocks is incorrect; it doesn't adapt to the input structure."
