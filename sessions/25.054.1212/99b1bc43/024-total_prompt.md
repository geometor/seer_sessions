"""
1.  **Consolidate Colors:** Replace all non-zero color values (except 0) in the input grid with the color green (3).
2.  **Fixed Output Size:** The output grid is always a 4x4 grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the color consolidation (non-zero to green) and the fixed output size (4x4), it failed to accurately capture the spatial relationships between the input and output. The code essentially copies the top-left 4x4 section of the input, replacing non-zero values with '3', but it doesn't consider how the input is conceptually "compressed" or summarized into the 4x4 output. The "Relative Positioning" concept was misinterpreted; it's not about direct pixel-to-pixel mapping from the input's top-left corner, but more about preserving *presence* and relative arrangement of colored regions within a condensed representation. The previous code essentially took a "snapshot" of the top-left corner. Instead we need an overview.

The strategy is to determine the "overview" or "presence" of a color, specifically how to represent sections/quadrants of the larger grid, in the smaller one.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

To analyze this better, I need to understand, quantitatively, *where* color appears in the input and how that relates to the output. I will create a way to get the bounding box for each color region. I can then compare this to the expected output. I'll refer to the non-zero colors collectively for now.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_color_extents(grid):
    """
    Finds the bounding box for non-zero colors in the grid.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are colors and values are (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) tuples.
        Returns an empty dictionary if no non-zero colors are found.
    """
    color_extents = {}
    rows, cols = np.where(grid != 0)
    if len(rows) > 0:
        min_row, max_row = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)
        min_col, max_col = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)
        color_extents[1] = (min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col) #color is essentially irrelevant
    return color_extents

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes a single example and returns relevant metrics."""
    input_extents = get_color_extents(input_grid)
    expected_extents = get_color_extents(expected_output)
    transformed_extents = get_color_extents(transformed_output)

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Consolidate Colors:**  All non-zero colored pixels in the input grid are treated as a single color group (conceptually, "colored").

2.  **Determine Color Extent:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the "colored" pixels in the input grid.  This defines the overall area where color is present.

3.  **Divide into Quadrants (Implicitly):** The key insight here is that the input grid is *not* divided into fixed 4x4 quadrants.  Instead, we're interested in whether color exists *anywhere* within regions relative to the overall color extent.  We implicitly divide the *colored area* into quadrants based on its bounding box.

4.  **Presence Mapping (4x4 Output):** Create a 4x4 output grid initialized with all zeros (white). For each cell in the 4x4 output, determine if any "colored" pixels exist in the corresponding quadrant of the input's *colored area*. If color is present in that quadrant, set the output cell to green (3); otherwise, leave it as white (0). "Corresponding Quadrant" means dividing input rows/cols by (color extent height/4) and (color extent width/4), not by fixed amounts.
   - Divide input_height / 4 = quadrant_height_scale.
   - Divide input_width / 4 = quadrant_width_scale.
   - input cell row, col maps to output[row // quadrant_height_scale, col // quadrant_width_scale]

5. **Output:** The resulting 4x4 grid represents the presence of color in the input, compressed into a 4x4 representation.

The crucial difference from the previous attempt is the implicit quadrant division based on the *extent of color*, not fixed grid boundaries, and representing the *presence* of any non-zero input color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
