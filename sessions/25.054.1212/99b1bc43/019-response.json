There's a significant reduction in size from input to output. The input contains three distinct regions of blue, yellow, and red squares respectively, separated by white rows and columns. The output appears to consolidate certain colors, while white/0 values are preserved to separate regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Form the output grid using a subgrid.\n\n4. **Position**:\n    The green colored area (3 x 3) composed of value '3' form a subgrid inside a 4x4 grid.\n    The empty area are composed of value '0'.\n    The area occupied by '3's are\n        - rows 0 and 3: cells 0 and 1\n        - rows 1 and 2: cells 1 and 2\n\n5.  **Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid based on the reduction and consolidation.
