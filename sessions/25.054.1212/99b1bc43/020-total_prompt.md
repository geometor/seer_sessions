## Example 4

**input:**
```
1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1
4 4 4 4
0 2 2 2
0 2 2 2
2 0 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC47584DC0>

**output:**
```
3 3 0 0
0 3 3 0
0 3 3 3
3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC47587F10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input appears to be a grid of colored squares (represented by single-digit integers), and the output is a smaller, different grid, also of colored squares. There's a significant reduction in size from input to output. The input contains three distinct regions of blue, yellow, and red squares respectively, separated by white rows and columns. The output appears to consolidate certain colors, while white/0 values are preserved to separate regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x4 (rows x columns)
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]  # white, blue, red, yellow
    observations:
      - distinct_regions: Three colored regions (blue, yellow, red) are separated by white (0) rows and columns.
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [0, 3] # white, green
    observations:
      - color_mapping:  Blue, Yellow and Red regions in input map to a green region in the output.
      - size_reduction: The output is a smaller grid. White colored pixels are retained at new positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into distinct regions based on contiguous blocks of the same color. White (0) acts as a separator. The regions identified are Blue, Yellow and Red.

2.  **Consolidate Color:** Replace all Blue, Yellow and Red colors with the color Green (3).

3.  **Reduce Size**: Take the consolidated colors. Form the output grid using a subgrid.

4. **Position**:
    The green colored area (3 x 3) composed of value '3' form a subgrid inside a 4x4 grid.
    The empty area are composed of value '0'.
    The area occupied by '3's are
        - rows 0 and 3: cells 0 and 1
        - rows 1 and 2: cells 1 and 2

5.  **Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid based on the reduction and consolidation. The '0' values in the input separate regions. They are preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
