            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. While it captured some aspects of the transformation (processing 2-row sections, handling all-0/1 sections), it failed to accurately model the color changes and the row-specific logic. The primary issue is the incorrect assumption of how rows combine and influence the output. The strategy needs to incorporate the inter-row dependencies for generating output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Row Interactions:** The current program treats the 2-row sections, and row five separately, and the last four rows together. The results, however show that different pairing and row combinations matter. It is not possible to derive output based only on local features.\n2.  **Refine Color Logic:** The program doesn't determine the color of the output correctly.\n3.  **Iterative Updates:** Update the natural language program and code incrementally, testing against *all* examples after each change. Focus on getting one example right at a time, then ensuring existing examples still work.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere is the re-formatted result table. I am calculating a 'matching pixels' and a 'non-matching' to clarify the report.\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Matching Pixels | Non-Matching Pixels | Size Correct | Color Palette Correct |\n| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |\n| 1       | (9, 4)      | (4, 4)       | 14              | 2                   | True         | True                  |\n| 2       | (9, 4)      | (4, 4)       | 8               | 8                   | True         | True                  |\n| 3       | (9, 4)      | (4, 4)       | 8               | 8                   | True         | True                  |\n| 4       | (9, 4)      | (4, 4)       | 9               | 7                  | True         | True                  |\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    shape: (9, 4)\n    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors\n    notes: Represents the initial state.\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    shape: (4, 4)\n    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors\n    notes: Represents the transformed state.\n\n  - object: row_sections\n    type: list\n    elements: 2D arrays\n    notes: Input grid is conceptually divided into 2-row sections, plus a single row(row5) section, plus two 2-row section.\n  - action: check_color_uniformity\n    description: Examines color composition within the 2-row input_grid, and output row sections.\n    outcomes:\n        - if all pixels within a row are the same, including when they are all zero.\n        - if there is a mixture of non-zero colors\n        - if an entire sub-grid is a mixture of zeros and ones.\n  - action: set output rows:\n    description: setting the output row with either white, green or another color\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** A 9x4 grid of integers (0-9) representing colors.\n2.  **Output:** A 4x4 grid of integers, derived as follows:\n3.  **Process in Sections:** Divide the input grid into four sections:\n    *   Section 1: Rows 1 & 2\n    *   Section 2: Rows 3 & 4\n    *   Section 3: Row 5\n    *   Section 4: Rows 6 & 7\n    *   Section 5: Rows 8 & 9\n4.  **Output Row Generation:**\n    *   **Output Row 1:**\n        * if either Section 1 or Section 2 has *any* non-zero, non-one value, the entire row is green.\n        *   Otherwise, the row is composed of the pixel-wise XOR of the two rows.\n    *   **Output Row 2:**\n        * if either Section 1 or Section 2 has *any* non-zero, non-one value, the entire row is green.\n        *   Otherwise, the row is composed of the pixel-wise XOR of the two rows.\n    *   **Output Row 3:** If Row 5 contains all the same non-zero color, the output row is all green.\n    *   **Output Row 4**\n      * if either Section 4 or Section 5 has *any* non-zero, non-one value, the entire row is green.\n      * Otherwise, the row is composed of the pixel-wise XOR of the two rows from Section 4.\n\n5. **XOR rule:** When an output row must derive by using pixel-wise xor, do the following:\n  *  if the two pixel have the same value, use 0\n  *  otherwise, if there is a non-zero value, pick one color by cycling through the available\n      colors (not white)\n  * otherwise, if the colors are zero and one, use zero.\n\n"
