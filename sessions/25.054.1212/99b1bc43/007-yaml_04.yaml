facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than the output grid.
  - dimensions:
      input: 9x4
      output: 4x4
  - input_colors:
      - blue (1)
      - white (0)
      - yellow (4)
      - red (2)
  - output_colors:
      - green (3)
      - white (0)
  - object_input: Input grid is divided into colored regions.
  - object_output: output is likely showing corners of the colored regions, where the corner color is not white
  - spatial_relationship: Output grid corresponds to a condensed, possibly structurally-representative version of the input.
  - action: derive the output from corners of colored sections
