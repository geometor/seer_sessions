## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
4 4 4 4
0 2 0 2
0 0 0 2
2 0 0 2
2 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC4890A4A0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 3 3
3 3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC47F93CD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid seems to be a simplified or summarized version of the input.  The colors in the input don't seem to directly map to the output, but there is some kind of spatial relationship. It looks like blocks of the input collapse into single cells.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 4
      - height: 9
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 2, 4]  # Unique color values
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 4

actions:
  - name: compress
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The input grid is divided into subgrids, which are then represented by a single cell in the output grid.
    parameters:
        - name: subgrid_height
          value: 2

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a spatially compressed representation of the input grid. input rows are reduced by about half
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into horizontal subgrids. The first subgrid is the first two rows. The second subgrid are rows 3 and 4, and so on.

2. **Evaluate:**
    If a sub-grid contains colors other than white (0), output a new row. Check if any subgrid consists of all pixels of the same non-zero color.

3.  **Subgrid replacement:**
    The first two subgrids contain the same colors, and are changed to white in the output.
    Subgrid 3 had only yellow and becomes a row of solid green.
    The fourth two subgrids have pixels colored with red and white and become a subgrid in the third row of solid green.

In summary:
- The first 4 rows map to all white
- row 5 maps to green, green, green, green
- Rows 6 & 7 map to green, green, green, green

The input grid of 9 rows and 4 columns is transformed into an output grid of 4 rows x 4 columns by:
1. Taking sections of the input of 2 rows at a time.
2. If a 2-row section only contains 0s (and 1s), it's output is white.
3.  If an input row is all the same non-zero color, it becomes all green.
4. Two rows of mixed 0 and non-zero become all green


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
