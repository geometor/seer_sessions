Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into distinct regions based on contiguous blocks of the same color. White (0) acts as a separator. The regions identified are Blue, Yellow and Red.

2.  **Consolidate Color:** Replace all Blue, Yellow and Red colors with the color Green (3).

3.  **Reduce Size**: Take the consolidated colors. Form the output grid using a subgrid.

4. **Position**:
    The green colored area (3 x 3) composed of value '3' form a subgrid inside a 4x4 grid.
    The empty area are composed of value '0'.
    The area occupied by '3's are
        - rows 0 and 3: cells 0 and 1
        - rows 1 and 2: cells 1 and 2

5.  **Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid based on the reduction and consolidation. The '0' values in the input separate regions. They are preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
