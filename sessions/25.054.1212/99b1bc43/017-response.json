            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly simplistic. While it correctly identified the 2x2 block processing, it failed to accurately capture the nuanced mirroring and conditional color transformation logic. The core issue is that the mirroring described does not appear to exist, and the conditional coloring, while partially correct, is applied incorrectly and is missing some crucial details. The output size is related to the input size, so discard is not appropriate. The program needs significant revision to incorporate a more accurate understanding of the pattern and its relationship. The 4x4 output block for each 2x2 input block does not appear to correct. Instead, the output is the same size as the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples, not just the first, to identify the *actual* transformation rule. Pay close attention to the relationship between the 2x2 input blocks and the corresponding output pixels.\n2.  **Discard Incorrect Assumptions:** The mirroring concept and 4x4 output blocks appear to be incorrect, as is the \"discard extra rows\". Refocus on a more direct mapping.\n3.  **Precise Conditional Logic:** Determine the exact conditions under which colors change and how they map from input to output. The current implementation seems to have the general concept of a \"trigger,\" but applies it incorrectly by applying the change to a larger area than needed.\n4.  **Output Size:** re-evalute the size of the output grid.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** After revising the natural language program and code, test *all* examples again. Repeat this process until the code correctly transforms all training inputs to their expected outputs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**\n\nI will use direct observation of provided data, no coding.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x8\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Observations:\n        *   The top-left 2x2 input `[[0, 1], [0, 0]]` maps to output `[0, 0]`.\n        *   The 2x2 input `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]` maps to `[0, 0]`\n        *   The 2x2 input `[[1, 0], [0, 0]]` maps to `[0, 3]`\n        *   The 2x2 input `[[4, 4], [0, 2]]` maps to `[3, 3]`\n        *  Output width and height is half of the input, discarding remainders.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x8\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Observations:\n        *   The top-left 2x2 input `[[1, 1], [1, 0]]` maps to output `[3, 0]`.\n        *  Output width and height is half of the input, discarding remainders.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x8\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Observations:\n        *   The top-left 2x2 input `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` maps to output `[0, 3]`.\n        *  Output width and height is half of the input, discarding remainders.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x8\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Observations:\n        *   The top-left 2x2 input `[[1, 0], [0, 0]]` maps to output `[3, 3]`.\n        *  Output width and height is half of the input, discarding remainders.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: variable (1-30)\n      columns: variable (1-30)\n      cells: integers (0-9)\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: floor(input_rows / 2)\n      columns: floor(input_cols / 2)\n      cells: integers (0-9)\n  - object: 2x2_block\n    type: subgrid\n    properties:\n      origin: top-left corner of a 2x2 section of input_grid\n      cells: integers (0-9)\n  - action: divide_into_blocks\n    input: input_grid\n    process: Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.\n  - action: transform_block\n    input: 2x2_block\n    process:  Map the 2x2 block from the input grid to a single pixel in the output grid based on color presence.\n  - action: set_output_pixel\n    input: transformed_block_value\n    process: Place the transformed value in the corresponding output grid cell.\n  - rule: color_transformation\n    condition: If a 2x2 block contains the color blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4)\n    action: Output pixel is green (3)\n    else: Output pixel is 0.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks.  Ignore any leftover rows or columns if the dimensions are odd.\n2.  **Reduce:** Each 2x2 block in the input grid corresponds to *one* pixel in the output grid. The row and column of the output pixel are half the row and column of the 2x2 block's top-left corner (using integer division).\n3.  **Conditional Color Mapping:**\n    *   If the 2x2 input block contains *any* blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4) pixel, the corresponding output pixel is green (3).\n    *   Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).\n\nThis revised natural language program should provide a far more accurate description of the task and guide the creation of a working Python function.\n"
