Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The core elements are:

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x6 grid, also of single-digit integers (colors).  It appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input grid.
*   **Colors:**  Each number corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the system prompt's `COLOR_MAP`).
*   **Scaling:** The output grid's dimensions are double that of the input grid (3x3 becomes 6x6).
*   **Mirroring/Reflection:** The pattern in the output grid suggests a mirroring effect, both horizontally and vertically.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    property: color_coded
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9)
    property: color_coded
  - relationship: output_grid_is_scaled_mirror_of_input_grid
    factor: 2
    mirroring: horizontal_and_vertical
  - action: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    operation: scale_and_mirror
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scale Up:**  Double the dimensions of the input grid.  This means each single pixel in the input will become a 2x2 block of pixels in the output.

2.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Copy each row of the input and append a mirrored copy of the same row.

3. **Mirror Vertically** Copy each colum of the input and append a mirrored copy of the same column.

4.  **Maintain Color:** Ensure each pixel's original color (represented by its integer value) is preserved during the scaling and mirroring. In the expanded 2x2 blocks, all four pixels should have the same color as the original input pixel.
