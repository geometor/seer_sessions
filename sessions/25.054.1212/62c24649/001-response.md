Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The core elements appear to be:

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x6 grid, which seems to be an expansion of the input grid.
*   **Colors:** The values in the grids correspond to specific colors (e.g., 0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green).
*   **Expansion:** The output grid appears to be a doubled version of the input, with a one-pixel border.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 3
        color: green
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
      - value: 1
        color: blue

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - value: derived from input, doubled and with a one pixel border
        color: various
  - object: input_grid_pixels
    properties:
        shape: dynamic
        color: dynamic
  - action: input grid is expanded
    properties:
        type: duplication
        border added: 1 pixel

  - relationship: output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
    transformation: expansion and bordering
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Duplicate:** Take the original input grid and double its dimensions, both horizontally and vertically. Each original pixel becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
2.  **Create Border:** Add a one-pixel border around the duplicated grid. The pixel colors of this border are a copy of edge values of the *original* input.

Essentially, the transformation involves expanding the original input grid, turning a single cell in the input into 2x2 cells, and adding a border, padding the image, using the edges of the *original* input.
