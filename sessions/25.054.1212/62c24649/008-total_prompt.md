## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 3 1
1 3 0
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>

**output:**
```
3 3 1 1 3 3
1 3 0 0 3 1
0 2 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 2 0
1 3 0 0 3 1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The core elements are:

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x6 grid, also of single-digit integers (colors).  It appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input grid.
*   **Colors:**  Each number corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the system prompt's `COLOR_MAP`).
*   **Scaling:** The output grid's dimensions are double that of the input grid (3x3 becomes 6x6).
*   **Mirroring/Reflection:** The pattern in the output grid suggests a mirroring effect, both horizontally and vertically.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    property: color_coded
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9)
    property: color_coded
  - relationship: output_grid_is_scaled_mirror_of_input_grid
    factor: 2
    mirroring: horizontal_and_vertical
  - action: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    operation: scale_and_mirror
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scale Up:**  Double the dimensions of the input grid.  This means each single pixel in the input will become a 2x2 block of pixels in the output.

2.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Copy each row of the input and append a mirrored copy of the same row.

3. **Mirror Vertically** Copy each colum of the input and append a mirrored copy of the same column.

4.  **Maintain Color:** Ensure each pixel's original color (represented by its integer value) is preserved during the scaling and mirroring. In the expanded 2x2 blocks, all four pixels should have the same color as the original input pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
