The core elements are:\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 6x6 grid, also of single-digit integers (colors).  It appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input grid.\n*   **Colors:**  Each number corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the system prompt's `COLOR_MAP`).\n*   **Scaling:** The output grid's dimensions are double that of the input grid (3x3 becomes 6x6).\n*   **Mirroring/Reflection:** The pattern in the output grid suggests a mirroring effect, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This means each single pixel in the input will become a 2x2 block of pixels in the output.\n\n2.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Copy each row of the input and append a mirrored copy of the same row.\n\n3. **Mirror Vertically** Copy each colum of the input and append a mirrored copy of the same column.\n\n4.  **Maintain Color:** Ensure each pixel's original color (represented by its integer value) is preserved during the scaling and mirroring. In the expanded 2x2 blocks, all four pixels should have the same color as the original input pixel.\n"
