## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 0 0
0 2 0 0
2 2 0 2
0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x320 at 0x7BFC48DA7D90>

**output:**
```
2 2 0 0
0 2 0 0
2 2 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x320 at 0x7BFC47579240>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are red (2) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a very specific, localized change: a single red (2) pixel changes to blue (1). The location of this change appears to be related to the position of other red pixels. Specifically it is in the lower right of a set of four 2s in a square.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x4 (rows x columns)
      elements: pixels
      colors: [red, white, blue]
      color_codes:
        red: 2
        white: 0
        blue: 1

  - type: pixel
    properties:
       color:
         - red
         - white
         - blue
       position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: pixel
    precondition:
      color: red
      position_context: "part of a 2x2 red square"
    postcondition:
       color: blue
       position_same: True
    specifics:
        - old_color: 2
          new_color: 1
          location: "lower right pixel of a 2x2 square of red pixels"

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
     elements:
        - pixel
   - type: adjacency
     elements:
       - pixel
       - pixel
     description: pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - type: pattern
     description: four red pixels create a 2x2 block
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Red Squares:** Scan the input grid to find all 2x2 squares where all four pixels are red (color code 2).
2.  **Locate Target Pixel:** Within each identified 2x2 red square, pinpoint the pixel in the bottom-right corner.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the targeted pixel from red (2) to blue (1).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid retain their original colors.
5.  **Final Grid = original with the changes.**

Essentially the algorithm detects all instances of four adjacent red cells in a square, then it transforms the red pixel at the lower-right to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
