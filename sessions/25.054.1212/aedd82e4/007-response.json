The input grid contains pixels of two colors: red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The output grid also contains white and red pixels, and introduces blue pixels (represented by the number 1). The positions of the red pixels are unchanged, and it appears we are focused on changing some of the white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
