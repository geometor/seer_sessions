            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to find 2x2 squares of red pixels and change the bottom-right pixel of those squares to blue. This works for some cases but fails in others. The primary issue is that the code *only* considers the bottom-right pixel of perfect 2x2 red squares.  The examples show that the transformation rule needs to be more nuanced and should not be restricted to the bottom-right of 2x2 squares, but to pixels below or to the right of a 2x2 square.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Instead of just looking for 2x2 red squares, perhaps identify different configurations.\n2.  **Re-evaluate the Transformation Rule:** The rule needs to be more precise about *which* red pixel, relative to the identified 2x2 squares, changes to blue. It's not always the bottom-right of the 2x2.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\nHere's a summary, per example, that will be documented in the YAML.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has one 2x2 red square.\n    *   The expected transform is the pixel to the *left* of the bottom left of the 2x2.\n    *   Code transforms the bottom-right pixel of the 2x2 square. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has no complete 2x2 red square.\n    *   There are two locations with three red cells in a 2x2 square.\n    *    Expected transform changes the two red pixels, adjacent to a group of\n        three red pixels forming a corner of a 2x2 square, to blue, but they are\n        in a different relative location to the red pixels than example 1.\n    *   Code does nothing. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has one complete 2x2 red square.\n    *   Expected output turns bottom-right pixel to blue\n    *   Code does nothing. Incorrect\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *   Input has three red cells in a 2x2 area.\n    *    Expected transform is for the two single red cells, forming a \"corner\" of a\n         potential 2x2 square, that are also adjacent to the red cells, to turn blue.\n    *   Code does nothing. Incorrect.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    2x2_red_squares: 1\n    transform_location: \"left of the bottom left pixel of the 2x2\"\n    code_correct: False\n  - id: 2\n    2x2_red_squares: 0\n    partial_2x2_red_squares: 2\n    transform_location: \"adjacent to the corner of the 3-red-pixel configuration\"\n    transform_relative: \"to the right, and below\"\n    code_correct: False\n  - id: 3\n    2x2_red_squares: 1\n    transform_location: \"bottom-right pixel of the 2x2\"\n    code_correct: False\n  - id: 4\n    2x2_red_squares: 0\n    partial_2x2_red_squares: 1\n    transform_location: \"adjacent to the corner of the 3-red-pixel configuration\"\n    transform_relative: \"to the right, and below\"\n    code_correct: False\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify 2x2 Red Squares:** Find all instances where four red pixels form a 2x2 square.\n2.  **Identify Partial 2x2 Red Squares:** Find instances where three red pixels exist in a 2x2 area (forming a corner).\n3.  **Transform Based on Configuration**\n    *   If it finds a complete 2x2 square, then it will search for an individual red pixel that shares an edge with it.\n    *   If a 2x2 square is identified, and it is the configuration in example 3, then the bottom right pixel will change to blue.\n    *   If a corner of 3 red pixels of a 2x2 area is found, transform any red pixels adjacent to the open edge to blue.\n    *    If only a corner is present, then the transformation depends on the \"open\" direction of the corner.\n\nThis revised natural language program takes into account that we need to look for variations of red squares and that the transformed pixel will be red and located adjacent to red squares.\n"
