## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 2 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 2
0 2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4757A110>

**output:**
```
2 2 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC48DA7D90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 4x4 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The output grid also contains white and red pixels, and introduces blue pixels (represented by the number 1). The positions of the red pixels are unchanged, and it appears we are focused on changing some of the white pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
        positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,3), (3,1)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [(0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)]
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
        positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,3), (3,1)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions:  [(0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,3)]
      - color: blue (1)
        positions: [(3,2), (2,3)]

actions:
  - type: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: white pixels
    condition: specific white pixels adjacent to red pixels.
    result: blue pixels

relationships:
   - adjacency:  The positions of new blue pixels are diagonally adjacent to red pixels in the original input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all red pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all white pixels.
3. **Identify** all white pixels that are *diagonally adjacent* to red pixels, traveling down and to the left *from* the red pixels.
4.  **Change** the color of the selected white pixels from white (0) to blue (1).
5.  **Preserve** the color and position of all other pixels (red and the remaining white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
