            "text": "Here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided information and a strategy for refining the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the overall pattern of expanding the input grid. However, it incorrectly replicates the input grid as a 2x2 block, leading to errors in pixel placement. The core issue is that the replication logic isn't accurately mirroring the input grid's structure in the output. Instead of a simple block replication, the transformation seems to involve a more nuanced mirroring or reflection of the input grid along both axes.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Transformation:** Carefully analyze how each pixel in the input maps to the output, paying close attention to the mirroring effect.\n2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the mirroring transformation, rather than simple block replication.\n3.  **Adjust the Code:** Modify the code to implement the correct mirroring logic, ensuring each input pixel is placed in the correct mirrored positions in the output grid.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\nA programmatic analysis failed, but it can be reasoned as follows:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The input grid is 3x4. The output is 6x8. The error pattern suggests a flawed mirroring effect.\n*   **Example 2:** The input grid is 3x4. The output is 6x8. Similar to Example 1, the error indicates incorrect mirroring.\n*   **Example 3:** The input grid is 3x4. The output is 6x8. The error continues to point to a mirroring issue.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 008-py_04\nobjects:\n  - description: Input grid\n    properties:\n      shape: Variable (3x4 in examples)\n      content: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n\n  - description: Output grid\n    properties:\n      shape: Double the dimensions of the input grid (6x8 in examples)\n      content: 2D array of color values, a mirrored version of the input\n\nactions:\n  - type: Mirroring\n    description: The input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to produce the output grid.\n    details: Each pixel at (i, j) in the input corresponds to four pixels in the output: at (i,j) (2*i, 2*j), across x axis(i, inputcolumns -j), across y axis(inputrows, j), corner(inputrows - i, inputcols -j).\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Double Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.\n2.  **Mirror Input:** The contents of the output grid are generated by mirroring the input grid:\n\n    *   Each cell in the input grid at position (row, col) is mapped to four cells:\n        1. cell in top-left quadrant\n        2. cell in the top-right quadrant - reflected from left\n        3. cell in the bottom-left quadrant- reflected from top\n        4.  cell in the bottom-right quadrant - reflected from both\n3.  **Replication is incorrect:** The original assumption of simple block\n    replication is wrong. The essence of this task is to reflect/mirror the\n    input grid.\n\n"
