## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 3 3
0 3 0 3
3 3 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7BFC475021D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0
0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0
3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3
3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3
0 3 0 3 3 0 3 0
0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7BFC47502860>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to be replicated and expanded in a specific pattern to form the output grid. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are maintained in the output grid. The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 4
      colors: [0, 3]
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 6
      columns: 8
      colors: [0, 3]

actions:
  - type: replication
    subject: input_grid
    properties:
      horizontal_factor: 2
      vertical_factor: 2
      pattern: tiled

relationships:
  - subject: input_grid
    relation: is_transformed_into
    object: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is expanded to create the output grid. The input grid is doubled in both dimensions (height and width). This is achieved by replicating the input grid twice horizontally and twice vertically, creating a 2x2 tiled pattern of the original input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
