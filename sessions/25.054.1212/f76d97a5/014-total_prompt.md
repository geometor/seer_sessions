## Example 3

**input:**
```
9 5 9 9 9
9 9 5 5 9
9 5 9 9 9
9 9 5 9 9
9 9 9 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC48908D00>

**output:**
```
0 9 0 0 0
0 0 9 9 0
0 9 0 0 0
0 0 9 0 0
0 0 0 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains two colors (represented by 9 and 5) while the output grid mostly uses another, third color (represented by 0), and uses the number '9' from the original input grid in certain places. The positions of '9' in the output seem to correlate with the positions of '9' and '5' from the input. It appears that 5's are replaced by 0's, and 9's are either kept as 9's, or replaced with 0's.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: [9, 5]
      - dimensions: 5x5
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: [0, 9]
      - dimensions: 5x5

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    input: 5
    output: 0
  - name: check_neighbors
    input: 9
    logic: "If the '9' has a neighbor '5' in the down or right, change it to '0'."
      
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The output grid maintains the same dimensions as the input grid."
  - type: transformation
    description: "Input values are transformed based on certain conditions"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with 0s.
2.  **Color Replacement**: Iterate through the input grid.
3. **Copy 9s**: If a cell in the input grid contains a '9', check its *down* and *right* neighbors.
4. **Conditional Replacement**: If neither the cell to its *down* nor the cell to its *right* is '5', then copy the value '9' to the corresponding position of the output grid. Otherwise the element '9' is replaced by '0'.
5.  **Replace 5s**: If a cell in the input grid is a '5', the corresponding position of the output grid will be a '0'.

In summary, the output grid is derived based on a specific context of the position and adjacency properties of the input grid: 9's neighboring 5's on the right or down are replaced with 0. Otherwise they stay 9, and all 5s are replaced with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
