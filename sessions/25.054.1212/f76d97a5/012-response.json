If a gray pixel is at a corner of the grid, change it to white (0).\n2.  **Preserve original**: Before step 3, for each gray pixel store it's original adjacent colors\n3.  **Adjacent Replacement:** For each white pixel (0) that *was* a gray pixel, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right - not diagonally).  If a neighbor was of one of the original adjacencies, change that pixel to white (0) as well.\n4.
