## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 6 6 6
6 5 5 6 6
6 6 5 5 6
6 6 6 5 5
5 6 6 6 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47587FA0>

**output:**
```
6 6 0 0 0
0 6 6 0 0
0 0 6 6 0
0 0 0 6 6
6 0 0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47584D60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6). The output grid contains magenta (6) and white (0). The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant (5x5). The core change seems to be a replacement of certain colors based on their spatial arrangement or neighbors. Specifically, all gray pixels are changed to white, and some magenta pixels are also changed to white. It appears that magenta pixels that have many gray neighbors, or are surrounded by an L-shape of magenta, are changed.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 5
      - height: 5
      - colors: [gray, magenta, white]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

transformation_rules:
- replace all pixels color gray to white
- replace some pixels color magenta to white

objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      colors: [5, 6]
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      colors: [6, 0]

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: The relative positions of pixels influence the color changes.
    - type: color_change
      description: Gray (5) always changes to white (0). Magenta (6) changes to white (0) based on its neighbors
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an input grid of size 5x5.
2.  **Gray Replacement:** Iterate through every pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is gray (5), change it to white (0).
3.  **Magenta Replacement (Conditional):** Iterate through the grid again.
    *   Examine the color magenta (6)
    *   For each pixel that has the color magenta (6) replace with white (0) if the pixel meets *any* of the following conditions:
        *   The pixel is located in either the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner.
        *   If the pixel directly to its left *and* the pixel directly above it have a magenta (6) color.
        *    If the pixel directly to its right *and* the pixel directly above it have a magenta (6) color.
        *   If the pixel directly to its left *and* the pixel directly below it have a magenta (6) color.
        *    If the pixel directly to its right *and* the pixel directly below it have a magenta (6) color.

4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

In essence, the rule replaces gray pixels unconditionally and replaces magenta pixels in corners, or adjacent to an "L" shape of other magenta pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
