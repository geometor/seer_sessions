The input grid contains the digits 4 and 5 (yellow and gray), while the output grid contains 0 and 4 (white and yellow). The transformation seems to involve replacing all 5s with 4s, and all 4s with 0s. It appears that a simple color substitution/replacement rule is in play.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
