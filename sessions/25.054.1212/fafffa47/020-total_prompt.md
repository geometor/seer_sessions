## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 9
9 9 9
0 9 0
1 0 0
0 1 1
0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC47502440>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x3 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The colors present in the input are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1), while the output contains only white (0) and red (2).  The output grid appears to be a simplified or summarized version of the input grid, focusing on specific colors and their positions. The dimensions of the output are related to those of the input; the height is halved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    id: input_grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [2,0], [3,1], [3,2], [4,0], [5,0], [5,1]]
      - color: maroon (9)
        positions: [[0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,1]]
      - color: blue (1)
        positions: [[3, 0], [4,1], [4,2], [5,2]]

  - type: grid
    id: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]
      - color: red (2)
        positions: [[0,1], [2,0]]

relationships:
  - type: dimension_reduction
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    factor: height reduced by half

actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    original: maroon (9)
    replacement: red (2)

  - type: color_filtering
    removed_colors: [blue (1)]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** The program identifies maroon (9) pixels in the input grid.

2. **Halve the Height:** The output grid's height is half of the input grid's height. The width is the same.

3. **Map and Transform.**:
   Iterate through the rows the input grid, two at a time. Check if any 9s appear in those rows.

    - If there's a `9` in the first row of the pair, place a `2` in the corresponding column of the current output row.
    - if there is a 9 in the second row of the pair of input rows, place a `2` below it.

4. **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in output grid remain white(0). All 1s are ignored.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
