Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program transforms a 6x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid.
It identifies maroon (9) pixels in the input, halves the height, 
and maps these to red (2) pixels in the output. If a 9 is found
in the first of a pair of input rows, a 2 is placed in the
corresponding column of the output. 9s in the second of the pair
are ignored.  All other cells are white (0).

    # initialize output_grid
    input_height = len(input_grid)
    input_width = len(input_grid[0])
    output_height = input_height // 2
    output_width = input_width
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels
    for row_index in range(0, input_height, 2):
        for col_index in range(input_width):

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
