The input grid contains three colors: white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid contains white (0) and red (2). It appears that the non-white colors in the input grid are somehow mapped or converted to red in the output grid. The spatial relationship or arrangement of the colors seems significant. The input grid seems to be divided into 3x3 blocks of 2x1, in other words 3 sub grids where each sub grid height = 2 and width = 1.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If no non-white colors, then skip this sub grid.\n4. **Map** the sub grid to a single cell in the output (3x3) grid. If the 2x1 block contains *any* maroon (9) or blue(1) pixels, the corresponding output cell becomes red (2). Otherwise if they are all white then they stay as white (0).\n\nEssentially, each 2x1 block in the input is reduced to a single cell in the output. If that 2x1 block contains any non-white color, the output cell is red (2); otherwise, it's white (0).\n"
