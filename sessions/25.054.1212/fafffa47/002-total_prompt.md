## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
0 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The input grid is 6x3, while the output grid is 3x3. The output grid's dimensions are half the height of the input grid and equal the width of the input and output grids.
*   The input grid seems to be divided into two 3x3 subgrids, based on the image.
*   The colors in the input grid are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1).
*   The colors in the output grid are red (2) and white (0).
*	It appears the top 3x3 part of the input is the most important

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements: [0, 9, 1]
    properties:
      - divided_into: [top_subgrid, bottom_subgrid]

  - id: top_subgrid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 9]

  - id: bottom_subgrid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1]

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [2, 0]

actions:
  - type: map_color
    input: top_subgrid
    output: output_grid
    mapping:
        9: 2
        0: 0
        1: none

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: input_grid contains top_subgrid and bottom_subgrid
    notes: "input grid vertically stacked"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Subgrids:** Divide the input grid into two 3x3 subgrids: a "top" subgrid (rows 1-3) and a "bottom" subgrid (rows 4-6).
2.  **Focus on Top Subgrid:** Disregard the "bottom" subgrid. The transformation operates solely on the "top" subgrid.
3. **Color Mapping:** Apply these color transformations:
    *   If a cell in the "top" subgrid is maroon (9), change it to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   If a cell in the "top" subgrid" is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
    * 	If a cell has any other value it is not included in the output
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying the color mapping to the "top" subgrid.

Essentially, the program extracts the top 3x3 subgrid and performs a simple color substitution, mapping 9 to 2 and keeping 0 as is.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
