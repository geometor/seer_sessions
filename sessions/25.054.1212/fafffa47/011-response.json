            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, the issues with the previous code, and a plan for improvement:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, focusing on the top half of the input grid and mapping maroon (9) to red (2) and white (0) to white (0). However, it incorrectly assumed a direct positional mapping within the top half. The testing results clearly show that the relative positions of the maroon pixels within the top half are *not* preserved in the output. Instead, the output consistently shows a pattern related to the *entire* top half of the input, not just the first three rows. The code needs to understand the logic of how all maroon pixels in the top half condense into a specific pattern of red pixels in the output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The core assumption about direct positional mapping is wrong. We need to shift our focus from individual positions to the overall pattern of maroon pixels in the top half.\n2.  **Identify the Output Pattern:** Carefully analyze the expected outputs. There's a clear relationship between the *arrangement* of maroon pixels in the top half of the input and the arrangement of red pixels in the output.\n3.  **Holistic Top-Half Processing:** Instead of processing only the first three rows of the top half, process the *entire* top half to count and locate all maroon pixels.\n4.  **Conditional Mapping:** The red (2) pixels in the output are placed based on specific rules, which are tied to the original locations. This will likely involve conditional checks based on row and column indices of the maroon pixels in the top half of the input grid.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI'll create a summary of the results in a more organized format, focusing on what's relevant for understanding the pattern:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Maroon Pixels (Top Half) | Output Shape | Red Pixels (Output) |  Notes on Mismatch  |\n| :-----: | :---------: | :----------------------: | :----------: | :-----------------: | :----------------: |\n|    1    |    6 x 3    |            5             |    3 x 3     |          2          | All pixels incorrect |\n|    2    |    6 x 3    |            5             |    3 x 3     |          2          | Most incorrect.     |\n|    3    |    6 x 3    |            4             |    3 x 3     |          4        | All incorrect      |\n|    4    |    6 x 3    |            5             |    3 x 3     |          2          |  Most incorrect    |\n|    5    |    6 x 3    |            5             |    3 x 3     |           1         | Most incorrect      |\n\n**Observations about the pattern**\n*   The output is always 3x3.\n*   The color mapping is consistent: maroon (9) becomes red (2), and white (0) remains white (0). Other colors in the input are ignored.\n*   The arrangement and number of the red pixels are what we have to figure out.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: \"010\"\ninput_objects:\n  - color: 9  # Maroon\n    shape: variable\n    positions: variable  # Positions within the top half of the grid\n  - color: 0  # White\n    shape: variable\n    positions: variable\n  - color: 1 # Blue\n    shape: variable\n    positions: variable\n\noutput_objects:\n  - color: 2  # Red\n    shape: variable\n    positions: specific pattern  # Determined by a rule based on maroon positions\n  - color: 0  # White\n    shape: variable\n    positions: variable\n\nactions:\n  - map_color:\n      from: 9  # Maroon\n      to: 2  # Red\n  - map_color:\n      from: 0\n      to: 0\n  - determine_output_position:\n      input_object: maroon_pixels\n      rule: \"A specific, yet-to-be-determined rule based on the distribution of maroon pixels in the *entire* top half of the input grid.\"\n  - ignore:\n      color: 1\n\ngrid_size:\n    input: variable, always even number of rows.\n    output: 3x3\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Input Half:** Divide the input grid into two equal halves vertically. Focus on the top half.\n2.  **Locate Key Pixels:** Within the top half, identify all pixels with the color maroon (9) and white(0). Ignore all other colors.\n3.  **Map Colors:**\n    *   Maroon (9) pixels in the top half will be mapped to red (2) pixels in the output.\n    *   White(0) pixels in the top half will be mapped to white(0) pixels in the\n        output.\n4.  **Determine Output Positions:** The output grid is always 3x3. The positions of the red pixels are determined by this rule.\n    *   If there is a maroon pixel in the top half's *first* row, then output a\n        red pixel in the top row.\n    *   If there is a maroon pixel in the top half's *last* row, then output a red\n        pixel in the bottom row.\n    *   If there is a maroon pixel in the top half's first column, output a red in\n        the first column.\n    *   If there is a maroon pixel in the last column, output a red pixel in the last\n        column.\n5.  **Fill Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Apply the color mapping and output position rules determined in steps 3 and 4. Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).\n\n"
