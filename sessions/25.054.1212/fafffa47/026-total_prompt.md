## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 9 0
0 9 9
0 9 9
0 0 0
1 1 1
1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC47501750>

**output:**
```
2 0 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A62020>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (6x3) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains three distinct colors (represented by digits): white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid seems to retain a compressed representation related to a specific color from the upper portion of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements: [0, 9, 1]  # white, maroon, blue
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0,2] #white, red

observations:
  - The input grid is twice the height of the output grid.
  - input grid contains objects of color 9 in the top half
  - input grid contains objects of color 1 and color 0 in the bottom half
  - output grid is color 0 except where color 9 objects are present. There they are color 2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on the top half:** Consider only the top half (first three rows) of the input grid.
2.  **Sub grid creation**: Create a 3x3 sub-grid to compare it.
3.  **Translate colors.** For each cell that has a color 9 represent with color 2 in the output grid. Otherwise, maintain color 0 in the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
