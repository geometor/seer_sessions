            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies 2x2 blocks of non-white colors but fails to accurately map these blocks to the output grid.  The core issue is the mapping logic, currently represented by placeholder modulo operations (`output_row = r % 4` and `output_col = c % 4`). This mapping doesn't reflect the actual relationship between the input and output grids, as evidenced by the mismatches in all examples. The code only considers first 4 rows, but the examples show that 2x2 blocks are relevant and are mapped based on which quadrant of the original input they are in.\n\nThe strategy to fix this involves:\n1. **Correcting the Mapping:** Replacing the placeholder mapping logic with a correct transformation that relates the position of the 2x2 block in the input to the corresponding pixel in the output.\n2. **Quadrant Mapping** Examining all example input-output pairs and see how the location of the detected 2x2 square in the input is positioned in the 4x4 output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, going beyond simple pixel comparisons.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two 2x2 blocks: orange (7) at (0,1) and (1,1), and another orange at (2,1), (3,1) .\n    *   Expected Output: Green (3) at (0,2) and (1,0).\n    *   Observed behavior: The current mapping is incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has four 2x2 blocks: orange (7).\n    *   Expected output suggests mapping based on quadrants\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n        *   Input has three 2x2 orange.\n        *   Again, need to derive the correct mapping.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input has three 2x2 orange blocks.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 016\n\nobservations:\n  - object: 2x2_block\n    properties:\n      color: non-white\n      size: 2x2\n      location: top_left_pixel_coordinates\n    actions:\n      detected: find_2x2_blocks function identifies these\n      mapped: location within original image determines placement of green pixel in output\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      size: 4x4\n      color_palette: limited (0 and 3)\n    actions:\n      initialized: to all zeros (white)\n      populated: green pixel placed based on presence of 2x2 block in input\n    notes: |\n        The location of the green pixel in the output grid represents the top-left corner of a detected 2x2 colored region.\n\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n        size: variable, >4x4\n    actions:\n        scanned: for 2x2 blocks\n\ntransformation_rule: |\n    The input grid is scanned for 2x2 blocks of identical, non-white pixels.  For each such block found, a green (3) pixel is placed in the 4x4 output grid. The location of that pixel is determined by the top-left coordinate of the 2x2 block in the input, using a mapping to define which 2x2 section in the input will be mapped to which cell in the output.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a 4x4 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.\n\n2.  **Block Detection:** Scan the entire input grid to identify all 2x2 blocks where all four pixels have the same non-white color.\n\n3. **Quadrant Mapping:** The input grid is logically divided into 2x2 quadrants of any dimension. Map the coordinates of any 2x2 detected blocks to the output based on the following rule.\n    - If a 2x2 block of the same non-white color are located with their top-left pixel at Input(r,c), the place a Green (3) pixel at output(r//2, c//2), rounding down.\n\n4. **Output** return the 4x4 grid.\n"
