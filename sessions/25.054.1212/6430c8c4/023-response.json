            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined strategy, YAML documentation, and an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial strategy correctly identified the divider and the region of interest (above the divider). However, the mirroring logic and color mapping are incorrect. The mirrored position is correct (swapping i and j), but the condition to apply the mirroring is flawed.  It's not *all* non-zero pixels; it's specifically the orange (7) pixels in the examples. Also, the output color is always green (3) for the mirrored pixels, rather than carrying over the original non-white color.\n\nThe strategy needs to be adjusted as follows:\n\n1.  **Refine Mirroring Condition:** Only mirror orange (7) pixels.\n2.  **Correct Output Color:** The output color for mirrored pixels should always be green (3).\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on identifying the issues:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has a 4x4 region of orange(7) and white(0) pixels above the divider.\n    *   The mirroring logic maps some pixels incorrectly:\n        - (0,2) which has value 7, maps to (2,0).\n        - (0,3) which has value 0 does not map\n        - (1,1) incorrectly maps.\n        - (1,2) correctly maps.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has a 4x4 region of orange and white pixels above the divider.\n        - (0, 2) which contains a 7 correctly maps\n        - (0, 3) which contains a 7 correctly maps\n        - (1,2) which contains a 7 correctly maps\n        - (1,3) which contains a 7 incorrectly maps\n\n*   **Example 3 & 4**\n    *   Similar pattern of incorrect, but close, mapping.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 022\nsummary: |\n  The input grid is divided into two regions by a horizontal line of yellow pixels. The area above the yellow line is transformed by mirroring the orange pixels across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), changing their color to green in the output grid.\nobjects:\n  - id: divider\n    type: horizontal_line\n    color: yellow\n    properties:\n      - divides the grid into upper and lower regions\n  - id: upper_region\n    type: grid_region\n    properties:\n      - located above the divider\n      - contains orange and white pixels.\n      - determines the output size.\n  - id: orange_pixels\n    type: pixel\n    color: orange\n    properties:\n      - located in upper_region\n      - mirrored across the main diagonal\n  - id: output_pixels\n    type: pixel\n    color: green\n    properties:\n       - all mirrored orange pixels are mapped to this color.\nactions:\n  - name: find_divider\n    description: Locate the horizontal line of yellow pixels.\n  - name: separate_regions\n    description: Divide the input grid into upper and lower regions based on the divider.\n  - name: mirror_orange\n    description: Mirror orange pixels in the upper region across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and set color to green.\n  - name: initialize_output\n    description: set output size by the upper region and fill the entire array with 0.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Divider:** Locate the horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Separate Regions:** Define the \"upper region\" as the area above the divider and the \"lower region\" as the area at and below the divider.\n3.  **Determine Output Size:** The dimensions of the output grid are the same as the dimensions of the *upper region*.\n4.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with white (0) pixels, with the size determined in the previous step.\n5.  **Mirror Orange Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel in the *upper region*.\n    *   If a pixel is orange (7):\n        *   Swap its row and column indices (i, j) to get the mirrored position (j, i).\n        *   If the mirrored position is within the bounds of the *upper region*, set the pixel at the mirrored position in the *output grid* to green (3).\n6.  **Ignore Other Pixels:**  Pixels in the upper region that are not orange (7) are not explicitly processed; they remain white (0) in the output because of initialization. The lower region does not affect the output.\n7.  **Output:** Return the output grid.\n"
