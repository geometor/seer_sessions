observations:
  - object: 2x2_block
    properties:
      color: non-white
      size: 2x2
      location: top_left_pixel_coordinates
    actions:
      detected: find_2x2_blocks function identifies these
      mapped: location within original image determines placement of green pixel in output

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      size: 4x4
      color_palette: limited (0 and 3)
    actions:
      initialized: to all zeros (white)
      populated: green pixel placed based on presence of 2x2 block in input
    notes: |
        The location of the green pixel in the output grid represents the top-left corner of a detected 2x2 colored region.

  - object: input_grid
    properties:
        size: variable, >4x4
    actions:
        scanned: for 2x2 blocks

transformation_rule: |
    The input grid is scanned for 2x2 blocks of identical, non-white pixels.  For each such block found, a green (3) pixel is placed in the 4x4 output grid. The location of that pixel is determined by the top-left coordinate of the 2x2 block in the input, using a mapping to define which 2x2 section in the input will be mapped to which cell in the output.
