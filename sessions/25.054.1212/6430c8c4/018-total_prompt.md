Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identifies 2x2 blocks of non-white colors but fails to accurately map these blocks to the output grid.  The core issue is the mapping logic, currently represented by placeholder modulo operations (`output_row = r % 4` and `output_col = c % 4`). This mapping doesn't reflect the actual relationship between the input and output grids, as evidenced by the mismatches in all examples. The code only considers first 4 rows, but the examples show that 2x2 blocks are relevant and are mapped based on which quadrant of the original input they are in.

The strategy to fix this involves:
1. **Correcting the Mapping:** Replacing the placeholder mapping logic with a correct transformation that relates the position of the 2x2 block in the input to the corresponding pixel in the output.
2. **Quadrant Mapping** Examining all example input-output pairs and see how the location of the detected 2x2 square in the input is positioned in the 4x4 output.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example, going beyond simple pixel comparisons.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two 2x2 blocks: orange (7) at (0,1) and (1,1), and another orange at (2,1), (3,1) .
    *   Expected Output: Green (3) at (0,2) and (1,0).
    *   Observed behavior: The current mapping is incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has four 2x2 blocks: orange (7).
    *   Expected output suggests mapping based on quadrants

*   **Example 3:**
        *   Input has three 2x2 orange.
        *   Again, need to derive the correct mapping.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input has three 2x2 orange blocks.

**YAML Fact Sheet**

```yaml
task_id: 016

observations:
  - object: 2x2_block
    properties:
      color: non-white
      size: 2x2
      location: top_left_pixel_coordinates
    actions:
      detected: find_2x2_blocks function identifies these
      mapped: location within original image determines placement of green pixel in output

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      size: 4x4
      color_palette: limited (0 and 3)
    actions:
      initialized: to all zeros (white)
      populated: green pixel placed based on presence of 2x2 block in input
    notes: |
        The location of the green pixel in the output grid represents the top-left corner of a detected 2x2 colored region.

  - object: input_grid
    properties:
        size: variable, >4x4
    actions:
        scanned: for 2x2 blocks

transformation_rule: |
    The input grid is scanned for 2x2 blocks of identical, non-white pixels.  For each such block found, a green (3) pixel is placed in the 4x4 output grid. The location of that pixel is determined by the top-left coordinate of the 2x2 block in the input, using a mapping to define which 2x2 section in the input will be mapped to which cell in the output.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 4x4 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.

2.  **Block Detection:** Scan the entire input grid to identify all 2x2 blocks where all four pixels have the same non-white color.

3. **Quadrant Mapping:** The input grid is logically divided into 2x2 quadrants of any dimension. Map the coordinates of any 2x2 detected blocks to the output based on the following rule.
    - If a 2x2 block of the same non-white color are located with their top-left pixel at Input(r,c), the place a Green (3) pixel at output(r//2, c//2), rounding down.

4. **Output** return the 4x4 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
