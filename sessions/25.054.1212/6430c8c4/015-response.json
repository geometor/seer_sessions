            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which it handled imperfectly. It correctly identified the 4x4 output size and the use of green (3) to represent 2x2 blocks. However, the mapping logic is flawed, leading to incorrect placement of the green pixels in the output grid. The subsequent examples reveal more complex mapping rules than initially anticipated. The core issue is how the position of the 2x2 blocks in the *input* relates to the position of the green pixels in the *output*. Simply using the modulo operator (`% 4`) is insufficient. We need a better strategy for determining the output row and column based on *all* the training examples. It seems the top 4x4 area of the input is most relevant.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Observations:** Carefully re-examine *all* training examples. Pay close attention to the coordinates of the 2x2 blocks in the input and the corresponding green pixel locations in the output.\n2.  **Identify Mapping Logic:** Determine a consistent rule or algorithm that explains how input block coordinates map to output pixel coordinates. It probably does *not* depend on the lower section of the image.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Revise the natural language description to accurately reflect the refined understanding of the transformation.\n4.  **Modify Code:**  Update the `transform` function in the Python code to implement the corrected mapping logic.\n5. **Iterate:** Repeat testing and use the validation feedback to improve the results.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including some hand-calculated properties:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   2x2 Blocks (top-left corner coordinates): (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (7,0)\n    *   Expected Output: Green pixels at (0,2), (1,0)\n    *   Observed Output: Green Pixels at (1, 1), (2, 1)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   2x2 Blocks: (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2)\n    *   Expected Output: Green pixels at (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3)\n    *   Observed Output: Green pixels at (0, 2)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   2x2 Blocks: (1,1), (1,2), (3,1), (3,2), (6, 1)\n    *   Expected Output: Green pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n    *   Observed Output: none\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   2x2 Blocks: (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (7,1)\n    *   Expected Output: Green pixels at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) (2, 1)\n    *   Observed Output: Green pixels at (1, 2)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 014\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_size: 9x4\n    output_size: 4x4\n    input_objects:\n      - type: 2x2_block\n        color: 7\n        top_left_positions: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)]\n      - type: 2x2_block\n        color: 2\n        top_left_positions: [(7,0)]\n    output_objects:\n      - type: pixel\n        color: 3\n        positions: [(0,2), (1,0)]\n    transformation: \"Input 2x2 blocks of color 7 map to green pixel at (input_row % 4, input_col%4).

It seems to depend on which quadrant of the 4x4 grid it is located in.\n4. **Colors:** The output uses only colors from input (black 0 and green 3)\n\nBased on all examples, we are still trying to find the exact mapping of the green pixels into the 4x4 output grid.\n"
