Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Divider:** Find the horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This line is the divider.
2.  **Separate Regions:** Divide the input grid into two regions: "upper region" (above the divider) and "lower region" (at and below the divider).
3.  **Ignore Lower Region:** Disregard the lower region.
4. **Determine output size:** The output size is determined by the upper region.
5.  **Initialize output:** Create a grid filled with 0 in the dimensions determined by the upper region.
6.  **Mirror and Map:** For the upper region:
      - The non-white pixels appear to be getting mapped across a diagonal line, specifically from the top left to the bottom-right. If you draw this line, they are being mapped to the other side.
      - All of the original white pixels are turned to 0.

7.  **Output:** Return the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
