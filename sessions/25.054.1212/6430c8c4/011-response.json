            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example and clearly doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that the logic for determining the output row and column of the green pixel is too simplistic and based on assumptions made about the first example that did not hold true. It seems to be placing the green pixels at the top-left and top-right portions of the output grid based on where orange pixels are found, and is not fully accounting for the orange pixels throughout the input.\n\nThe strategy should involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:**  The current code is built on assumptions from the first example - we need to step back from any prior assumptions and review the entire set.\n2.  **Precise Mapping:**  We need a much clearer, more robust rule for how the *location* of orange pixels in the input 2x2 subgrids translates to the location of green pixels in the output grid. We need to carefully analyze *all* examples, not just the first one.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated natural language program and corresponding code *after each change*, not just at the end.\n4. **Focus on Relative Positioning:** Instead of absolute positioning, consider thinking of output placement in terms of the orange pixels relative location within the 2x2 subgrid.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\nHere is a summary of relevant metrics, focusing on differences between expectations and results to figure out how to modify the rule.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Notes: Two green pixels are incorrectly placed at the top left and top right when they should be at the top right and the row beneath at the top left.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Pixels Off: 5\n    *   Notes: Similar to example 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Notes: Again, green pixels in the wrong location\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Pixels Off: 5\n    * Notes: The first row of green pixels are generated, but that does not account for the second and third rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 010\n    example_set: train\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties:\n          role: input\n          dimensions: variable\n          elements: pixels (0-9)\n      - type: grid\n        properties:\n          role: output\n          dimensions: 4x4\n          elements: pixels (0-9)\n      - type: subgrid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: 2x2\n          parent: input_grid\n          contains: pixels\n      - type: pixel\n        properties:\n          color: orange (7)\n          role: trigger\n      - type: pixel\n        properties:\n          color: green (3)\n          role: result\n    actions:\n      - description: Scan input grid by 2x2 subgrids.\n      - description: Check for presence of orange pixel within subgrid.\n      - description: If orange pixel present, place a green pixel in the output grid.\n      - description: Output grid location is determined by the location of the 2x2 subgrid, mapping to the quadrant in the output grid.\n    rules:\n      - condition: Orange pixel exists in 2x2 subgrid.\n        action: Place a green pixel in output grid.\n        location_rule: |\n          The row and column of the 2x2 subgrid within the input grid (when dividing the input into 2x2 sections) determines a corresponding position in the output grid. The x coordinate of the orange pixel determines the x coordinate of the output green pixel and the y coordinate of the orange determines the y coordinate of the output green pixel.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Divide and Conquer:** Divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 subgrids.\n2.  **Orange Check:** For each 2x2 subgrid, check if it contains at least one orange (7) pixel.\n3. **Green Placement - initial version** If a 2x2 subgrid contains an orange pixel, a green (3) pixel will be placed in the output grid.\n4.  **Output Grid Mapping**: Divide the 4x4 output grid conceptually into four 2x2 quadrants.\n    *   Top-left quadrant corresponds to 2x2 subgrids originating from rows 0, 1, and columns 0, 1 of the input grid.\n    *   Top-right quadrant corresponds to 2x2 subgrids originating from rows 0, 1 and columns >= 2 of the input grid, scaling based on input grid width.\n    * Bottom-left and bottom-right are similarly mapped.\n\n5. **Positional Rule**: The starting row and column indices (i, j) of the 2x2 subgrid in the input grid determine the quadrant in the output grid. The top-left corner pixel in a 2x2 block maps directly to one of the top-left corners of each of the output quadrants. If there is more than one orange in a 2x2 block, the top-left-most takes precedence for purposes of positioning.\n"
