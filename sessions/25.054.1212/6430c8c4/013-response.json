The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to contain only two colors: white (0) and green (3). The input grid appears to have distinct colored regions, possibly representing objects. The output grid's dimensions are smaller than the input grid, and the arrangement of green and white pixels seems to relate to some characteristic of the input. The colors in the input are diverse: white(0), orange(7), yellow(4) and red(2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
