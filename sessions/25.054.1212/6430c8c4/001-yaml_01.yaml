  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 4x4

      description: Simplified representation of the input.
  - observation: output_size_reduction
    description: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: color_change
    description: Some input colors map to different output colors (e.g., 7 -> 3).
  - observation: spatial_selection
    description: Only certain regions of the input are represented in the output, specifically the area in the top left area containing the colour 7, is mapped to 3.
  - observation: default_color
    description: Most of the output grid consists of the default color 0 (white).
