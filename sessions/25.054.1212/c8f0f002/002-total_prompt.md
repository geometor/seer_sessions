## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 8 8 7 7 8
1 1 7 7 1 8
7 1 1 7 7 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC4890B7F0>

**output:**
```
1 8 8 5 5 8
1 1 5 5 1 8
5 1 1 5 5 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC48909870>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a specific color change: orange (7) becomes gray (5). Other colors remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears to be preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - name: height
        value: 3
      - name: width
        value: 6
  - type: pixel
    description: individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - name: color
        values:
          - 1 (blue)
          - 8 (azure)
          - 7 (orange)
          - 5 (gray)

actions:
  - name: color_substitution
    description: Replace specific color value with another
    details:
      - original_color: 7 (orange)
      - new_color: 5 (gray)

relationships:
 - type: spatial_constancy
   description: Pixel positions remain the same after transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the pixel's color value is 7 (orange).
3.  **If** the color is 7, **replace** it with 5 (gray).
4.  **Otherwise**, keep the original color value.
5.  **Output** is the transformed pixel.
6. the position of all pixels is maintained in the transformation from input to output.

Essentially, the transformation rule is: "Replace all orange (7) pixels with gray (5) pixels, preserving the grid structure and all other colors."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
