      - description: Input grid
        properties:
          - Contains various colored pixels, including white (0) as background.
          - Other colors form shapes or lines.

      - description: Output grid
        properties:
          - Top two rows are always white (0).
          - Third row appears to be conditionally filled based on the input.
          - Lower rows are copied from the input.
          - the pixels on the third row match pixels directly below

          Lower rows (n-2) of the input are copied directly to the output.
          Colors other than white (0) in the top three rows of the input *influence*, but do not directly dictate, the output's third row. There's a conditional element we're missing, likely related to the *relative position* of non-white pixels and their neighbors below. There might be mirroring occurring.
