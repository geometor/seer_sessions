facts:
  - observation: |
      The bottom row of the input grid is used as a template for changes in the upper rows.
  - object: bottom_row_pixels
    properties:
      - type: list
      - description: Contains tuples of (position, color) for non-zero pixels in the bottom row.
  - object: replicated_pixels
    properties:
      - type: list
      - description: Derived from bottom_row_pixels, these are the pixels placed above.
  - action: replicate_with_offset
    description: |
      Certain colors from the bottom row are copied to positions in the rows above, specifically two rows up,
      and with a horizontal offset of -1 and +1 from their original column.
  - constraint: row_bounds
    description: |
      Replicated pixels must stay within the bounds of the grid (0 <= row < height, 0 <= col < width).
  - constraint: color_selection
    description: |
      Not all colors from the bottom row are replicated. There seems to be a rule, but we don't know exactly what it is yet.  Across all the examples, the colors 1, 2, 3, and 4 all follow the same rule.  The colors 6 and 8 do not.
  - rule: overwriting
    description: Existing non-zero colors in the grid can be overwritten.
