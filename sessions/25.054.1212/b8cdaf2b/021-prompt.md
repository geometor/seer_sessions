Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies a region in the upper part of the input grid and adds two mirrored, inverted, "L-shapes" using yellow pixels. The bottom section of red and yellow rows stays the same.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Modify pixels in the top region to create the mirrored L-shapes
    output_grid[3, 0] = 4  # Top-left of first L
    output_grid[4, 1] = 4  # Bottom-left of first L

    output_grid[3, 6] = 4  # Top-right of second L (mirrored)
    output_grid[4, 5] = 4  # Bottom-right of second L (mirrored)

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
