Identifies horizontal runs of contiguous green pixels. If a run has length 2 or more,
change all pixels in that run to azure. If a run has length 1, and is adjacent to
any pixel that has already been changed to azure, change to azure. Adjacency is checked
iteratively until no more changes can be made.
