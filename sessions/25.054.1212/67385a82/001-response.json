The transformation appears to be dependent on the initial values within the input grid.  Specifically, some colors in specific locations change, while others remain the same.  The key seems to be related to the green (3) and white (0) pixels in the input, and their locations in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
