Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1. Check the entire grid for the presence of green (3) in the bottom row.
2. Iterate through each pixel:
   - If the pixel is not green (3), it remains unchanged.
   - If the pixel is green (3):
     - If the pixel is in the top two rows (row index 0 or 1) AND there are NO green pixels in the bottom row, change it to azure (8).
     - Otherwise (pixel is in the bottom row, OR there ARE green pixels in the bottom row), leave it unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
