## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 8 0 3
8 8 0 0
3 0 0 3
0 0 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4757A650>

**output:**
```
8 8 0 3
8 8 0 0
8 0 0 8
0 0 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC475782B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 4x4 grid of colored pixels. The colors present are azure (8), white (0), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a change primarily affecting the green (3) and, in some cases, white(0) and azure (8) pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        - azure (8)
        - white (0)
        - green (3)

actions:
  - type: conditional_replacement
    trigger: presence of green(3)
    target: adjacent_pixels, possibly color dependent
    details: >
      Specific change conditional on adjacent colors.
      top right green becomes white
      bottom left green becomes azure

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: >-
      pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
      The transformation seems to be based on the immediate neighbors

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Green Pixels:** Identify all pixels with the value 3 (green).

2.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   If the green pixel is in the top right corner (row 0, col 3), change the cell immediately below (row 1, col 3) to white(0).
    *   If the green pixel is in the bottom left corner (row 2, col 0), change the color to azure (8)

3.  **No change:** all other pixels remain the same color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
