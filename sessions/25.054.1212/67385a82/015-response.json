            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were too specific, focusing on precise coordinates rather than generalizable rules. The code correctly identified and processed *some* green pixels (value 3) based on their initial position, but it failed when those positions changed. It changed green to azure correctly, but failed to make all the proper changes for green cells in the top row.\n\nThe core issue is that the transformation is not *just* about the top-right or bottom-left corner. It's about:\n\n1.  **Green pixels in the top row:** If a green pixel is in the top row, the pixel *directly below* it should sometimes be turned to white and sometimes to azure. It depends.\n2.  **Bottom-left green pixel:** Green Pixels in the bottom left should change to azure.\n3. No other pixels are affected.\n\nThe strategy is to generalize the conditions. Instead of checking for `r == 0 and c == 3`, we should check for `r == 0` (any green pixel in the first row). Similarly, change the bottom left check from `r == 2 and c == 0` to dynamically get the last row, and check only the column, `c == 0`. We need to refine further to determine when the value below the top-row green should be white and when it should be azure.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Green Pixel Locations: (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)\n    *   Expected Change: (1,1) -> 8, (2,0) -> 8\n    *   Observed Change: Only (2,0) changed, to 8\n    *   Issue: Incorrect condition for row 1 green pixel, and bottom left rule isn't general\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 6)\n    *   Green Pixel Locations: (0,1), (0,5), (2,4)\n    *   Expected Change: (0,1) -> 8\n    *   Observed Change: None\n    *   Issue: Incorrect condition for row 1 green pixels, and top right isn't general.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Green Pixel Locations: (0, 3), (2, 0), (2,3)\n    *   Expected Change: (0,3) -> 8, (2,0) -> 8\n    *   Observed Change: (2,0) -> 8\n    *   Issue: Incorrect condition for row 1 green pixel, and bottom left rule isn't general\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *  Input Shape: (5,6)\n    *  Green Pixel Location: (1,1), (1,4), (2,0)\n    *  Expected Changes: (1,1)->8, (2,0)->8\n    *  Observed Changes: (2,0)->8\n    *  Issue: Green pixels on the second row were identified, this should not be\n\n**Revised YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: Green pixels\n    color: 3\n    behavior:\n      top_row: |\n        If a green pixel is in the top row, examine the pixel directly below.\n        Change the pixel directly below the green pixel to azure (8) if it is not already azure.\n        Change the pixel directly below the green pixel to white (0) if it is already azure.\n\n      bottom_left: |\n        If a green pixel is in the bottom-left corner (first column, last row), change it to azure (8).\n\n  - description: All other pixels\n    behavior: No change in color.\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Green Pixels:** Identify all pixels with a value of 3 (green).\n\n2.  **Top Row Transformation:** For any green pixel in the top row (row 0):\n    * Check the color of the pixel directly below.\n        * If the pixel directly below is azure, change it to white (0).\n        * If the pixel directly below is NOT azure, change it to azure (8).\n        \n3.  **Bottom-Left Transformation:** If a green pixel is in the bottom-left corner (last row, column 0), change its color to azure (8).\n\n4. **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
