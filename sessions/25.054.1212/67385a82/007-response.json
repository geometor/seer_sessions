The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), green (3), and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some pixels of one color to another, specifically green (3) to azure (8) in some instances. The layout and positions of the green pixels seem to influence which ones get changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If a green pixel is part of the group, change its color to azure (8).\n\nIn short the program identifies groups of horizontally adjacent green pixels and changes them to azure.\n"
