## Example 4

**input:**
```
8 8 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x320 at 0x7BFC4757A650>

**output:**
```
8 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x320 at 0x7BFC47579FC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors present are primarily azure (8), green (3), and white (0). There are distinct objects formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation appears to involve a change in color of some of the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - azure (8)
        - green (3)
        - white (0)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
       color:
          - azure
          - green
       pixels: list of pixel objects

actions:
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      original_color: azure (8)
      new_color: azure (8)
      target: specific azure pixels

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal).
  - type: containment
    description: Contiguous blocks contain multiple pixels of the same color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) colored pixels and green (3) colored pixels.
2.  **Conditional Color change:** Examine the azure pixels adjacent to green.
3.  **Transformation**: Change the green-adjacent azure pixel on the right side of the first row of green pixel to azure color. Leave all other pixels unchanged.

In summary the transformation involves changing some of azure object to be consistence.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
