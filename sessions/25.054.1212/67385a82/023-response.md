Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were too simplistic. The code correctly identifies green and azure objects and attempts to find azure pixels to the right of green pixels. However, it fails to accurately capture the core rule, which involves changing green pixels to azure if an azure object is directly to the right. Additionally, the "first azure object" concept is flawed since the transformation isn't always on the 'first' azure object as previously defined. The primary issue is the misinterpretation of the *direction* of change and which object is triggering that change: it's the *presence* of an adjacent azure object to the right that causes adjacent *green* object to change color, not the other way around.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct the Direction of Influence:** The core logic needs to be flipped. Instead of changing azure pixels based on adjacent green pixels, we should change *green* pixels to *azure* if they have azure pixels to their *right*.
2.  **Remove "First Azure Object" Concept:** The transformation applies to any green pixel with a directly adjacent azure object on its right, not just to a specific "first" azure object.
3. **Object based approach** use the object lists from `find_objects_by_color` to identify a change in color.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting what went wrong:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `8 8 0\n0 3 0\n3 0 3`
    *   Expected: `8 8 0\n0 8 0\n3 0 3`
    *   Actual: `8 8 0\n0 3 0\n3 0 3`
    *   Error: The green pixel at (1, 1) should have changed to azure because there is an azure object to the right. The code failed to make this change and change the color to the right of green.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `0 3 0 0 0 3\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0`
    *   Expected: `0 8 0 0 0 3\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0`
    *   Actual: `0 3 0 0 0 3\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0`
    *   Error: The green pixel at (0, 1) should have changed to azure. The code failed to make this change and change the color to the right of green.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `8 8 0 3\n8 8 0 0\n3 0 0 3\n0 0 8 8`
    *   Expected: `8 8 0 3\n8 8 0 0\n8 0 0 8\n0 0 8 8`
    *   Actual: `8 8 0 3\n8 8 0 0\n3 0 0 3\n0 0 8 8`
    *   Error: The green pixel at (2, 0) should become azure, and the green pixel at (2,3) should become azure.

*    **Example 4:**
    *    Input: `8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 3`
    *    Expected: `8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 3 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 3`
    *    Actual:   `8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 3`
    *    Error: The green pixel at (1,1) should become azure. The green pixel at (2,0) should become azure.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green and Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of green (color 3) and azure (color 8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check for Right Adjacency:** Iterate through each green object. For each pixel in a green object, check if there is a pixel belonging to *any* azure object immediately to its right.
3.  **Change Color:** If a green pixel has an azure pixel to its right, change the green pixel's color to azure (8) in the output grid.
4. **All other pixels:** retain their original color.
