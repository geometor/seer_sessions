            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple mapping observed in the first example (3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6). However, subsequent examples reveal that this mapping is incomplete and incorrect. The code needs to learn a more comprehensive mapping that accounts for all the color transformations present across *all* training examples. The strategy is to identify the correct one-to-one mapping between input and output pixel values by analyzing all training examples. The second example shows that 8 stays 8 and the mapping expands. The third adds that 5 and 6 are unchanged and in the last example, 9->8 and 4->3 are unchanged.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary per example, including an analysis of what the correct mapping should be:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3, 1, 2\n    *   Output: 4, 5, 6\n    *   Mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6\n    *result:* correct\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 2, 3, 8\n    *   Output: 6, 4, 8\n    *   Mapping: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 8\n    *result:* 8 is unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5, 8, 6\n    *   Output: 5, 8, 6\n    *   Mapping: 5 -> 5, 8 -> 8, 6 -> 6\n    *result:* 5,8 and 6 are unchanged\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 9, 4, 2\n    *   Output: 9, 3, 6\n    *   Mapping: 9 -> 9, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6\n    *result:* 9->9, 4->4, 2->6\n\nCombining all observations, the correct and complete mapping appears to be:\n\n*   1 -> 5\n*   2 -> 6\n*   3 -> 4\n*   4 -> 3\n*   5 -> 5\n*   6 -> 6\n*   8 -> 8\n*   9 -> 9\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: 3x3 # All examples are 3x3\n      - values: integers 0-9 # Representing colors\n    transformations:\n      - type: one-to-one mapping\n        details: |\n          Each input value maps to a specific output value.\n          The mapping is consistent across all examples.\n        mapping:\n          1: 5\n          2: 6\n          3: 4\n          4: 3\n          5: 5\n          6: 6\n          8: 8\n          9: 9\n          # 7 and 0 is not observed in data. assumption is the identity x->x\n          7: 7\n          0: 0\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers (representing colors).\n2.  **Transformation:** Replace each integer in the input grid with its corresponding value according to the following mapping:\n    *   1 becomes 5\n    *   2 becomes 6\n    *   3 becomes 4\n    *   4 becomes 3\n    *   5 remains 5\n    *   6 remains 6\n    *    7 remains 7\n    *   8 remains 8\n    *   9 remains 9\n    *    0 remains 0\n3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the transformed integer values.\n\nThe program uses one to one mapping. Each number has a corresponding output.\n"
