Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.
Essentially, each number in the input grid is replaced by a different, specific number in the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified mapping.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Apply the mapping to each element of the grid
    output_grid[input_grid == 3] = 4
    output_grid[input_grid == 1] = 5
    output_grid[input_grid == 2] = 6

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simple mapping observed in the first example (3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6). However, subsequent examples reveal that this mapping is incomplete and incorrect. The code needs to learn a more comprehensive mapping that accounts for all the color transformations present across *all* training examples. The strategy is to identify the correct one-to-one mapping between input and output pixel values by analyzing all training examples. The second example shows that 8 stays 8 and the mapping expands. The third adds that 5 and 6 are unchanged and in the last example, 9->8 and 4->3 are unchanged.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary per example, including an analysis of what the correct mapping should be:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3, 1, 2
    *   Output: 4, 5, 6
    *   Mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6
    *result:* correct

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 2, 3, 8
    *   Output: 6, 4, 8
    *   Mapping: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 8
    *result:* 8 is unchanged.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5, 8, 6
    *   Output: 5, 8, 6
    *   Mapping: 5 -> 5, 8 -> 8, 6 -> 6
    *result:* 5,8 and 6 are unchanged

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 9, 4, 2
    *   Output: 9, 3, 6
    *   Mapping: 9 -> 9, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6
    *result:* 9->9, 4->4, 2->6

Combining all observations, the correct and complete mapping appears to be:

*   1 -> 5
*   2 -> 6
*   3 -> 4
*   4 -> 3
*   5 -> 5
*   6 -> 6
*   8 -> 8
*   9 -> 9

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 # All examples are 3x3
      - values: integers 0-9 # Representing colors
    transformations:
      - type: one-to-one mapping
        details: |
          Each input value maps to a specific output value.
          The mapping is consistent across all examples.
        mapping:
          1: 5
          2: 6
          3: 4
          4: 3
          5: 5
          6: 6
          8: 8
          9: 9
          # 7 and 0 is not observed in data. assumption is the identity x->x
          7: 7
          0: 0

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers (representing colors).
2.  **Transformation:** Replace each integer in the input grid with its corresponding value according to the following mapping:
    *   1 becomes 5
    *   2 becomes 6
    *   3 becomes 4
    *   4 becomes 3
    *   5 remains 5
    *   6 remains 6
    *    7 remains 7
    *   8 remains 8
    *   9 remains 9
    *    0 remains 0
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the transformed integer values.

The program uses one to one mapping. Each number has a corresponding output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
