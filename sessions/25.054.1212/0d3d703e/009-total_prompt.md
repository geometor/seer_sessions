Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program implements a simple color substitution. It takes a 3x3 grid of colored pixels as input.  For each pixel in the input grid, the program performs the following:

1.  Check the input color/number.
2.  If the color is red (2), replace it with magenta (6).
3.  If the color is green (3), replace it with yellow (4).
4.  If the color is azure (8), replace it with maroon (9).
5.  Maintain the original grid structure.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid by applying a color substitution cipher.
    """
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # define the color mapping
    color_map = {
        2: 6,  # red to magenta
        3: 4,  # green to yellow
        8: 9   # azure to maroon
    }

    # iterate through the grid and apply the color mapping
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
