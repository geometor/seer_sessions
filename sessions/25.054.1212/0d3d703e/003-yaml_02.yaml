observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 # All examples are 3x3
      - values: integers 0-9 # Representing colors
    transformations:
      - type: one-to-one mapping
        details: |
          Each input value maps to a specific output value.
          The mapping is consistent across all examples.
        mapping:
          1: 5
          2: 6
          3: 4
          4: 3
          5: 5
          6: 6
          8: 8
          9: 9
          # 7 and 0 is not observed in data. assumption is the identity x->x
          7: 7
          0: 0
