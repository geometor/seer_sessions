Non-white pixels within this input subgrid are converted to green in the output grid, while white pixels remain white.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis, that the transformation is based solely on the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input, is incorrect. While the output is indeed 4x4, and non-white pixels in the input *do* generally correspond to green pixels in the output, it's not a direct mapping of the top-left 4x4 section. The expected outputs contain green (3) pixels that do not correspond to the top-left 4x4 input subgrid.

The strategy will involve re-examining the relationship between the input and output grids to find a more accurate rule. The input grids are larger than 4x4, and the output grid is exactly 4x4, indicating downsampling. The rule must describe downsampling and use a method for mapping non-white to green.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 9x4
    *   Output Size: 4x4
    *   Mismatch Locations (Transformed vs. Expected): (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1,3), (2,2)
    * Observations: Output is almost correct, except the white (0) pixels should extend into the third column.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 9x4
    *   Output Size: 4x4
    *   Mismatch Locations: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1)
    *   Observations: The third column is correct.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 9x4
    *   Output Size: 4x4
    *   Mismatch Locations: (0, 3)
    *   Observations: Almost perfect except (0,3) should be 3, not 0.

*   **Example 4:**
    *    Input Size: 9x4
    *    Output Size: 4x4
    *   Mismatch Locations: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2)
    *   Observations:

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Downsampling:** The input grid is downsampled to a 4x4 output grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Any non-white pixel (1-9) within the input grid results in a green pixel (3) in the output at a corresponding downsampled location
    * any white pixel (0) within the input grid results in a white pixel (0) at a corresponding downsampled location.
3. It appears that the top-left 4x4 section of the input determines the output grid, and the rest of the grid is not used.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
