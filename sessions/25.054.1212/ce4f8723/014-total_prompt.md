## Example 3

**input:**
```
1 1 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1
4 4 4 4
2 2 0 2
0 0 2 0
0 2 0 0
2 0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC47578E20>

**output:**
```
3 3 0 3
3 0 3 0
3 3 0 3
3 3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4757BE80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a larger grid composed of visually distinct sections. The output is a smaller grid. There's a clear relationship between the size and content of the input and output. The top portion of the input seems to be the main focus, with the bottom sections seeming to play a secondary role. Specifically the first 4 rows x 4 columns seems to translate directly to the output, with values of `1` becoming `3`.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, yellow, red]
      - dimensions: 9x4
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [white, green]
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - values: [0, 3]
  - name: subgrid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - parent: input_grid
      - location: top-left 4x4
      - values: contains only 0, 1

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    agent: system
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      - row_start: 0
      - row_end: 4
      - col_start: 0
      - col_end: 4
    output: subgrid

  - name: recolor_subgrid
    agent: system
    input: subgrid
    parameters:
        - original_color: 1
        - new_color: 3

relationships:
  - type: size_reduction
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
  - type: color_mapping
    from: subgrid
    to: output_grid
  - type: value_correspondence
    details: "1 in input maps to 3 in output, 0 remains 0."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.
2.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted subgrid, replace all occurrences of the value '1' (blue) with the value '3' (green). The value '0' (white) should remain unchanged.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid after the recoloring is the output.

Essentially the program extracts a portion of the input grid, and does a recoloring of one of the colors to another, and provides the result as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
