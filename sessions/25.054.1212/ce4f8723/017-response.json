            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to refine the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the 4x4 subgrid extraction and the initial blue-to-green color change, it failed to accurately model the propagation rule. The original propagation rule was overly aggressive, changing *all* white neighbors to green. The examples demonstrate a more nuanced propagation: It seems green only propagates to white pixels if they are *adjacent* to a pixel that was *originally* blue and became green. The code changes all white neighbors which is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Refine Propagation Rule:** The core issue is the propagation. We need to modify the rule to reflect that only the neighbors of *originally blue* pixels (which turned green) that are white should turn green. The current code incorrectly stores this but uses it in the incorrect spot.\n2. **Check Examples:** Carefully re-examine the examples and how the green color spreads to make sure the rule is accurate.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the propagation:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,2)\n    *   Propagation observations:\n        *   (0,0) -> (0,2) white turns to green\n        *   (0,1) -> (0,2) & (0,3) white turns to green\n        *   (1,1) -> no change to (1,0) black or (1,2) white\n        *   (2,1) -> no change to (2,0) or (2,2)\n        *    (3,0) -> no change to (3,1)\n        *    (3,2) -> no change to (3,1) or (3,3)\n*   **Example 2:**\n     *  Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3)\n    *   Propagation observations:\n        *   (0,2) -> (0,3) white turns green\n        *    (2,2) -> (2,1) doesn't propagate since it isn't white\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n    *   Propagation observations:\n      * (0,1) changes (0,2) to green\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n     *  Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)\n    *   Propagation observations:\n         *  (0,0) changes (0,1) white\n         *  (1,1) changes (1,2)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      colors: [0-9] # All possible colors\n      dimensions: variable\n\n  - name: subgrid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: 4x4\n      source: top-left corner of input_grid\n\n  - name: blue_pixels\n    type: pixel_set\n    properties:\n      original_color: 1 # Blue\n      new_color: 3 # Green\n      locations: []\n\n  - name: white_pixels\n    type: pixel_set\n    properties:\n      color: 0\n\n  - name: changed_pixels\n    type: pixel_set\n    properties: {}\n\nactions:\n  - name: extract_subgrid\n    input: input_grid\n    output: subgrid\n\n  - name: recolor_blue\n    input: subgrid\n    process:\n      - Find all pixels with color 1 (blue)\n      - Change their color to 3 (green)\n      - Store original locations of these blue pixels\n    output: modified subgrid\n\n  - name: propagate_green\n    input:\n      - modified subgrid\n      - locations of originally blue pixels\n    process:\n      - For each originally blue pixel:\n        - Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n        - If a neighbor is white (0), change it to green (3).\n    output: final_output_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.\n2.  **Recolor Blue Pixels:** Within the extracted subgrid, locate all blue (1) pixels. Change these pixels to green (3). *Crucially*, record the original locations of these blue pixels *before* they were changed.\n3.  **Propagate Green Conditionally:** Iterate through the *original* locations of the blue pixels (now green). For *each* of these locations:\n    *   Check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).\n    *   If a neighboring pixel is white (0), change it to green (3).\n    *   If a neighbor is any other color, do *not* change it.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid, after the recoloring and conditional propagation, is the output.\n\nThe key improvement is step 3, clearly specifying that propagation is tied to the *original* blue pixel locations, and not just any green pixel.\n"
