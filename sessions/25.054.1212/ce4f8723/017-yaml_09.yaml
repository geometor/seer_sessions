  - name: recolor_blue
    input: subgrid
    process:
      - Find all pixels with color 1 (blue)
      - Change their color to 3 (green)
      - Store original locations of these blue pixels
    output: modified subgrid

  - name: propagate_green
    input:
      - modified subgrid
      - locations of originally blue pixels
    process:
      - For each originally blue pixel:
        - Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        - If a neighbor is white (0), change it to green (3).
