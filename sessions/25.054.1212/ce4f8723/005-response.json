            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis, that the transformation is based solely on the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input, is incorrect. While the output is indeed 4x4, and non-white pixels in the input *do* generally correspond to green pixels in the output, it's not a direct mapping of the top-left 4x4 section. The expected outputs contain green (3) pixels that do not correspond to the top-left 4x4 input subgrid.\n\nThe strategy will involve re-examining the relationship between the input and output grids to find a more accurate rule. The input grids are larger than 4x4, and the output grid is exactly 4x4, indicating downsampling. The rule must describe downsampling and use a method for mapping non-white to green.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Mismatch Locations (Transformed vs. Expected): (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1,3), (2,2)\n    * Observations: Output is almost correct, except the white (0) pixels should extend into the third column.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Mismatch Locations: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1)\n    *   Observations: The third column is correct.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 9x4\n    *   Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Mismatch Locations: (0, 3)\n    *   Observations: Almost perfect except (0,3) should be 3, not 0.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input Size: 9x4\n    *    Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Mismatch Locations: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2)\n    *   Observations:\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 004-py_02\nexamples:\n  - input_size: 9x4\n    output_size: 4x4\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    transformation: |\n      Downsamples the input grid to a 4x4 output grid. \n      Non-white pixels in the input generally map to green pixels in the output.\n      The rule is not a direct mapping of the input's top-left 4x4 subgrid.\n  - input_size: 9x4\n    output_size: 4x4\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    transformation: |\n      Downsamples the input grid to a 4x4 output grid.\n      Non-white pixels in the input generally map to green pixels in the output.\n      The rule is not a direct mapping of the input's top-left 4x4 subgrid.\n\n  - input_size: 9x4\n    output_size: 4x4\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    transformation: |\n      Downsamples the input grid to a 4x4 output grid.\n      Non-white pixels in the input generally map to green pixels in the output.\n      The rule is not a direct mapping of the input's top-left 4x4 subgrid.\n  - input_size: 9x4\n    output_size: 4x4\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    transformation: |\n        Downsamples the input to 4x4 output\n        All non-white pixels in input are green in the output.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Downsampling:** The input grid is downsampled to a 4x4 output grid.\n2.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Any non-white pixel (1-9) within the input grid results in a green pixel (3) in the output at a corresponding downsampled location\n    * any white pixel (0) within the input grid results in a white pixel (0) at a corresponding downsampled location.\n3. It appears that the top-left 4x4 section of the input determines the output grid, and the rest of the grid is not used.\n\n"
