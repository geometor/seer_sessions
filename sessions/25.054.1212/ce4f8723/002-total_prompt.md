## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 0 0
0 1 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0
4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2
0 0 2 2
2 2 0 0
0 0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC4757E500>

**output:**
```
3 3 3 3
0 3 3 3
3 3 0 0
3 0 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4757C340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be primarily green (3) and white (0). There's a clear reduction in size, suggesting a downscaling or summarizing operation. The colors in the input grid do not seem to have a directly corresponding color in the output, so some relationship between areas of the larger grid map to specific color values in the smaller grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x4 (rows x columns)
      - colors: [blue, white, yellow, red]
      - values: [1, 0, 4, 2]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [green, white]
      - values: [3, 0]

  - observation:
    description: size reduction
    details: The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Input rows are more than output rows, while input and output columns are the same.

  - observation:
      description: upper left corner input
      details: the upper left 4x4 subgrid of the input becomes the output

  - observation:
    description: color mapping
    details: |
      All colors other than white (0) become green (3) in the output, and all whites remain white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on a Subgrid:** Consider only the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input grid.
2.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   If a pixel in the subgrid is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel in the subgrid has any color other than white (i.e. 1, 2, or 4), it becomes green (3) in the output grid.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
