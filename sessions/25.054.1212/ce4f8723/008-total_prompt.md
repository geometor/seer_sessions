## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1
4 4 4 4
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 2
2 2 2 2
2 2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC4757E500>

**output:**
```
3 3 3 3
0 3 0 3
3 3 3 3
3 3 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4757CD90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain multiple colored regions (represented by different digits). The output grid seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of a specific section of the input grid, with a single color dominating. The specific area that the output grid comes from is probably important.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 9x4
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        - contains distinct colored regions
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      properties:
        - appears to be derived from a section of the input_grid
        - predominantly a single color (green/3)

relationships:
  - output_grid_derives_from_input_grid:
      type: spatial_subset
      details: The output grid's content matches a 4x4 region in the upper section of the input grid. The colors in input region are replaced.

actions:
  - extraction:
      description: A 4x4 section is extracted from the input.
      parameters:
        start_row: 0
        end_row: 3
        start_col: 0
        end_col: 3
  - color_replacement:
        blue is changed to green
        white is white

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate the 4x4 subgrid at the top-left of the input grid. The target region starts at row 0, column 0 and extends to row 3, column 3.
2.  **Extract:** Extract this 4x4 region.
3.  **Color Mapping/Replacement:**
    *   If a cell in the extracted region is blue (1), change it to green (3).
    *   If a cell is white(0), keep it white(0).

Essentially, the transformation extracts the top-left 4x4 portion of the input grid and then recolors it based on very simple rules.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
