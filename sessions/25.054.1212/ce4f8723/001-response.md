Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be primarily green (3) and white (0). There's a clear reduction in size, suggesting a downscaling or summarizing operation. The colors in the input grid do not seem to have a directly corresponding color in the output, so some relationship between areas of the larger grid map to specific color values in the smaller grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x4 (rows x columns)
      - colors: [blue, white, yellow, red]
      - values: [1, 0, 4, 2]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [green, white]
      - values: [3, 0]

  - observation:
    description: size reduction
    details: The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Input rows are more than output rows, while input and output columns are the same.

  - observation:
      description: upper left corner input
      details: the upper left 4x4 subgrid of the input becomes the output

  - observation:
    description: color mapping
    details: |
      All colors other than white (0) become green (3) in the output, and all whites remain white.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on a Subgrid:** Consider only the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input grid.
2.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   If a pixel in the subgrid is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel in the subgrid has any color other than white (i.e. 1, 2, or 4), it becomes green (3) in the output grid.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 grid is the output.
