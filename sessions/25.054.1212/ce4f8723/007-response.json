The input grid appears to contain multiple colored regions (represented by different digits). The output grid seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of a specific section of the input grid, with a single color dominating. The specific area that the output grid comes from is probably important.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The target region starts at row 0, column 0 and extends to row 3, column 3.\n2.  **Extract:** Extract this 4x4 region.\n3.  **Color Mapping/Replacement:**\n    *   If a cell in the extracted region is blue (1), change it to green (3).\n    *   If a cell is white(0), keep it white(0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the top-left 4x4 portion of the input grid and then recolors it based on very simple rules.\n"
