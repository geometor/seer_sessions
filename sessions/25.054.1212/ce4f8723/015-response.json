However, it appears there's an issue with consistently applying a secondary rule. Looking at all provided example, a pattern emerges where ALL blue pixels become green, even those that were originally white become green. The original natural language program was under-specified.\n\nThe primary strategy will be to revise the natural language program to correctly apply a change where ALL blue pixels in the subgrid change to green.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on identifying the core issue:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The transformation failed because there is one white pixel in output that should be green.\n*   **Example 2:** The transformation failed because 2 white pixels were not changed to green.\n*   **Example 3:** The transformation failed because 1 of 8 white pixels were not changed to green.\n*   **Example 4:** The transformation failed because 3 white pixels were not changed to green.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"ARC-AGI Task 014\"\n  - objective: \"Transform input grid to output grid based on subgrid extraction and color mapping.\"\n  - input_grid_size: \"Variable, up to 30x30\"\n  - output_grid_size: \"4x4\"\n  - subgrid_extraction: \"Top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input.\"\n  - color_mapping_rule: \"All blue (1) pixels in input are changed to green(3), White pixels in output are all associated with blue pixels that were converted to green\"\n  - original_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]\n  - transformed_colors: [0,3]\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.\n2.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted subgrid, replace all occurrences of the value '1' (blue) with the value '3' (green). identify all places where the value '1' was changed to a '3'.\n3.  **Propagate:** Where a 1 was changed to a 3, and there are any adjacent white pixels, change those to green (3)\n4.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid after the recoloring is the output.\n"
