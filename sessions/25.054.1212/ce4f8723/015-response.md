Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identified the subgrid extraction and the color replacement of blue (1) with green (3). However, it appears there's an issue with consistently applying a secondary rule. Looking at all provided example, a pattern emerges where ALL blue pixels become green, even those that were originally white become green. The original natural language program was under-specified.

The primary strategy will be to revise the natural language program to correctly apply a change where ALL blue pixels in the subgrid change to green.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on identifying the core issue:

*   **Example 1:** The transformation failed because there is one white pixel in output that should be green.
*   **Example 2:** The transformation failed because 2 white pixels were not changed to green.
*   **Example 3:** The transformation failed because 1 of 8 white pixels were not changed to green.
*   **Example 4:** The transformation failed because 3 white pixels were not changed to green.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "ARC-AGI Task 014"
  - objective: "Transform input grid to output grid based on subgrid extraction and color mapping."
  - input_grid_size: "Variable, up to 30x30"
  - output_grid_size: "4x4"
  - subgrid_extraction: "Top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input."
  - color_mapping_rule: "All blue (1) pixels in input are changed to green(3), White pixels in output are all associated with blue pixels that were converted to green"
  - original_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]
  - transformed_colors: [0,3]
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.
2.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted subgrid, replace all occurrences of the value '1' (blue) with the value '3' (green). identify all places where the value '1' was changed to a '3'.
3.  **Propagate:** Where a 1 was changed to a 3, and there are any adjacent white pixels, change those to green (3)
4.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid after the recoloring is the output.
