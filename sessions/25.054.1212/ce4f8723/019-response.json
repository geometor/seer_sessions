The colors in the input are varied (blue, white, yellow, red), whereas the output primarily uses green (represented by the number 3) and a single white pixel. The output dimensions are significantly smaller than the input. It appears some sort of compression of regions with specific rules are occurring.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
