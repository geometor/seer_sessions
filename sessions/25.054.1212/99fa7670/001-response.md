Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 2D grids of pixels, each with a 6x6 dimension. The input grid contains a red pixel (value 2) and a green pixel (value 3), with the rest being white (value 0). The output grid shows the red and green pixels expanding, seemingly filling the right side of the grids from their initial position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, red, green]
      value: [0, 2, 3]
      position: [row, column] # (x, y) coordinates
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 6] # height, width

actions:
  - name: expand_right
    description:  A colored pixel's value propagates to the right, filling cells until the edge of the grid or another non-white pixel is encountered, based on its row.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  Pixels occupy positions within the grid. The red and green pixel initiate and their location determine the rows that fill.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** non-white pixels (red and green) in the input grid.
2.  **For each** identified pixel:
    *   **Locate** its row.
    *    From initial pixel, fill to the right with initial color/value to the right edge of that row.
3. **Repeat** steps one and two for next rows.
4. **Return** updated grid.

In essence, each colored (non-white) pixel in the input acts as a "seed" that "grows" to the right, filling its respective row in the output grid. The growth stops at the boundaries and other filled areas.
