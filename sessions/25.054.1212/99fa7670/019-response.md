Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, with most pixels being white (0). The input grid contains a few isolated pixels of different colors (orange (7), azure (8), and magenta (6)). The output grid shows that those colored pixels expanded.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - orange (7)
        - azure (8)
        - magenta (6)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Colored pixels expand to fill the space to the right boundary.
    constraints:
      - Expansion occurs only for non-white pixels.
      - expansion stops when a non-white pixel is encountered to the right

relationships:
  - spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - adjacency: Expansion is influenced by adjacent pixels to the right.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is not white (0), proceed to the next step.
2.  **Expand to the Right:** For each non-white pixel, change the color of the pixels to its right in same row, to the same color, until a the end of row or another non-white pixel is encountered.
3.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

Essentially, each colored pixel initiates a horizontal "flood fill" to the right, stopping at the edge of the grid or when another colored pixel is present.
