The input grid contains a single magenta (color value 6) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (color value 0) pixels. The output grid retains the central magenta pixel and adds two more magenta pixels: one to the right of the original, and one below it. The added pixels form a sort of \"L\" shape, or perhaps more abstractly, they propagate the initial pixel's color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
