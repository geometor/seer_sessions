Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with an updated natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track but failed to accurately capture the nuanced interaction between horizontal expansion and fill-down operations. The code performs both operations independently, causing an "over-expansion" where colors spread incorrectly. The core issue is that the fill-down operation should only apply to the *original* non-zero pixels, not the ones created by horizontal expansion. The examples show the algorithm needs to consider horizontal expansion, but restrict vertical fill-down to the columns of original non-zero pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine the Fill-Down Logic:** Modify the code to ensure that the fill-down operation is strictly linked to the *original* positions of the non-zero pixels. This means storing the initial column positions and only using them for the vertical expansion.

2. **Prioritize Operations**: Horizontal expansion is applied fully across a row, but the vertical "fill-down" is applied to a specific column.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Non-zero Pixels (original): (1, 2, red), (3, 1, green)
    *   Expected Behavior: Red expands horizontally and then the original red column fills down. Green expands horizontally, then original green column fills down.
    *   Observed Error: Fill-down affects columns where horizontal expansion happened.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Non-zero Pixels (original): (1, 1, magenta)
    *   Expected Behavior: Magenta expands horizontally and then the original magenta column fills down.
    *   Observed Error: Same as Example 1.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Non-zero Pixels (original): (1, 1, azure), (4, 3, yellow)
    *   Expected Behavior: Similar pattern, horizontal expansion then restricted vertical fill.
    *   Observed Error: Same as Example 1.
*   **Example 4:**
    *  Input shape: (7,5)
    *  Non-zero pixels: (1,2, azure), (3,1, orange), (5,2, magenta)
    *  Expected Behavior: Similar to other examples
    *  Observed Error: Same as other examples

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - task_id: 014
  - objects:
    - description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
      properties:
        - color: Defined by the pixel value (1-9).
        - original_position: (row, column) coordinates before any transformation.
  - actions:
    - name: Horizontal Expansion
      description:  A non-zero pixel's color replaces all 0 values in its row.
      scope: Row-level.
      precedence: Happens before fill-down.
    - name: Fill Down
      description: A non-zero pixel's color propagates vertically downwards from its original row.
      scope:  Column-level, limited to the original column of the non-zero pixel.
      precedence: Happens after horizontal expansion.
  - constraints:
     - Fill-down is constrained to the column of the original non-zero colored pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0). Record their color and original (row, column) position.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each non-zero pixel, set all pixels in its row to that pixel's color.

3.  **Restricted Fill-Down:** For each non-zero pixel identified in step 1, starting from its *original* row and *original* column, fill downwards in that column with the pixel's color until the bottom of the grid is reached.  This fill-down only occurs in the columns where non-zero pixels originally existed.
