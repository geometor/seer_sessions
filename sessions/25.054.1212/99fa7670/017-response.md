Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was on the right track, identifying the core idea of horizontal and vertical expansion based on non-zero pixels. However, it incorrectly applied these expansions. The horizontal expansion worked correctly, filling the entire row with the color of the non-zero pixel. But, The vertical fill-down incorrectly uses horizontal information from the fill. The fill-down needs to fill down *only* from the original position of the non-zero pixels, and not any position changed by other effects, so we'll adjust how fill down uses non-zero pixel coordinates.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Preserve Original Coordinates:** The key error is that the fill-down operation is affected by the horizontal expansion. We must ensure the fill-down only uses the *original* column of the non-zero pixel. The current code already does this by storing them in `non_zero_pixels`, but it combines horizontal and fill-down effects.
2.  **Refine Fill-Down Logic**: Ensure that, after the horizontal expansion is complete, the fill-down occurs *only* in the original columns where the non-zero pixels were located, and uses only the original coordinates.
3. **Correct Combining Horizontal and Vertical Effects**: The effects should be combined in stages, horizontal first, then fill-down.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two non-zero pixels (2 and 3).
    *   Horizontal expansion is correct.
    *   Fill-down uses the horizontally expanded information
    *   Pixels off: 12

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has one non-zero pixel (6).
    *   Horizontal expansion is correct
    *   Fill-down uses horizontally expanded information
    *   Pixels off: 3

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has two non-zero pixels (8 and 5).
    *   Horizontal expansion is correct.
    *   Fill-down uses horizontally expanded information
    *   Pixels off: 11

*   **Example 4:**
    *    Input has three non-zero pixels (8, 7, and 6)
    *   Horizontal expansion is correct.
    *   Fill-down uses horizontally expanded information
    *   Pixels off: 14

            Non-zero pixels trigger both horizontal and restricted vertical
            expansions. Horizontal expansion fills the entire row. Vertical
            expansion fills downwards from the original pixel position to the
            bottom of the grid, and only in that column.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0). Note their color and their original row and column position.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each non-zero pixel, change all pixels in its row to that pixel's color.

3.  **Restricted Vertical Expansion (Fill-Down):** For each non-zero pixel identified in step 1, fill downwards *from its original row and column position*. The fill color is the color of the original non-zero pixel. The fill extends to the bottom of the grid, but *only* within that original column. Do not use any horizontally changed values for fill down.
