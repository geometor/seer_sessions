The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 3x6. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0) and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve some form of duplication and insertion of additional white and orange pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In the output grid, maintain the orange pixels in their original positions.\n3.  **Insert White Pixels:** add white pixels beside white, copy the new orange pixels to be after the originals.\n\nEssentially, the transformation doubles the width, copies the orange pattern to the right.\n"
