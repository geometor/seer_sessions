## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 1 2 1 4
4 4 2 4 8
3 7 2 4 8
2 7 7 8 7
8 7 7 4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC441A05E0>

**output:**
```
8 7 7 4 8
2 7 7 8 7
3 7 2 4 8
4 4 2 4 8
8 1 2 1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC441A3E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a spatial manipulation, specifically a reflection or rotation. The colors themselves remain unchanged; only their positions within the grid are altered. The dimensions of the grid (5x5) are preserved.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    transformation: spatial manipulation
    invariance: color of individual pixels
    operation:  mirror the grid with input as the bottom, output is the top
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a vertical reflection (flip) of the grid. The output grid is created by mirroring the input grid along a horizontal axis positioned in the middle. Think of this as flipping the rows.

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Reverse order of rows
3.  The result is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
