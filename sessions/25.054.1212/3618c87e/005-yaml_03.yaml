task: 004
objects:
  - color: blue
    shape: pixel
    initial_positions: varies  # Positions vary per example, as noted above
    behavior: "Moves down one row if a gray pixel is directly below it."
  - color: gray
    shape: pixel
    initial_positions: varies  # Positions vary per example, as noted above.  Crucially, there's a row of gray pixels at the bottom initially.
    behavior: "Moves up one row if it's directly below a blue pixel."
transformation_type: swapping
action: |
    If a blue pixel has a gray pixel directly below it, they swap positions.  The blue pixel moves down one row, and the gray pixel moves up one row.
