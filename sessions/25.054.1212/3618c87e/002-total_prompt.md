## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 5 0 0
5 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC48A623B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 0 0
5 5 1 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC48A62830>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 5x5 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).  The input and output grids are mostly identical except for the bottom row and, specifically, a central element that swaps colors between gray and blue.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 5x5.
  - observation: |
      Most of the pixels are the same color in both input and output grids.
      The exception appears to be on the bottom row.
  - object: |
      A blue (1) pixel at position (2,2) in the input.
  - object: |
      A grey (5) pixel at position (3,2) in the input.
  - object: |
      A row of grey (5) pixels in the last row of the input.
  - object: |
      A grey (5) pixel at position (2,2) in the output.
    change: |
      color changed from blue to gray
  - object: |
      a blue (1) pixel at position (4,2) in the output.
    change: |
      color changed from gray to blue
  - relationship:
      The blue pixel and a grey pixel appear to swap positions between the input and output grids.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the blue (1) pixel in the input grid. Note its position, and note the position of the gray (5) below it.
2.  **Swap Colors:** In the output grid:
    *   Change the color of the pixel in the position of the original blue pixel, to gray (5).
    *   Change the color of the previously-gray pixel directly below the original blue pixel, to blue (1).
3.  **Copy Remainder:** All other pixels remain unchanged from input to output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
