The most obvious changes are:\n\n1.  **Color Swapping:**  Blue (1) and gray (5) pixels appear to swap positions, but not all instances, and based on location.\n2.  **Row-Specific Changes:** The transformation seems specific to certain rows. The top three rows are unchanged.\n3. **Symmetry**: There is a mirrored swap in the last two rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
