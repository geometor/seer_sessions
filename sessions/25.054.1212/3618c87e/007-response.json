The colors present are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5). The primary change seems to be a swapping of colors between blue (1) and gray (5) in specific locations, with white (0) remaining unchanged. The positions of the changed colors appear related; where blue was in the input, grey takes is place in the output and vice-versa. The overall structure is kept intact.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
