## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 5 0 5 0
5 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4757CC40>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 5 0
5 1 5 1 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4757E9B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5). The primary change seems to be a swapping of colors between blue (1) and gray (5) in specific locations, with white (0) remaining unchanged. The positions of the changed colors appear related; where blue was in the input, grey takes is place in the output and vice-versa. The overall structure is kept intact.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements: pixels
      colors: [white, blue, gray]

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        blue: 1
        gray: 5
      position: [row, column]

  - action: swap_colors
    description: Swaps the colors of specific pixels.
    input_color_1: blue
    output_color_1: gray
    input_color_2: gray
    output_color_2: blue
    condition: "If a pixel in the input grid is input_color_1 then it will become output_color_1 in the output grid. If a pixel in the input grid is input_color_2, then it will become output_color_2 in the output grid."

  - observation: unchanged_color
    color: white
    description: Pixels with the color white remain unchanged.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel:
    *   If the pixel is blue (1), change it to gray (5) in the output grid.
    *   If the pixel is gray (5), change it to blue (1) in the output grid.
    *   If the pixel is white (0), keep it as white (0) in the output grid.
3.  **Maintain** the original grid structure and dimensions. The transformation involves only color changes in specific locations, leaving the grid layout unchanged.

Essentially the algorithm will perform a color swap between Blue and Gray, keeping everything else the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
