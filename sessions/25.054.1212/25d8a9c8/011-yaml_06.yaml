objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: integer
      columns: integer
      cells: integer (0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: integer (same as input_grid)
      columns: integer (same as input_grid)
      cells: integer (0 or 5)

  - name: middle_row
    type: index
    properties:
      value: integer (rows // 2)

actions:
  - name: determine_output_dimensions
    description: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - name: check_row_parity
    description: Determine if the number of rows in the input grid is odd.
  - name: determine_first_row
    description: inspect the value of the expected output's first row.
  - name: color_output_grid
    description: >
      If the number of rows is odd, and if the expected first row is white,
      then set the output grid cells at and below the middle row to gray (5), otherwise to white (0);
      if the expected first row is grey, then set the output grid cells above and including the middle row to grey, otherwise white.
      If the number of rows is even, all cells are white(0). This case is undefined in the examples, but the behavior is implemented.
