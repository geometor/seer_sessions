            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too specific, focusing on the color transformations present only in the first example. The subsequent examples revealed that the transformation rules aren't universally applied to all colors as initially thought. Specifically, the code needs to accurately map not only colors 2,3,4, but any colors in the input, including those in other examples.\n\nIt seems the original strategy over generalized the rule - my goal should be to\nfind the simplest set of rules that matches the examples, and not just\nextrapolate from the first example.\n\nI need to rethink my assumptions and adjust the program. The rules need to account for the changes seen in ALL training examples and identify the correct mapping for each color.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the results of the generated code:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code works perfectly, matching the expected output.\n*   **Example 2:** The code fails. It changes green (3) to white (0) correctly,\n    but incorrectly handles other colors. Specifically, it does not transform,\n    6 to 5 or 7 or to anything, whereas they become '5' and '7' respectively in\n    the expected output.\n*   **Example 3:** The code fails. Changes red (2) to white (0) and yellow (4)\n    to gray (5), but incorrectly leaves the 9s, rather than changing them to 5\n    like the expected output.\n*    **Example 4:** Gray pixels should have been transformed, along with the reds\n    and yellows, but weren't\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1: { color: 4, shape: rectangle, position: row_1 } # Yellow row\n        - object_2: { color: 2/3, shape: rectangle, position: rows_2-3 } # Red/Green rows\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1: { color: 5, shape: rectangle, position: row_1 } # Gray row\n        - object_2: { color: 0, shape: rectangle, position: rows_2-3 } # White rows\n      transformation: color_replacement\n  - example_2:\n    input_objects:\n        - object_1: {color: 7, shape: rectangle, postion: row_1_col_1}\n        - object_2: {color: 3, shape: rectangle, postion: row_1_cols_2-3}\n        - object_3: {color: 6, shape: rectangle, position: row_2}\n        - object_4: {color: 3, shape: rectangle, postion: row_3_cols_1}\n        - object_5: {color: 7, shape: rectangle, postion: row_3_cols_2-3}\n    output_objects:\n        - object_1: {color: 7, shape: rectangle, postion: row_1_col_1}\n        - object_2: {color: 0, shape: rectangle, postion: row_1_cols_2-3}\n        - object_3: {color: 5, shape: rectangle, position: row_2}\n        - object_4: {color: 0, shape: rectangle, postion: row_3_cols_1}\n        - object_5: {color: 7, shape: rectangle, postion: row_3_cols_2-3}\n    transformation: color_replacement\n\n  - example_3:\n      input_objects:\n        - object_1: { color: 2, shape: rectangle, position: row_1_cols_1&3 }\n        - object_2: { color: 9, shape: rectangle, position: row_1_col_2 }\n        - object_3: { color: 4, shape: rectangle, position: row_2 }\n        - object_4: { color: 9, shape: rectangle, position: row_3 }\n      output_objects:\n        - object_1: { color: 0, shape: rectangle, position: row_1_cols_1&3 }\n        - object_2: { color: 9, shape: rectangle, position: row_1_col_2 }\n        - object_3: { color: 5, shape: rectangle, position: row_2 }\n        - object_4: { color: 5, shape: rectangle, position: row_3 }\n      transformation: color_replacement\n  - example_4:\n    input_objects:\n      - object_1: {color: 2, shape: rectangle, position: top_left_2x2}\n      - object_2: {color: 4, shape: rectangle, position: top_right_2x1}\n      - object_3: {color: 1, shape: rectangle, position: bottom_row}\n\n    output_objects:\n      - object_1: {color: 0, shape: rectangle, position: top_left_2x2}\n      - object_2: {color: 5, shape: rectangle, position: top_right_2x1}\n      - object_3: {color: 1, shape: rectangle, position: bottom_row}\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule performs a color replacement based on these observed\nmappings:\n\n1.  Yellow (4) in the input becomes gray (5) in the output.\n2.  Red (2) or Green (3) in the input becomes white (0) in the output.\n3.  Maroon(9) becomes gray (5).\n4.  Blue(1) remains blue(1).\n5.  Gray(6) remains gray(5)\n6.  Orange(7) becomes orange(7)\n\nEssentially, it seems that a simple map can be built.\n\nIt appears that pixels are mapped according to the following rule:\n\n-   If the input pixel is 4, change it to 5.\n-   If the input pixel is 2 or 3, change it to 0.\n-  If the input pixel is 9, change to 5\n-   Otherwise, keep original values.\n"
