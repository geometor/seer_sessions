The input grid contains a variety of colors (red, maroon, yellow), while the output grid contains only two colors (white, gray). The spatial arrangement of pixels seems to matter, as does the original color. There appears to be a consolidation or simplification of colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
