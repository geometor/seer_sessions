Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule performs a color mapping on the input grid to produce the output grid. The following color transformations are applied:

1.  Orange (7) becomes White (0).
2.  Green (3) becomes White (0).
3.  Gray (6) becomes Gray (5).
4.  Red (2) becomes White (0).
5.  Maroon (9) becomes White (0).
6.  Yellow (4) becomes Gray (5).
7.  Blue (1) becomes Gray(5).

Essentially, the color changes consolidate several related colors into color
that is similar, and makes many of the colors white.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs a color mapping, and it works correctly for Examples 1 and 2. However, it fails on Examples 3 and 4. The primary issue is that the color mapping isn't consistently applied. Specifically, Example 3 reveals an error in how maroon (9) is handled, it should turn to grey, and example 4 reveals that yellow(4) should turn to grey.

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Re-examine the color mappings:** Carefully review *all* input-output pairs to identify the *complete and correct* set of color transformations. It seems my initial observation was incomplete.
2.  **Update the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to reflect the corrected color mapping rules.
3. **Metrics** develop a report for the success and error metrics for each example

**Metrics Report**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including calculated metrics, and a description of what needs to change:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Calculates and prints metrics for a single example."""

    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, transformed_output)
    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    size_correct = expected_output.shape == transformed_output.shape
    # Compare color palettes, ignoring order and duplicates
    color_palette_correct = set(np.unique(expected_output)) == set(np.unique(transformed_output))
    
    expected_counts = {color: np.sum(expected_output == color) for color in np.unique(expected_output)}
    transformed_counts = {color: np.sum(transformed_output == color) for color in np.unique(transformed_output)}

    correct_pixel_counts = expected_counts == transformed_counts


    print(f"  match: {match}")
    print(f"  pixels_off: {pixels_off}")
    print(f"  size_correct: {size_correct}")
    print(f"  color_palette_correct: {color_palette_correct}")
    print(f"  correct_pixel_counts: {correct_pixel_counts}")

    if not match:
        print(" Discrepancies:")
        for x in range(expected_output.shape[0]):
            for y in range(expected_output.shape[1]):
                if expected_output[x,y] != transformed_output[x,y]:
                    print(f"    Pixel at ({x},{y}): Expected {expected_output[x,y]}, Got {transformed_output[x,y]}")
                    
# Example Data (recreated for completeness) - replace with your actual data loading
examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[4, 4, 4], [2, 3, 2], [2, 3, 3]]),
        "expected": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[7, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6], [3, 7, 7]]),
        "expected": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 9, 2], [4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9]]),
        "expected": np.array([[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0]]),
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 2, 4], [2, 2, 4], [1, 1, 1]]),
        "expected": np.array([[0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
    },
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    calculate_metrics(example["input"], example["expected"], example["transformed"])

```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_set: "Train"
  - task: "Color Mapping"
  - objects:
      - description: "Pixels in a grid"
        properties:
          - color: "Represents a value from 0-9, mapped to a specific color."
          - position: "(row, column) coordinates within the grid."
  - actions:
      - name: "Color Transformation"
        description: "Change the color of a pixel based on a predefined mapping."
        rules:
          - input_color: "Orange (7)"
            output_color: "White (0)"
          - input_color: "Green (3)"
            output_color: "White (0)"
          - input_color: "Gray (6)"
            output_color: "Gray (5)"
          - input_color: "Red (2)"
            output_color: "White (0)"
          - input_color: "Maroon (9)"
            output_color: "Gray (5)"  # Corrected
          - input_color: "Yellow (4)"
            output_color: "Gray (5)"  # Corrected
          - input_color: "Blue (1)"
            output_color: "Gray (5)"
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is a color mapping applied to each pixel of the input grid. The mapping is as follows:

1.  Orange (7) pixels become White (0).
2.  Green (3) pixels become White (0).
3.  Gray (6) pixels become Gray (5).
4.  Red (2) pixels become White (0).
5.  Maroon (9) pixels become Gray (5).
6.  Yellow (4) pixels become Gray (5).
7.  Blue (1) pixels become Gray (5).
8.  All other colors remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
