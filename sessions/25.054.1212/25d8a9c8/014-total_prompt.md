## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 4
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F932E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63130>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels.  The input grid contains a variety of colors (red, maroon, yellow), while the output grid contains only two colors (white, gray). The spatial arrangement of pixels seems to matter, as does the original color. There appears to be a consolidation or simplification of colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (0-9)

actions:
  - type: transform_color
    input:
      - grid: input_grid
    output:
      - grid: output_grid
    parameters:
      - color_mapping:  # Implicit, to be determined

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - type: color_correspondence
    description:  Each input color likely maps to a specific output color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Replace** all pixels with the value 2 (red) or 9 (maroon) with value 0 (white).
3. **Replace** all the pixels with the value 4(yellow) with the value 5(grey).
4.  **Output** the transformed 3x3 grid.

In simpler term: The rule consolidate colors. If the pixel is red or maroon, it becomes white. If it is yellow, it becomes gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
