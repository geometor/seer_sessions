            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited observation, focusing only on color transformations for red, maroon, and yellow. The tests reveal inconsistencies. Some expected color changes didn't happen (Example 2), and some color mappings were only partially correct (Examples 3, 4), indicating that the rules for changing colors were applied incompletely or incorrectly. The results show that the transformation rule isn't consistently applied across all examples, suggesting a need for a more comprehensive rule that accounts for all colors present in the expected outputs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine all examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to identify *all* color transformations.\n2.  **Identify the correct mapping:** Determine the precise mapping of input colors to output colors, paying attention to all colors present in the outputs.\n3.  **Update the natural language program:** Clearly describe the complete set of color transformations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI need to understand how the colors changed (or didn't) in the supplied examples, and compare the input with the expected output and the results from the transformation function.\n\nHere's a summary, incorporating the previous results directly for comparison and additional clarity:\n\n| Example | Input Colors        | Expected Output Colors | Transformed Output Colors | Notes                                                                       |\n| :------ | :------------------ | :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 4, 2, 3             | 5, 0                   | 5, 3, 0                     | Yellow (4) to Gray (5) correct; Red (2) to White (0) correct; Green(3) not changed          |\n| 2       | 7, 3, 6             | 0, 5                   | 7,3,6                | all colors incorrect      |\n| 3       | 2, 9, 4             | 0, 5                   | 0,5,0                  | Red (2) and Maroon (9) to White (0) correct, partially; Yellow (4) to Gray (5) correct |\n| 4       | 2, 4, 1             | 0, 5,                 | 0, 5, 1               | Red (2) to White (0) correct, partially; Blue(1) not changed,                     |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: grid\n    properties:\n      - colors: [unique colors present across all input grids]\n      - dimensions: [height, width] # Can vary, but consistent within each example\n    actions:\n      - type: color_transformation\n        details: |\n          Input color is mapped to a specific output color.\n          7 -> 0\n          3 -> 0\n          6 -> 5\n          2 -> 0\n          9 -> 0\n          4 -> 5\n          1 -> 5\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule performs a color mapping on the input grid to produce the output grid. The following color transformations are applied:\n\n1.  Orange (7) becomes White (0).\n2.  Green (3) becomes White (0).\n3.  Gray (6) becomes Gray (5). This is effectively almost no change since both\n    grays are nearly identical.\n4.  Red (2) becomes White (0).\n5.  Maroon (9) becomes White (0).\n6.  Yellow (4) becomes Gray (5).\n7.  Blue (1) becomes light blue(8).\n\nEssentially, the color changes consolidate several related colors into color\nthat is similar, and makes many of the colors white.\n"
