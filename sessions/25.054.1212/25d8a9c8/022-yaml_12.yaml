      properties:
        - "Colors represent integers 0-9."
        - "Each grid is 3x3."
    - description: "Output grid of pixels, primarily gray (5) and black (0)."
      properties:
        - "Gray pixels seem to correspond to a 'background'."
        - "Black pixels correspond to a selected color in the input."

  - rules:
      - "Identify the most frequent color(s) in the input grid. If there is a tie between most frequent colors, all of those colors are set to black/zero."
      - "Change all other colors (those not among the most frequent) to gray (5)."
