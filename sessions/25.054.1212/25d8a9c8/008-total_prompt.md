## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 3 3
6 6 6
3 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47FBB490>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A62B30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors in the input grid are diverse (orange, green, magenta), while the output grid consists of only two colors (white and gray). The spatial arrangement is maintained (3x3 grid), but the color of specific cells changes. It appears that the center row's colors are changed to gray, while the rest is white.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  example_values: [7, 3, 6]
output:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  example_values: [0, 5]
transformation:
  type: color_change
  rule:
    -  if row == 1: # center row
        set value: 5
    - else:
         set value: 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  Check if the cell location corresponds to the **middle row (row index 1).**
3.  If the current cell belong to the **middle row**, it's color value to **5 (gray)**.
4.  **Otherwise,** set the value of the rest of the pixel in the grid to **0 (white)**.
5.  The resulting grid maintains the original 3x3 structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
