The input grid has colors in each cell, represented by single-digit integers.  The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some colors changed. The bottom row seems to be of particular significance, as all elements change from input to output based on properties of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
