objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: Copy elements from input_grid to output_grid.
  - name: shift_diagonal
    description: Position replicated elements diagonally down and to the right.

relationships:
  - input_grid elements are replicated and shifted diagonally in output_grid.
  - Non-zero elements in input_grid dictate the pattern in output_grid.
  - output_grid is twice the dimensions of input_grid
