summary: Expand a 3x3 grid to 6x6, propagating non-zero input pixels diagonally.
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers
    properties:
      size_input: 3x3
      size_output: 6x6
      expansion_factor: 2
      cells:
        description: individual pixels within the grid
        properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color: mapped from value (0=white, 1=blue, etc.)
          position: (row, column)
actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero
    description: Locate pixels in the input grid with values other than 0.
  - name: diagonal_expansion
    description: For each non-zero pixel, propagate its value diagonally down and to the right in the output grid.
    parameters:
      start_position: Original (row, column) of the non-zero pixel in the input, scaled for output.
      value: value of pixel
