## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 4 0
0 8 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4757E8C0>

**output:**
```
0 4 0 0 0 0
0 8 4 0 0 0
2 0 8 4 0 0
0 2 0 8 4 0
0 0 2 0 8 4
0 0 0 2 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC4757C4F0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid with single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x6 grid, appearing to be an expansion of the input grid. The input grid's elements seem to be replicated and shifted diagonally.
*   **Colors:** The colors from the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
*   **Empty Cells:** '0' (white) seems to represent empty or background cells.
*   **Pattern:** There's a clear diagonal replication of the input grid's non-zero elements.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: cell
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: Copy elements from input_grid to output_grid.
  - name: shift_diagonal
    description: Position replicated elements diagonally down and to the right.

relationships:
  - input_grid elements are replicated and shifted diagonally in output_grid.
  - Non-zero elements in input_grid dictate the pattern in output_grid.
  - output_grid is twice the dimensions of input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the size of the input grid (6x6 for a 3x3 input).
2.  **Iteration:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the cell's value is not 0, perform the copy.
    *   Copy the value to output\_grid\[row\]\[col\].
    *   Copy the value to output\_grid\[row+1\]\[col+1\].
    *   Copy the value to output\_grid\[row+2\]\[col+2\].
    *   Copy the value to output\_grid\[row+3\]\[col+3\].
3.  **Completion:** The output grid now contains the transformed data, with the diagonal replication pattern.

In short, it is replicating a diagonal line starting from original location and moving to the lower right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
