The grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The input grid appears to have multiple colored regions, while the output grid seems to be a highly simplified representation, possibly focusing on specific colors or shapes from the input. There seems to be a reduction or summarization process occurring. The reduction in size is significant. The relative positions are maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
