Previous Code:
```python
# Hypothetical analysis function - demonstration only
def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    results = {}
    results['pixels_off'] = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    results['size_correct'] = expected_output.shape == transformed_output.shape
    results['color_palette_correct'] = set(np.unique(transformed_output)).issubset(set(np.unique(expected_output)))

    expected_counts = {}
    for color in np.unique(expected_output):
        expected_counts[color] = np.sum(expected_output == color)
    transformed_counts = {}
    for color in np.unique(transformed_output):
        transformed_counts[color] = np.sum(transformed_output == color)
    results['correct_pixel_counts'] = expected_counts == transformed_counts

    return results
```

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

Input:
```
None
```
Expected Output:
```
None
```
match: None
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None
color_palette_correct: None
correct_pixel_counts: None
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, formatted as requested:

**General Assessment:**

The initial state is a blank slate.  We have a placeholder analysis function (`analyze_results`), but no actual transformation code yet, represented by `None`.  Since the first example pair is also `None`, the results are meaningless. The real work begins now, as we analyze concrete input-output examples to derive the transformation rule.  The strategy is to iteratively:

1.  **Observe:** Examine the input and output grids, noting objects, colors, positions, and spatial relationships.
2.  **Hypothesize:**  Formulate a natural language description of the transformation.
3.  **Encode:**  Translate the description into a Python function.
4.  **Test:**  Apply the function to the training inputs and compare the results to the expected outputs using `analyze_results`.
5.  **Refine:** Based on the analysis, adjust the hypothesis and code, repeating until the transformation is accurate for all training examples.

Since there is no meaningful input, output, match, or metric data, it's impossible to make any specific observations or suggest improvements on this data alone. The core strategy is sound, but needs input/output data to be actionable. Since there is no data, my goal is to create a structure YAML report, and Natural Language Program that will give the future me the correct context when moving to a real example.

**Metrics Gathering (using code_execution - hypothetical):**

Since there's no actual input/output data at the "None" stage, I can't execute code to gather metrics. All values will be `None`.

**YAML Block (Documenting Facts):**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    objects: []
    properties: {}
    grid_size: None
  output:
    objects: []
    properties: {}
    grid_size: None
  transformation:
    actions: []
    rules: []
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Because there are no examples, I cannot infer any transformation, so I will document this for the future me.

1.  **No Operation (Placeholder):** If the input is `None`, the output is `None`. This is a placeholder and will be replaced by the actual transformation rule as soon as we have examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
