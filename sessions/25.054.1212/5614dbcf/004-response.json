We have a placeholder analysis function (`analyze_results`), but no actual transformation code yet, represented by `None`.  Since the first example pair is also `None`, the results are meaningless. The real work begins now, as we analyze concrete input-output examples to derive the transformation rule.  The strategy is to iteratively:\n\n1.  **Observe:** Examine the input and output grids, noting objects, colors, positions, and spatial relationships.\n2.  **Hypothesize:**  Formulate a natural language description of the transformation.\n3.  **Encode:**  Translate the description into a Python function.\n4.  **Test:**  Apply the function to the training inputs and compare the results to the expected outputs using `analyze_results`.\n5.  **Refine:** Based on the analysis, adjust the hypothesis and code, repeating until the transformation is accurate for all training examples.\n\nSince there is no meaningful input, output, match, or metric data, it's impossible to make any specific observations or suggest improvements on this data alone. The core strategy is sound, but needs input/output data to be actionable. Since there is no data, my goal is to create a structure YAML report, and Natural Language Program that will give the future me the correct context when moving to a real example.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code_execution - hypothetical):**\n\nSince there's no actual input/output data at the \"None\" stage, I can't execute code to gather metrics. All values will be `None`.\n\n**YAML Block (Documenting Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    objects: []\n    properties: {}\n    grid_size: None\n  output:\n    objects: []\n    properties: {}\n    grid_size: None\n  transformation:\n    actions: []\n    rules: []\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nBecause there are no examples, I cannot infer any transformation, so I will document this for the future me.\n\n1.  **No Operation (Placeholder):** If the input is `None`, the output is `None`. This is a placeholder and will be replaced by the actual transformation rule as soon as we have examples.\n"
