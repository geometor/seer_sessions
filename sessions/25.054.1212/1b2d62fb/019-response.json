The colors present in this specific example are white (0), maroon (9), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on the azure (8) pixels. The output is significantly smaller.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, it's in the 4th column.\n2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** create an empty output with the same number of rows as the input\n    grid, and three columns\n3.  **Transfer:** Copy the column containing the azure (8) pixels.\n4.  copy to the left and right adjacent columns of the output pixels that are azure(8)\nin the copied column.\n5. all other cells are 0\n\nIn essence, the program extracts a 3x5 section of the input grid, centered on the vertical line of 8's in the middle. The output grid is a new grid, and it has values copied from the original. The azure pixels in the central line of the input and their intersecting horizontal neighbors of azure are extracted, and any blanks or other colors are turned to white.\n"
