## Example 3

**input:**
```
9 0 0 1 9 0 9
9 0 0 1 0 9 0
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 0 9 9
0 0 9 1 0 9 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC47FBBFD0>

**output:**
```
0 8 0
0 0 8
0 8 8
8 0 0
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC443EDDB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 5x7 grid of single-digit integers (colors). Dominant colors are maroon (9), white (0), and blue (1).  The blue (1) forms a vertical line in the center.
*   **Output Grid:** A 5x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It contains only white (0) and azure (8). The azure forms a pattern that resembles a distorted or mirrored version of the blue vertical line in the input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve a reduction in size (both width and height) and a change in color. The central blue line in the input seems to be the key element that's being transformed into the azure pattern in the output. It looks like the transformation removes surrounding maroon and white and replaces blue with azure.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x7
    elements: [0, 1, 9]
    description: Contains a vertical line of color 1 (blue).

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: [0, 8]
    description: Appears to be a compressed and recolored representation of the central line in the input_grid.

  - object: central_line
    type: line
    color: 1 (blue)
    location: input_grid, column 4
    description: Vertical line of blue pixels. This seems the focus of the transformation

  - action: compression
    description: The grid is reduced in width and height.

  - action: recoloring
    description: Color 1 (blue) in the input is replaced by color 8 (azure) in the output.

  - action: extraction
    description: Only a specific object is transformed, other pixels that aren't part of it are eliminated

  - relationship:
      object1: central_line
      object2: output_grid
      relation: transforms_to
      description: The blue line in the input grid is transformed into the azure pattern in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. It's in the center (column 4).
2. **Extract:** extract the column where all the values are equal to one
3.  **Resize/Compress:** Reduce the width of the extracted column to three. Place the column in the center
4.  **Recolor:** Change all blue (1) pixels in the extracted area to azure (8).
5.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in output with the color white (0).

Essentially, the program isolates the central blue line, changes its color to azure, and presents it on a smaller, all-white background. The surrounding pixels in the original image are discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
