## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 9
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 0 1 9 9 9
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC44391A80>

**output:**
```
0 8 8
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC44392320>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another, smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a vertical blue stripe (color 1) and a significant amount of maroon (color 9), and white (color 0). The output grid seems to be a condensed version, primarily white, with a couple of azure pixels (color 8). The positions of the non-white pixels in the output seem to relate to the position of the blue stripe in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 9] # white, blue, maroon
      - dimensions: [5, 7] # 5 rows, 7 columns
      - pattern: vertical blue stripe (color 1) at column index 3

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 8] # white, azure
      - dimensions: [5, 3] # 5 rows, 3 columns
      - pattern:  azure pixels (color 8) at row 0, columns 1 and 2

  - relationship: size_reduction
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    properties:
      - horizontal_reduction: "columns reduced from 7 to 3"
      - column_mapping: "output columns correspond to regions in the input"
      - color_mapping: "blue (1) in input seems to become azure (8) in output; white(0) stays as white(0),maroon(9) gets removed, and azure(8) replaces blue(1)"

  - action: transformation
    description: "The input grid is transformed into the output grid."
    steps:
      - "Select columns from input grid based on a yet-to-be-determined rule."
      - "Map colors: input color 1 becomes output color 8, 0 stays 0, 9 is removed."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Column:** Locate the column index of the vertical blue stripe (color 1) in the input grid. In this example, it's column 3 (starting the count from 0).
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same number of rows as the input grid, but with only 3 columns.
3.  **Populate First Column:** Fill the entire first column of the output grid with white (color 0).
4.  **Populate Second Column:** Create a new column by taking, at index = (blue strip index // 2) of original grid. Fill this column's content with color azure (8) at the row index where blue appears, 0 otherwise
5.  **Populate Third Column**: Create a new column by taking, at index = (blue strip index // 2) of original grid. Fill this column's content with color azure (8) at the row index where blue appears, 0 otherwise.
6.  The output has width of 3, with two colored '8' next to each other in the top row. And all others are 0.

In simpler terms, a column to the left, in the middle, and to the right of the dividing line (blue stripe index // 2) are taken, and the value is converted to '8' where '1' appears in the input, 0 otherwise.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
