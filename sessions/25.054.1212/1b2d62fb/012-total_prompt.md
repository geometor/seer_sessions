Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding, focusing solely on a vertical blue stripe and its immediate surrounding. It correctly identifies the blue stripe but fails to accurately map the surrounding pixels and apply the correct color transformations. The main issue is that the code *always* outputs two columns of azure next to a single column of 0, and bases those azure pixels at locations where blue was found in *any* of the blue stripe's columns. The expectation, however, seems to be more nuanced. It looks like the output should be a three-pixel wide window centered on the blue stripe, and the azure color should *replace* the blue, not appear where any blue was found in the original blue stripe column.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Stripe Identification:** The current `find_blue_stripe_column` function only returns the *first* column where *any* blue pixel is present. However, we should be looking for the column index of the blue stripe itself, and use that index to correctly position our window.
2.  **Precise Windowing:** Instead of assuming two azure columns, implement a three-column window centered on the blue stripe, taking pixels from one column to the left, the center, and one column to the right of the identified stripe, wrapping around if needed.
3. **Correct Color Mapping**: only the blue pixels in the blue stripe's column should be mapped to azure in our window.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
Here are observations based on provided outputs, and code execution to extract some other metrics.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Blue Stripe:** Locate the vertical column in the input grid that contains only blue (color 1) pixels. This is the "blue stripe". Record the column index of this stripe.
2. **Create a Window**: Create an output grid that is 3 columns wide and has the same number of rows as the input.
3. **Center on Stripe:** Populate the output grid with a three-pixel wide "window" centered on the identified blue stripe.
4. **Map colors:**
    *   If the blue stripe is not at the edge, copy pixels to the output grid one column to the left of the blue stripe, the blue stripe's column, and the one to the right.
        *   If a pixel in the selected column is blue, it should be set to azure (8).
        *   All other pixel values should map to 0.
    * If the blue stripe is on the very left edge (column 0), take the rightmost column as the "left" column.
    *   If the blue stripe is on the very right edge (column width -1), take the leftmost column as the right column of the window.
5.  **All other pixels:** If there isn't a blue stripe, the output is all zeros.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
