The primary colors involved seem to be maroon (9), white(0), and azure (8). The azure (8) pixels appear to be the most significant, acting as a kind of marker or selector. The output grid seems to be a cropped and filtered version of the input, retaining only certain elements based on the position of the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is the fourth column from the left (index 3, zero based).\n\n2.  **Determine Output Columns:** Include the selector column as the second column of the output, and select one row from the immediate left of the selected column.\n\n3.  **Crop Input:** Consider a sub-grid from the input, which start at the second row and ends at the second to last row.\n\n4.  **Filter Pixels:** Within the cropped grid, keep all cells which are colored in white (0), and copy only the azure(8) pixels from selected columns.\n5. Copy this subgrid into the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates and extracts the azure column, takes a column that is horizontal offset of -1 relative to the azure column, then copies into a smaller grid the white and azure pixels.\n"
