            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 5x7 grid of single-digit integers (colors). Dominant colors are maroon (9), white (0), and blue (1).  The blue (1) forms a vertical line in the center.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 5x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It contains only white (0) and azure (8). The azure forms a pattern that resembles a distorted or mirrored version of the blue vertical line in the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve a reduction in size (both width and height) and a change in color. The central blue line in the input seems to be the key element that's being transformed into the azure pattern in the output. It looks like the transformation removes surrounding maroon and white and replaces blue with azure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It's in the center (column 4).\n2. **Extract:** extract the column where all the values are equal to one\n3.  **Resize/Compress:** Reduce the width of the extracted column to three. Place the column in the center\n4.  **Recolor:** Change all blue (1) pixels in the extracted area to azure (8).\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in output with the color white (0).\n\nEssentially, the program isolates the central blue line, changes its color to azure, and presents it on a smaller, all-white background.
