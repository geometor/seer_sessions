Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of different dimensions. The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid seems to contain a vertical line of blue (1) pixels surrounded by other colors. The output grid is smaller and appears to extract a portion of the input, replacing the blue with azure.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 5x7
        output: 5x3
      elements: pixels
      colors:
        input: [0, 9, 1]
        output: [0, 8]

  - type: line
    properties:
      orientation: vertical
      color:
        input: 1 (blue)
        output: 8 (azure)
      position:
        input: column 4
        output: columns 2&3

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A section of the input grid is extracted.
  - type: color_substitution
    description: Blue (1) is replaced with azure (8).
  - type: size_reduction
    description: change grid dimensions

relationships:
  - input_grid contains vertical_line
  - output_grid is_a_subset_of input_grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** a 5x3 section of the input grid. The section contains only white and the two azure cells.
3.  **Locate** where the vertical blue line would be, at the center.
4.  **Substitute**: Create two azure cells side by side where the center of the blue vertical line was.
5. **Return** the final 5x3 grid
