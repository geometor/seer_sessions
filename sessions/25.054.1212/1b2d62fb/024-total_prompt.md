1.  **Find the Central Column:** Scan the input grid to find a column where *all* pixels are azure (8). This is the "central column." If no such column is found, return an all white grid that matches the dimensions of the input grid.

3.  **Copy Central Column:** If the central column was found, copy the entire central column from the input grid to the second (middle) column of the output grid.
4.  **Copy Adjacent Azure Pixels:** Iterate through all rows of the input grid:
      *   If the found "central column" is not at index 0, check the pixel to the *left* of the central column in the input grid. If it's azure (8), copy it to the corresponding position in the *first* column of the output grid.
      *    If the found "central column" is not at the last index, check the pixel to the *right* of the central column in the input grid. If it's azure (8), copy it to the corresponding position in the *third* column of the output grid.
5. **Return Output Grid** return the output grid.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. It correctly identified the core idea of finding a vertical azure line and creating a 3-column output. However, it failed to accurately capture the rule for copying adjacent azure pixels. The current code *always* copies the central column, and *always* copies the left/right adjacents if they are azure and the central column isn't on the edge, resulting in the output always having a center column of azure. The examples show that this adjacent copy is conditional and sometimes involves the *absence* of an adjacent azure pixel, not just its presence. Also, it seems it should only copy at most one azure pixel to the left and one to the right, not the entire column. It looks like if there is an azure pixel horizontally adjacent to the vertical line, then the adjacent one should be a '0' (white).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Adjacent Pixel Logic:** The core issue is the flawed logic concerning which adjacent pixels get copied. We need to revise the rules to accurately reflect the conditions under which an adjacent azure pixel is copied (or not copied).  The "copy if azure and not at edge" logic is clearly wrong based on the provided test feedback.
2.  **Examine All Examples:** Instead of deriving the rule solely from the first example, the updated natural language program must account for *all* provided input/output pairs. It seems like it should only copy one cell to the left, and one to the right.
3.  **Consider "Blank" Spaces:** The expected outputs often have white (0) pixels in the first or third columns. We need to understand the conditions that dictate when these spaces remain blank versus when an azure pixel is copied. It looks like the presence of a blank (0) in the input might be important.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the adjacency rule violations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has a central azure column at index 3.
    *   Output should have all 0s except for row 3: `0 8 0`
    *   Code incorrectly copies the central column to all rows.
    *   Key Observation: Only the row where adjacent pixels are *not* all azure has an azure pixel in output column 2.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has a central azure column at index 3.
    *   Output should have all 0s except for row 0: `0 8 0`.
    *    Code incorrectly copies the central column to all rows.
    *   Key Observation: Only the row where adjacent pixels are *not* all azure has an azure pixel in output column 2.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has a central azure column at index 3.
    *   Output varies across rows: `0 8 0`, `0 0 8`, `0 8 8`, `8 0 0`, `8 0 0`.
    *   Code incorrectly copies the central column to all rows.
    *    Key Observation:
        * Row 0 has an azure in output col 2 (center) because of the central azure. It has a 0 in output col 1 because there's a 0 to the left of center. It has a 0 on the right because there's a 9.
        * Row 1 has an azure in output col 3 because the central azure column has an adjacent 0 to its right.
        * Row 2 has azure pixels in col 2 (central) and col 3. The left adjacent is 0, and the right has no adjacent.
        * Row 3: copies left, but not right or center.
        * Row 4: copies left.

*   **Example 4:**  Similar pattern to Example 3.

*   **Example 5:**  Similar pattern to previous.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Central Azure Column:** Scan the input grid to locate a column where *all* pixels are azure (8). This is the "central column."
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new output grid with the same number of rows as the input, and exactly 3 columns. Initialize all cells in the output grid to white (0).
3.  **Conditional Copying:** For each row:
    *   If the central azure column exists, and in this row, there is *not* an azure pixel immediately to the *left* of the central column in the *input grid*, copy the azure (8) from the central column of the input to the second column of the output for this row.
    *   If the central azure column exists *and* in this row, *and* if there isn't an azure immediately to the *right* of the central column, copy that azure (8) to the *third* column of the output for that row.
    *    If the central azure column exists *and* there is no azure pixel immediately to the left of the central column, *and* if it is not at the extreme left (index > 0), copy the value from the input pixel immediately to the left, to column 1 of the output row.
    *    If there is *not* a vertical azure line found, return a grid of zeros with the same dimensions as the *input* grid.

This revised natural language program tries to incorporate the crucial conditional adjacency rules observed in the examples. It emphasizes checking for the *absence* of azure in adjacent positions to determine the copying logic.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
