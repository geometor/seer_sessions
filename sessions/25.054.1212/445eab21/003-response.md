Okay, here's an assessment of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to find a bounding box around a specific color (azure, 8) and extract that region. This worked for the first example where the target object was azure. However, it failed for the subsequent examples because:

1.  **Incorrect Target Color:** The code is hardcoded to look for azure (8), while the target object changes color in each example (azure in the first, orange in the second, and yellow in the third).
2.  **Empty Output:** When no object of color is present the transform returns \[\[]].
3.  **Assumes the output is the bounding box:** it appears that the output object
    is a 2x2 block of the input color.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Target Color Detection:** Instead of hardcoding the target color, we need to dynamically determine it. A good approach is to find the color that forms a "solid" 2x2 square in the input.
2.  **Handle Empty return:** replace the empty \[\[]] return with something more
    useful, like an error or do not return an output at all.
3. **output 2x2 shape:** Instead of returning the entire bounding box of the
    found object, we must create a new object that is a 2x2 solid of the correct
    color.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x10
    *   Expected Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Observed Output Shape: 5x5
    *   Target Color: Azure (8)
    *   Result: Incorrect. The code extracted a 5x5 bounding box instead of a 2x2 block.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x10
    *   Expected Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Observed Output Shape: Empty array
    *   Target Color: Orange (7)
    *   Result: Incorrect. The code found no azure, so returned an empty grid.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x10
    *   Expected Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Observed Output Shape: Empty Array
    *   Target Color: Yellow (4)
    *   Result: Incorrect. The code found no azure, so returned an empty grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_object:
      shape: 10x10
      target_color: 8
      target_description: "A 5x5 region of azure (8) pixels."
    output_object:
        shape: 2x2
        color: 8
        description: "2x2 block of the input color"
    action: "Create 2x2 solid block of the target color from the input."

  - example_id: 2
    input_object:
      shape: 10x10
      target_color: 7
      target_description: "A region of orange pixels."
    output_object:
      shape: 2x2
      color: 7
      description: "2x2 block of the input color"
    action: "Create 2x2 solid block of the target color from the input."
  - example_id: 3
    input_object:
        shape: 10x10
        target_color: 4
        target_description: "A region of yellow pixels"
    output_object:
        shape: 2x2
        color: 4
        description: "2x2 block of the input color"
    action: "Create 2x2 solid block of the target color from the input."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Examine the input grid and determine color that
    makes up the output 2x2.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 2x2 grid.
3.  **Fill the grid with solid target color:** All cells of the grid must be
    filled with the color found in step 1.
4. Return the new grid.
