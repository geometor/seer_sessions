One is a larger \"C\" shape composed of yellow (4) pixels, and the other is a smaller square shape in the bottom right made of red (2) pixels. The background is white (0). The output is a 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels. It appears the transformation extracts a specific feature, the topmost and leftmost instance of yellow color, and forms a square of the minimum size.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
