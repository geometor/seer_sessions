The input grid appears to have a large area of a single color (blue, represented by '1') and a smaller, internal region of different colors (gray '5' and magenta '6'). The output grid consists only of the colors from this internal region, excluding the surrounding blue pixels. The output grid retains the spatial arrangement of the internal colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
