Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Start:** Find the top-left most non-blue pixel in the input grid. This is the starting point (row, col) for the output.
2.  **Determine output dimensions:**
    *    Start from the first non-blue pixel.
    *    Expand down, including rows, until a row of all blue is encountered.
    *   Expand right, including columns, until a column of all blue is encountered.
3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create an output grid using the dimensions determined. Copy the corresponding non-blue pixels from the input grid to the output grid, starting from the identified top-left non-blue pixel. Stop adding from a row or column if blue (1) pixels encountered.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
