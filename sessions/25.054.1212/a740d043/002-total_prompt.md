## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 1 1 1 1
1 2 2 3 1 1 1
1 1 1 2 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC475859C0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
2 2 3
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47587430>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains numerical values representing different colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, white=0). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colors and their spatial relationships within the input. The output grid includes zeros, suggesting some elements are filtered out.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 3] # Representing colors

actions:
  - type: filter
    description: Select specific elements from the input grid.
  - type: condense
    description: Reduce the dimensions of the grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: Many-to-one mapping, filtering, and condensing.
  - color_values: input contains colors 1,2,3, output contains color 2,3,0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Blue Elements:** Focus on the non-blue (non-1) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** From the top-left corner of the first identified non-blue pixel (reading row first) extract non-blue pixels to a 3 x 3 output grid.
3.  **Handle edges:** If there are not enough pixels to fill a row or column use 0s.

In summary, the input grid has non-blue values consolidated to the top-left, and empty values are filled with white(0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
