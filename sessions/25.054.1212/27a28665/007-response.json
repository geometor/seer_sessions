The output is a single number, 2, on what would be a red (2) background. The number in the output seems to correspond somehow to the input grid, but not in a simple way related to counting every cell, or even every azure, white, or background cell (which do not appear in output). I suspect counting is involved, possibly involving specific arrangements of cells.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Count the number of instances of \"azure\" colored pixels which form a 2x2 box filled with only azure.\n4.
