## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47578730>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC4757A950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid (input) and a single number (output). The grid contains two colors: gray (5) and white (0).  The output appears to be related to the count of a specific color or pattern within the input grid. The color mapping I was given earlier is critical here.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 5
        color: gray
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (1,1)]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
  - type: scalar
    value: 2
    color: red

relationships:
  - type: count
    object1: grid
    property: number of distinct objects of 'white'

actions:
  - type: count_distinct
    input: grid
    output: scalar
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input is a 3x3 grid. Each contiguous block of the same color is one distinct object.
2.  **Count Distinct White Objects:** Count the number of distinct white (0) objects.
3.  **Output:** The output is the count of the distinct white objects. The output will always use color red.

In the example provided, imagine the 'white' color is like drawing lines/shapes without lifting your pen.  You have to draw 2 separate lines.  A single line (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) or an isolated dot counts as 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
