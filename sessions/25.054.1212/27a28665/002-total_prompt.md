## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475862F0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC47586DA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values (0 and 5). These values appear to represent colors, specifically gray (5) and white (0). The output is a single numerical value (1), which, based on context, appears to be blue. It appears that counting is involved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input is a 3x3 grid.
    elements:
      - value: 5
        color: gray
        positions: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [(0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)]
  - type: scalar
    description: Output is a single value.
    value: 1
    color: blue

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Count the number of distinct colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0).
2.  The output is a 1x1 grid with the value representing the number of non-white colors.

Alternative, and simpler, program.

1. Count the number of colors in the input, not including 0 (white)
2. the output it a single pixel, representing the result of the count.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
