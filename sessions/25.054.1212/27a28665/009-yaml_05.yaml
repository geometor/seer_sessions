observations:
  - task: Count non-overlapping 2x2 squares in the input grid.
  - input:
      type: 2D grid
      dimensions: Variable (between 1x1 and 30x30)
      elements: Integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - output:
      type: 2D grid
      dimensions: 1x1
      elements: Integer (count of 2x2 squares)
  - objects:
      - name: 2x2 square
        description: A contiguous block of 2x2 pixels of the same color.
  - actions:
      - name: count_squares
        description: Count the number of non-overlapping 2x2 squares in the input grid.
  - constraints:
      output_grid_size: "The output is always a 1x1 grid."
