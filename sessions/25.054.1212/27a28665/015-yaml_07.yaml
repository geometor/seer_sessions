observations:
  - task_id: 014
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size: 1x1
  - object_definition: Contiguous regions of the same color, including diagonals.
  - primary_color: white (0)
  - action: Count distinct objects.
  - output_format: A 1x1 grid containing the count of distinct white objects.
  - error_type: Incorrect object counting due to missing diagonal adjacency.
