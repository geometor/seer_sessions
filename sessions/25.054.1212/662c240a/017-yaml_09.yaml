observations:
  - task_id: 016
  - general:
    - The input and output grids always have the same width.
    - The output grid is always a sub-region (contiguous rows) of the input grid.
    - The output grid's rows are always in the same order as they appear in the input grid.
    -  The height of output grid is always less than or equal to input
  - example_1:
    - result: "success"
    - output_block_location: bottom
    - output_block_context: "different colors above"
  - example_2:
    - result: "failure"
    - output_block_location: "middle"
    - output_block_context: "different colors above and below"
  - example_3:
    - result: "success"
    - output_block_location: bottom
    - output_block_context: "different colors above"
  - example_4:
    - result: "failure"
    - output_block_location: top
    - output_block_context: "different colors below"
  - block_selection:
      - description: The output block appears to be the topmost block of rows that, when compared to the block *below*, exhibits a complete difference in colors across all columns in adjacent rows.
