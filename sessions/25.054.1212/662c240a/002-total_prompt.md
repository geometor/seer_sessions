## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 9 8
9 8 8
8 8 8
2 2 1
2 2 1
1 1 2
4 4 4
4 4 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7BFC4757DAB0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47579630>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain multiple colored regions, while the output grid seems to represent a specific section of the input grid. The colors and their spatial arrangement are crucial. In this specific example, the output grid corresponds to the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x3
      - colors: [8, 9, 2, 1, 4, 3] # azure, maroon, red, blue, yellow, green
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [4, 3] # yellow, green
  - relation: output_is_subgrid_of_input
    properties:
      - location: bottom-right
      - dimensions: 3x3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input grid's dimensions.
2.  Locate the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid within the input grid.
3.  Extract this 3x3 subgrid.
4.  The extracted subgrid is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
