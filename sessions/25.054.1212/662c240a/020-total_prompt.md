## Example 4

**input:**
```
8 8 4
4 4 4
4 4 8
1 1 3
1 3 3
3 3 1
6 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7BFC4890AE00>

**output:**
```
8 8 4
4 4 4
4 4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890AC50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are composed of square cells, each filled with a single color. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to contain several 3x3 colored squares whereas the output seems to contain only the top portion of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 3] # input grid
      cells: [integer values 0-9, representing colors]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # output grid
      cells: [integer values 0-9, representing colors]

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A sub-grid (or portion) is selected from the input.

relationships:
  - type: sub-grid
    description: The output grid is a direct copy of the top 3x3 portion of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input:** We are given a 9x3 grid (input).
2.  **Locate Sub-grid:** The output is formed from the very first sub-grid with dimensions 3x3. Consider the subgrid in the upper-left corner.
3. **Extract Sub-grid:** The top 3x3 section of the original input is extracted without alterations.
4.  **Output:** The output is composed from this extracted area.

In simpler terms, the output is a direct copy of the upper-left 3x3 portion (the top three rows) of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
