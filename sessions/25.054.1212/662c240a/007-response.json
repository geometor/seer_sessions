The input grid appears to be larger (9x3) than the output grid (3x3). The output grid seems to be a specific section extracted from the input grid. The colors (digits) present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid. Specifically, I can observe that color green (3) and magenta (6) are preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
