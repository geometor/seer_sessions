## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 5 5
5 1 1
5 1 1
3 3 3
3 6 3
3 6 6
7 7 7
7 2 2
7 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7BFC4757DAB0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
3 6 3
3 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4757EF20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) to another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger (9x3) than the output grid (3x3). The output grid seems to be a specific section extracted from the input grid. The colors (digits) present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid. Specifically, I can observe that color green (3) and magenta (6) are preserved.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 9x3
    colors: [1, 5, 3, 6, 7, 2]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [3, 6]
  - type: object
    description: sub-grid
    relation: output is a sub-grid of input
  - type: location
    description: location of sub-grid
    coordinates: rows 4-6, columns 1-3 of input grid
  - type: colors
    description: preserved colors in output
    values: [3,6]
  - type: colors
    description: removed colors
    values: [1,2,5,7]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Sub-grid:** Locate the 3x3 sub-grid within the input grid starting at row 4 and extending to row 6, and spanning columns 1 to 3.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract this identified 3x3 sub-grid.
3.  **Output:** The extracted sub-grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation rule is to extract a specific 3x3 section from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
