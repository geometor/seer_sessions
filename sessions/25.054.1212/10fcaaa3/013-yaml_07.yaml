objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: input_rows x input_cols, output_rows x output_cols
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: integers (0-9)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:  # Represents color based on integer value
        0: white
        4: yellow
        8: azure
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to a larger output grid.
  - type: fill
    description: Some of the '0' (white) pixels in the input are replaced with '8' (azure) in the output. The filling creates the boarder and fills between objects
  - type: copy and repeat
    description: The input grid is repeated more than once, the pattern shows it twice

relationships:
  - input_grid: smaller than output_grid
  - yellow_pixels: maintain relative position in output.
  - azure_pixels: added in the expanded output, possibly related to the distance between other the color squares.
