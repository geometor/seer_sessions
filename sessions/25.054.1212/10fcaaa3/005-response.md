Okay, here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good start, focusing on mirroring non-zero, non-eight pixels and filling some of the background. However, it failed to generalize across all examples. The issues stem from:

1.  **Inconsistent Height Expansion:** The height expansion logic is a mix of doubling and adding a fixed value (2), making it specific to certain input dimensions. It needs to be unified.
2.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The mirroring logic is overly complex and contains separate `if` conditions for different input dimensions, making it brittle and hard to understand. It tries to handle pixel placement on a case-by-case basis rather than using a general formula.
3.  **Inconsistent Azure (8) Filling:** The background filling with azure (8) is also inconsistent, with different rules applied based on input dimensions. A pattern-based approach is needed.
4.  Overfitting to specific examples

**Strategy:**

1.  **Unified Expansion:** Determine a consistent height expansion rule that works for all examples. Observe patterns related to heights and find a rule to explain all.
2.  **Generalized Mirroring:** Simplify the mirroring logic to use a single, consistent formula based on the input and output dimensions. Eliminate special-case handling.
3.  **Pattern-Based Background Filling:** Identify the underlying pattern for azure (8) filling. It seems to be related to creating some sort of checkerboard or alternating pattern, possibly linked to the mirrored positions.
4. **Iterative Testing** test after each change

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting the specific issues:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 2x4
    *   Expected Output: 4x8
    *   Actual Output: 4x8, but pixel values are incorrect.
    *   Issues: Incorrect pixel placement, incorrect background filling.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x4
    *   Expected Output: 6x8
    *   Actual Output: 5x8, and pixel values are very incorrect
    *   Issues: Incorrect height, incorrect mirroring, incorrect background filling.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x3
    *   Expected Output: 10x6
    *   Actual Output: 10x6, but pixel values are incorrect.
    *   Issues: Incorrect mirroring, incorrect background filling.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 4x4
    *   Expected Output: 8x8
    *   Actual Output: 8x8, but pixel values are incorrect.
    *   Issues: Incorrect mirroring, incorrect background filling.

**YAML Facts:**
```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a mirroring effect, primarily for non-zero and non-eight colored pixels.
  - observation: |
      The width of the output grid is always double the width of the input grid.
  - observation: |
        The height expansion is related to the original height, either doubling or adding 2
  - observation: |
       The mirrored pixels create a symmetrical pattern relative to the center of the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Azure (8) and white (0) are used to fill the background, creating alternating patterns

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output width is always double the input width.
    *   If the original height is 3, the output height is the original height + 2. Otherwise the output height is double the input height.

2.  **Mirror Non-Background Pixels:**
    *   For each pixel in the input grid that is *not* 0 or 8:
        *   Calculate a base position in the output grid. If height is doubled: y * 2, x * 2. If height is original + 2: y, x * 2.
        *   Place the pixel at the base position.
        *   Calculate the mirrored position: `output_width - 1 - base_x`, `output_height-1-base_y if base_y*2 + 1 < output_height` else `base_y`.
        *    Place a copy of the pixel at the mirrored position.

3.  **Fill Background:**

    *   Fill the remaining empty cells (value 0) in the output grid using a checkerboard.
    *   If the output grid x position is even, fill the cell with 8 (azure). If x position is odd, the background pixel stays 0 (white).
