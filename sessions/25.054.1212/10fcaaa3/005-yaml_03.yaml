facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves a mirroring effect, primarily for non-zero and non-eight colored pixels.
  - observation: |
      The width of the output grid is always double the width of the input grid.
  - observation: |
        The height expansion is related to the original height, either doubling or adding 2
  - observation: |
       The mirrored pixels create a symmetrical pattern relative to the center of the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Azure (8) and white (0) are used to fill the background, creating alternating patterns
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        description: The original grid of pixels.
        properties:
          - height: Variable (2, 3, 5, or 4 in the examples).
          - width: Variable (4, 3, or 4 in the examples).
          - colors: Contains various colors (0-9).
      - name: output_grid
        description: The transformed grid of pixels.
        properties:
          - height: Variable, determined by a rule based on input height.
          - width: Double the input width.
          - colors: Contains the same colors as the input, plus additional background colors (0 and 8).
      - name: non_background_pixel
        description: Pixels in the original image that have colors other than 0 and 8.
        properties:
         - original_position: (x,y) in input grid
         - mirrored_position: calculated based on output dimensions and mirroring rule
      - name: background_pixel
        description: pixels that are set to either 0 or 8
        properties:
         - color: 0 (white) or 8 (azure)

  - actions:
      - name: Mirror
        description: Replicate non-background pixels in the output grid, creating a horizontally mirrored image
        details: each non-background pixel appears twice in the output grid, except where overwritten by another pixel
      - name: Expand
        description: Increase the height of the input, some cases it is doubled, in one case 2 is added.
      - name: FillBackground
        description: set background pixels to either 0 or 8
