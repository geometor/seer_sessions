            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good start, focusing on mirroring non-zero, non-eight pixels and filling some of the background. However, it failed to generalize across all examples. The issues stem from:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Height Expansion:** The height expansion logic is a mix of doubling and adding a fixed value (2), making it specific to certain input dimensions. It needs to be unified.\n2.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The mirroring logic is overly complex and contains separate `if` conditions for different input dimensions, making it brittle and hard to understand. It tries to handle pixel placement on a case-by-case basis rather than using a general formula.\n3.  **Inconsistent Azure (8) Filling:** The background filling with azure (8) is also inconsistent, with different rules applied based on input dimensions. A pattern-based approach is needed.\n4.  Overfitting to specific examples\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Unified Expansion:** Determine a consistent height expansion rule that works for all examples. Observe patterns related to heights and find a rule to explain all.\n2.  **Generalized Mirroring:** Simplify the mirroring logic to use a single, consistent formula based on the input and output dimensions. Eliminate special-case handling.\n3.  **Pattern-Based Background Filling:** Identify the underlying pattern for azure (8) filling. It seems to be related to creating some sort of checkerboard or alternating pattern, possibly linked to the mirrored positions.\n4. **Iterative Testing** test after each change\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting the specific issues:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 2x4\n    *   Expected Output: 4x8\n    *   Actual Output: 4x8, but pixel values are incorrect.\n    *   Issues: Incorrect pixel placement, incorrect background filling.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x4\n    *   Expected Output: 6x8\n    *   Actual Output: 5x8, and pixel values are very incorrect\n    *   Issues: Incorrect height, incorrect mirroring, incorrect background filling.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5x3\n    *   Expected Output: 10x6\n    *   Actual Output: 10x6, but pixel values are incorrect.\n    *   Issues: Incorrect mirroring, incorrect background filling.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 4x4\n    *   Expected Output: 8x8\n    *   Actual Output: 8x8, but pixel values are incorrect.\n    *   Issues: Incorrect mirroring, incorrect background filling.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The transformation involves a mirroring effect, primarily for non-zero and non-eight colored pixels.\n  - observation: |\n      The width of the output grid is always double the width of the input grid.\n  - observation: |\n        The height expansion is related to the original height, either doubling or adding 2\n  - observation: |\n       The mirrored pixels create a symmetrical pattern relative to the center of the output grid.\n  - observation: |\n      Azure (8) and white (0) are used to fill the background, creating alternating patterns\n  - objects:\n      - name: input_grid\n        description: The original grid of pixels.\n        properties:\n          - height: Variable (2, 3, 5, or 4 in the examples).\n          - width: Variable (4, 3, or 4 in the examples).\n          - colors: Contains various colors (0-9).\n      - name: output_grid\n        description: The transformed grid of pixels.\n        properties:\n          - height: Variable, determined by a rule based on input height.\n          - width: Double the input width.\n          - colors: Contains the same colors as the input, plus additional background colors (0 and 8).\n      - name: non_background_pixel\n        description: Pixels in the original image that have colors other than 0 and 8.\n        properties:\n         - original_position: (x,y) in input grid\n         - mirrored_position: calculated based on output dimensions and mirroring rule\n      - name: background_pixel\n        description: pixels that are set to either 0 or 8\n        properties:\n         - color: 0 (white) or 8 (azure)\n\n  - actions:\n      - name: Mirror\n        description: Replicate non-background pixels in the output grid, creating a horizontally mirrored image\n        details: each non-background pixel appears twice in the output grid, except where overwritten by another pixel\n      - name: Expand\n        description: Increase the height of the input, some cases it is doubled, in one case 2 is added.\n      - name: FillBackground\n        description: set background pixels to either 0 or 8\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The output width is always double the input width.\n    *   If the original height is 3, the output height is the original height + 2. Otherwise the output height is double the input height.\n\n2.  **Mirror Non-Background Pixels:**\n    *   For each pixel in the input grid that is *not* 0 or 8:\n        *   Calculate a base position in the output grid. If height is doubled: y * 2, x * 2. If height is original + 2: y, x * 2.\n        *   Place the pixel at the base position.\n        *   Calculate the mirrored position: `output_width - 1 - base_x`, `output_height-1-base_y if base_y*2 + 1 < output_height` else `base_y`.\n        *    Place a copy of the pixel at the mirrored position.\n\n3.  **Fill Background:**\n\n    *   Fill the remaining empty cells (value 0) in the output grid using a checkerboard.\n    *   If the output grid x position is even, fill the cell with 8 (azure). If x position is odd, the background pixel stays 0 (white).\n\n"
