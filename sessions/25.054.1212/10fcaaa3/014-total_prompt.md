## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 4 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC4890A380>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8
0 4 0 0 4 0
8 0 8 8 0 8
0 8 8 0 8 0
4 0 0 4 0 0
8 8 8 8 8 8
0 4 0 0 4 0
8 0 8 8 0 8
0 8 8 0 8 0
4 0 0 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x640 at 0x7BFC48908D00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another grid. The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. The input grid contains '0' (white) and '4' (yellow) pixels. The output grid includes '0' (white), '4' (yellow), and '8' (azure) pixels.  The yellow pixels seem to maintain their relative positions. The azure pixels seem to be filling in some of the white space.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: input_rows x input_cols, output_rows x output_cols
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: integers (0-9)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:  # Represents color based on integer value
        0: white
        4: yellow
        8: azure
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to a larger output grid.
  - type: fill
    description: Some of the '0' (white) pixels in the input are replaced with '8' (azure) in the output. The filling creates the boarder and fills between objects
  - type: copy and repeat
    description: The input grid is repeated more than once, the pattern shows it twice

relationships:
  - input_grid: smaller than output_grid
  - yellow_pixels: maintain relative position in output.
  - azure_pixels: added in the expanded output, possibly related to the distance between other the color squares.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded. The output grid is double and one more in width, with the input grid being doubled and then one is added. the height of the output is also doubled, then one added.

2. **Copy and Repetition:** the input is duplicated to a width two times the size of the original, and then the output is repeated, two times,

3.  **Border:** A border of 8's appears around the output.

4.  **Fill:** Around each yellow ('4') pixel in the expanded grid, fill the adjacent '0' (white) pixels with '8' (azure) in a checkerboard like pattern. Specifically, change some remaining '0' pixels to '8' to create the pattern seen. The 8's appear to fill in the spots and connect up to the yellow spots.

In summary, the transformation takes the input grid, repeats it, adds a border of 8's, and strategically fills certain '0' pixels with '8' around the original '4' pixels to produce the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
