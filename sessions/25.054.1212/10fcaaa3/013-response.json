The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. The input grid contains '0' (white) and '4' (yellow) pixels. The output grid includes '0' (white), '4' (yellow), and '8' (azure) pixels.  The yellow pixels seem to maintain their relative positions. The azure pixels seem to be filling in some of the white space.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The filling creates the boarder and fills between objects\n  - type: copy and repeat\n    description: The input grid is repeated more than once, the pattern shows it twice\n\nrelationships:\n  - input_grid: smaller than output_grid\n  - yellow_pixels: maintain relative position in output.\n  - azure_pixels: added in the expanded output, possibly related to the distance between other the color squares.\n\n```"

The output grid is double and one more in width, with the input grid being doubled and then one is added. the height of the output is also doubled, then one added.\n\n2. **Copy and Repetition:** the input is duplicated to a width two times the size of the original, and then the output is repeated, two times,\n\n3.  **Border:** A border of 8's appears around the output.\n\n4.  **Fill:** Around each yellow ('4') pixel in the expanded grid, fill the adjacent '0' (white) pixels with '8' (azure) in a checkerboard like pattern. Specifically, change some remaining '0' pixels to '8' to create the pattern seen. The 8's appear to fill in the spots and connect up to the yellow spots.\n\nIn summary, the transformation takes the input grid, repeats it, adds a border of 8's, and strategically fills certain '0' pixels with '8' around the original '4' pixels to produce the final output.\n"
