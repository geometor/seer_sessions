            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some key aspects of the transformation, but failed to correctly handle several critical details, especially concerning the placement and mirroring of the azure lines and the colored pixels. The core issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Vertical Azure Placement:** The azure lines are placed on *both* sides of colored columns, regardless of original grid position. It should only flank the copied pixels.\n2.  **Incorrect Horizontal Azure Placement**: The placement of the azure line separating the top and bottom halves is not consistent, it varies depending on the contents of the grid.\n3.  **Incorrect Vertical Mirroring:** The vertical mirroring is copying *every* pixel, when we want to copy pixels, but keep azure lines at fixed locations.\n4.  **Incorrect Copy and Mirror Horizontally**: The condition to copy and mirror horizontally only considers when it is not background, it also needs to exclude azure, or it will create extra azure lines.\n5. **Incorrect Vertical Highlight**: The condition to vertically highlight should only affect the top half of the new grid.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Azure Line Logic:**  Modify the code to correctly place the azure lines, flanking only copied colored pixels, in top half of the mirrored image.\n2.  **Precise Copying and Mirroring:** Ensure accurate horizontal mirroring of the colored pixels in the top half.\n3. **Precise Vertical Mirroring**: Ensure that the top half is correctly mirrored to the bottom half, and the azure line is consistent.\n4. **Fix Horizontal Line:** Place horizontal line consistently between top and bottom half of mirrored image.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nTo understand the errors, let's examine the pixel differences in more detail. The key metric here is `pixels_off`, and we focus on *why* those pixels are off. We already did this for previous iterations, so now we will summarize it here.\n\n*   **Example 1:** 19 pixels are off. The main problem is the placement of the azure highlight lines, and copying of the central colored pixel.\n*   **Example 2:** 28 pixels are off. The main problem is that the azure line is repeated multiple times and the content is not copied and mirrored correctly.\n*   **Example 3:** 36 pixels are off. Same problem as above, and the vertical mirroring is copying the whole image, not just the part above the azure line.\n*   **Example 4:** 35 pixels are off. Same problems as above.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - dimensions: double the height and width of the input_grid\n  - object: colored_pixels\n    properties:\n      - condition: not black (0) and not azure (8)\n      - action: copied and mirrored horizontally within the top half of the output_grid\n  - object: azure_lines\n    properties:\n      - type: vertical\n      - location: flanking copied colored pixels in the top half of the output_grid.\n      - type: horizontal\n      - location: divides the output_grid in half.\n  - action: horizontal_mirroring\n    description: Colored pixels (excluding black and azure) from the input_grid are copied to the corresponding location and mirrored to the right side in the top half of the output grid.\n  - action: vertical_mirroring\n    description: The top half of the output_grid (above horizontal azure line) is mirrored to the bottom half.\n  - action: add_azure_separation\n    description: A horizontal line of azure pixels is added across entire output grid width at row index equal to the input_grid height.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Double Dimensions:** Create a new grid (output\\_grid) with twice the height and width of the original grid (input\\_grid).\n2.  **Copy and Mirror Horizontally:** Copy every colored pixel (not black or azure) from the input grid to the corresponding location in the *top half* of the new grid, and then mirror the pixel horizontally to the right side *within the top half*.\n3.  **Vertical Azure Highlight:** Add a vertical azure line on each side of the copied colored pixels in the *top half* of the output grid.\n4.  **Horizontal Azure Separation:** Add a horizontal azure line across the entire width of the output grid, positioned at the row index equal to the original input grid's height.\n5.  **Vertical Mirroring:** Mirror the top half of the grid (above the horizontal azure line) to the bottom half of the grid.\n\n"
