observations:
  - input_objects: "Varies per example, but consists of colored pixels (non-zero values) arranged in a grid."
  - duplication: "The input grid is duplicated in a 2x2 pattern, making the output grid twice the size in both dimensions."
  - filling: "Empty cells (value 0) in the output grid are filled with the value 8 (azure) based on adjacency to the duplicated input objects."
  - adjacency_rule: "An empty cell is filled with 8 if it's directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a cell containing a non-zero value from the original input, within the duplicated pattern."
  - output_objects: "The duplicated input objects, plus the connecting '8' pixels."
  - example_specific_observations:
      - example_1: "Input object is a single '5' (gray) pixel.  Output is a 2x2 repetition of the input with connecting 8s."
      - example_2: "Input objects are two '6' (magenta) pixels. Output includes 2x2 repetition and connecting 8s."
      - example_3: "Input objects include two '4' (yellow) pixels. Output includes 2x2 repetition and connecting 8s."
      - example_4: "Input objects include one '2' (red) pixels. Output includes 2x2 repetition and connecting 8s."
