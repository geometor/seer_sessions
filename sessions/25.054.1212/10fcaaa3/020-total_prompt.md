## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4890A380>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC4890A3B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. The input grid contains a single red pixel (value 2) at position (1, 1) (using 0-indexing), with all other pixels being white (value 0). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid. The red pixel from the input appears twice in the output, at (1, 1) and (1, 5), maintaining the row and alternating which column it takes. There are new azure (value 8) pixels introduced in the output in a checkered/alternating pattern starting on the first row and the first column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 4x4
  - output_grid_size: 8x8
  - input_pixel_color:
      red:
        value: 2
        location: (1, 1)
      white:
        value: 0
        location: all other positions
  - output_pixel_colors:
      red:
        value: 2
        locations: [(1, 1), (1, 5), (5,1), (5,5)]
      azure:
        value: 8
        locations: checkered pattern, starting at (0, 0)
      white:
        value: 0
        location: remaining positions
  - transformation_type: expansion and replication
  - expansion_factor_y: 2
  - expansion_factor_x: 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the Grid:** Double the size of the input grid in both dimensions (from 4x4 to 8x8).
2.  **Replicate Red Pixels**: Copy the red pixel from the original position (1,1) to output postion (1,1). Duplicate it horizontally by placing the copied pixel 4 columns to the right in the output grid as (1, 5). Then create two more red pixels in the same pattern, but shifted by four rows down: (5,1), (5,5)
3.  **Fill Azure Pixels:** Starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) of the *output* grid, fill in alternating pixels with azure (value 8). This creates a checkerboard pattern.
4. **Fill Empty Cells:** All the remaining empty cells in the expanded grid are filled with white pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
