task_description: >
  The task likely involves identifying and counting connected components
  of a specific color within a grid. The transformation could involve
  counting these components or using the count to generate a new output.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]  # Represents the colors present in the grid
      - dimensions: [rows, cols] # Height and width of the grid
  - name: connected_components
    type: set of pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - count: integer (number of connected components of that color)
  - name: output_grid # Placeholder, as we don't know the real output
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [rows, cols]

actions:
  - name: identify_connected_components
    input: input_grid, color
    output: connected_components
    description: >
      Identifies all distinct groups of connected pixels of the
      specified color.
  - name: count_connected_components
    input: connected_components
    output: count
    description: Counts the number of identified connected components.
  - name: generate_output # Placeholder, we need the real output to know for sure
    input: count # Placeholder, may include other inputs in reality
    output: output_grid

          Potentially creates a new grid based on the count, or it
          might modify the input grid.
