The output appears to be a single integer, also within the 0-9 range, seemingly summarizing or representing the input in a way using only one single value, '0' representing color white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It is not clear what is the function of the input image. It could very well be an alternative of just returning '0' every time, but that would be illogical for any kind of mapping. I will assume we are counting the number of white pixels.\n"
