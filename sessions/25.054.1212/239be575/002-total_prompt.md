## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0 8
2 2 8 0 0
2 2 0 0 8
0 0 0 2 2
8 8 0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4423E3E0>

**output:**
```
0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC4423F8B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output appears to be a single integer, also within the 0-9 range, seemingly summarizing or representing the input in a way using only one single value, '0' representing color white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Input grid representing colored pixels.
  - type: integer
    value: single digit (0-9)
    description: Output integer.

properties:
  - name: color
    values: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
    description: Mapping of integers to colors.
  - name: position
    type: coordinates (row, column)
    description: Location of a pixel within the grid.

actions:
   - None observed directly, possibly a summarization or counting.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_integer:  The output integer is derived from the input grid, likely through a counting or summarization process, perhaps even something more complex.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a grid, and output looks to be a summarization of it.
2.  Count the number of occurrences of white (0) pixels in the input grid.
3.  Output the single white(0) pixel representing the count. (This is only a guess and might very well be very wrong given there is only one example)

It is very hard to understand what is the logic of the transform in this case. It is not clear what is the function of the input image. It could very well be an alternative of just returning '0' every time, but that would be illogical for any kind of mapping. I will assume we are counting the number of white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
