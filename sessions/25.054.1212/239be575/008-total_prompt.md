## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 8 8 8 0
2 2 8 8 0 2 2
0 0 8 0 0 2 2
0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC47FBA020>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC47F93F10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves an input grid of colored pixels and a significantly smaller output grid. The output grid seems to represent a distillation or summarization of the input grid. The colors in the input grid are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The output grid contains only a single azure (8) pixel. This suggests the task might involve identifying a specific color or object within the input and representing it in the output, perhaps based on dominance, uniqueness, or some other criteria.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [5x7] # Input grid dimensions
      colors: [white, azure, red]
    relationships:
      - contains: pixels

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, azure, red, unknown] # Possible colors
    relationships:
      - part_of: grid
      - adjacent_to: [pixel]

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [1x1] # Output grid dimensions
      colors: [azure]
      
actions:
  - type: select
    description: "A single color (azure) is selected based on criteria from the input grid."

  - type: represent
     description: represent the selected color into another much smaller grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the most prominent or significant color/object in the input grid. In this case, it appears to be azure (8), although the criteria are not completely clear (it's not simply the most frequent color). It is somehow the most significant connected shape.

2.  **Create** a 1x1 output grid.

3.  **Set** the color of the single pixel in the output grid to the identified color (azure/8).

In essence, the transformation seems to reduce the input to its most salient feature/color represented as a single-pixel output. The key uncertainty lies in the precise rule for selecting that "most salient" color. It's likely related to a connected object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
