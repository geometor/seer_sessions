Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule takes a 3x3 input grid and expands it into a 6x6 output grid. Each pixel in the input grid is replicated as a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels 
    for i in range(input_height):
        for j in range(input_width):
            # Get the color of the current pixel
            color = input_grid[i, j]
            
            # Replicate the pixel to a 2x2 block in output_grid
            output_grid[2*i:2*i+2, 2*j:2*j+2] = color

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
