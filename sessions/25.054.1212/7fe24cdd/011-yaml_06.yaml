observations:
  - task_id: "010"
  - object_types:
    - input_grid:
        shape: 3x3
        properties: 2D array of color values
    - output_grid:
        shape: 6x6
        properties: 2D array of color values, composed of mirrored quadrants of input_grid
  - actions:
    - mirroring:
      types:
        - horizontal:  Flip the input grid left-to-right.
        - vertical: Flip the input grid top-to-bottom.
        - double: Perform both horizontal and vertical flips, resulting in 180-degree rotation
    - composition:
      description: Combine the original and mirrored grids to form the output.
  - quadrant_mapping:
