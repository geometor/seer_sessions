The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid appear to be replicated and rearranged in the output grid. There's a sense of mirroring or reflection, and possibly rotation, involved in the transformation. The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This is same as 180 degree rotation of input grid.\n\nIn essence, the input grid is replicated four times, with each quadrant of the output grid being either a direct copy or a mirrored version of the input.\n"
