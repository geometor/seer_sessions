The colors/values in the original grid seem to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern within the larger grid. There's a sense of expansion and possibly mirroring or reflection involved. The core concept seems to be inflating the original grid by a factor of 2 along both dimensions, with each original pixel expanding into a 2x2 block in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
