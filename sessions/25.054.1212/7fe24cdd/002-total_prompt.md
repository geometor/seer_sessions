## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 5 0
8 5 3
0 3 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A140>

**output:**
```
8 5 0 0 8 8
8 5 3 3 5 5
0 3 2 2 3 0
0 3 2 2 3 0
5 5 3 3 5 8
8 8 0 0 5 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors/values in the original grid seem to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern within the larger grid. There's a sense of expansion and possibly mirroring or reflection involved. The core concept seems to be inflating the original grid by a factor of 2 along both dimensions, with each original pixel expanding into a 2x2 block in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relationship: expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    factor: 2
    method: pixel_replication
  - action: replication
    description: Each pixel in the input_grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output_grid.
  - object: pixel
      type: grid_element
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the given 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Expansion:** Create a new, empty 6x6 output grid.
3.  **Pixel Replication:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Identify the pixel's color (integer value).
    *   In the output grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels with the same color, starting at the corresponding position (multiply the original row and column indices by 2 to find the top-left corner of the 2x2 block).
4. **Output:** return the output grid

In simple terms, each pixel is blown up into 4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
