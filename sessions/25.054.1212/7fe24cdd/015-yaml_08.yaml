facts:
  - observation: Each input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Each output grid is 6x6.
  - observation: Each cell in the input grid appears to map to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation involves an expansion of the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid appears to be generated based on a combination of the input cell's value and its neighbors.
  - observation: The corners have some sort of mirroring or reflection.
  - observation: The output cells have a pinwheel appearance.

  - action: expansion
    description: Each input cell expands into a 2x2 block in the output.
  - action: neighbor_interaction
    description: The values in the 2x2 output block are influenced by the input cell and its immediate neighbors.
  - action: zero_padding
    description: when operating on the boundaries, cells are zero padded
