Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, aiming to discern the transformation logic and express it in a structured way.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The colors present in the input grid (white/0, green/3, magenta/6) are also present in the output grid. The output grid appears to be a mirrored and expanded version of the input grid, with some kind of alternating pattern. It seems like each pixel in the input grid "expands" to occupy more space in the output, creating a 2x2 pattern that could represent interaction, like a cross product.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: green (3)
      - color: magenta (6)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: green (3)
      - color: magenta (6)
  - relationship: expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    type: mirrored, alternating, cross-product-like
  - observation: "output grid dimensions are double input grid dimensions"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions (height and width).

2.  **Expansion and Mirroring:** For each pixel in the input grid, perform a "cross-product-like" expansion in the output grid, where each of row, col in input creates a 2x2 block of cells at 2\*row, 2\*col, and also perform mirroring along rows and columns.

3.   **Cross Product Rule.** Each input cell at `input[row][col]` maps to four output cell locations, using the pattern created from the colors of the original cell, the horizontal neighbor and the vertical neighbor, inserting a "0" cell where there is no neighbor.

    *   `output[2*row][2*col] = input[row][col]`
    *    If there is a cell to the right at`input[row][col+1]`, then: `output[2*row][2*col + 1] = input[row][col+1]`
    *   If not: `output[2*row][2*col + 1] = 0`
    *   If there is a cell below at `input[row+1][col]`, then `output[2*row + 1][2*col] = input[row+1][col]`
    *    If not, `output[2*row+1][2*col] = 0`
    *    If there are cells below and to the right then: `output[2*row+1][2*col+1] = input[row][col]`

4.  **Repeat** this process for all cells in the input.

The core concept here is expansion of original pixels into a patterned 2x2 block
that is an interaction between the original and adjacent pixels.
