"""
The transformation rule takes a 3x3 input grid and expands it into a 6x6 output grid. The width and height are doubled. The current hypothesis about the precise pixel mapping within the enlarged grid is incorrect. The precise mapping between input and output pixels is more complex than simple replication. Each pixel from the input grid appears to influence multiple locations, and this must be solved. The current understanding is flawed and needs a new hypothesis based on close comparisons between all given examples.
