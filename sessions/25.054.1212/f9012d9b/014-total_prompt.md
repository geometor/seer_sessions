## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 2 2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7BFC47F93AF0>

**output:**
```
5 5
5 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC4890A200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into a smaller grid. The colors present in the input are red (2), gray (5), and white (0). The output grid seems to be significantly smaller than the input grid. The specific arrangement and colors in the output suggest a relationship with *specific* regions or colors in the input, not a simple downscaling or averaging.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements:
        - color: red (2)
        - color: gray (5)
        - color: white (0)
      regions:
          - name: top_left_corner
            bounds: [0:2, 0:2]
            dominant_color: red
          - name: third_row
            bounds: [2:3, 0:7]
            dominant_color: gray
          - name: bottom_right
            bounds: [5:7,5:7]
            dominant_color: white
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 2x2
      elements:
        - color: gray (5)
        - color: red (2)
relationships:
 - output_element_1: corresponds to input top left gray block
 - output_element_2: corresponds to top left red
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Specific Sub-grids:** Identify two distinct 2x2 regions within the input grid.
    *   The first region is the upper-leftmost four pixels.
    *   The second is a 2x2 region of just gray (5) at coordinates row 0 and column 2.

2.  **Check for Homogeneity and Color.** The process extracts colors if they appear in specific positions and patterns.
     * Look for color gray (5) within the top left four pixels and top right four pixels. If any gray present, then fill output grid with gray.
     * Look for color red (2) within same. If any red present, then fill the remaining slot on output with red.

3. **Construct Output:** Create the output using the color identified using the above rules.

In essence, the program seems to extracting information from a few distinct regions and their properties. The specific color and arrangement are crucial, suggesting a rule-based extraction rather than a calculation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
