The input grid appears to have a checkerboard pattern with alternating colors, except for a single '0' (white) cell. The output is a single cell containing one of the numbers/colors from the input grid. It seems like the most prominent, or perhaps most frequent, color from the input is selected for the output. The exception of '0' suggests it is ignored.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
