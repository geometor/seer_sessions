Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Repeating Color Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify repeating color blocks. A color block can be a single pixel or a larger contiguous area of the same color. Focus on the smallest repeatable unit.

2.  **Determine Representative Colors:** In example 2, the expected output is a single pixel representing the top-left color of the input. The rule seems to use the first occurrence of the color in the smallest repeatable unit.

3.  **Locate the Color Blocks:** In the input locate all examples of colors identified in step 2.

4. **Reconstruct:** If there are multiple colors, and multiple objects in the input, reconstruct the blocks, but using only colors identified in the repeatable units.

5. **Output**: output should only contain the colors from the smallest repeating pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
