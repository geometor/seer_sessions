## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4890B7F0>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC47F93AF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation from a grid of numbers (representing colors) to a single number (also representing a color). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard pattern with alternating colors, except for a single '0' (white) cell. The output is a single cell containing one of the numbers/colors from the input grid. It seems like the most prominent, or perhaps most frequent, color from the input is selected for the output. The exception of '0' suggests it is ignored.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: A 4x4 grid of numbers representing colors.
    properties:
      - pattern: Checkerboard-like alternation of two colors (8 and 6).
      - exception: One cell with the value 0.
  - type: output
    description: A single cell containing a number.
    properties:
      - value: Corresponds to one of the colors in the input grid (8).
  - type: relationship
    description: Output value appears to be the most frequent non-zero color in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Identify all unique values, excluding '0'.
2.  **Count occurrences:** For each unique, non-zero value, count how many times it appears in the grid.
3.  **Determine the maximum:** Find the value with the highest count.
4. **Produce output** return the color that occurred most often.

Essentially the output is the most frequent non-zero color/number.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
