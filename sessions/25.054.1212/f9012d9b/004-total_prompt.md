Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of extracting the top-left 2x2 subgrid was too simplistic and only coincidentally related to the correct transformation in the first example. The subsequent examples reveal that this approach is incorrect. It fails to capture the actual underlying logic, leading to mismatches in both size and pixel values. The core issue is that the transformation isn't consistently about the top-left 2x2. We need a more dynamic, pattern-based approach. The second example hints at a single value. The varied color palettes and shapes should be the key.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Abandon fixed subgrid extraction:** The top-left 2x2 extraction is not a general rule.
2.  **Analyze color patterns and repetition:** Look for patterns in how colors are arranged and repeated in the input and output grids.
3.  **Consider object properties:** Think of contiguous blocks of color as objects. Analyze their size, shape, and position.
4.  **Re-evaluate the output sizes** The function is getting the output size correct sometimes, but the contents are incorrect - we must re-evaluate our hypothesis about what is generating output and change the code to adapt.
5.  **Focus on relationships:** Investigate relationships between objects/color blocks in the input and corresponding elements in the output.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To better understand the patterns, I'll describe each example in terms of objects (contiguous color blocks) and their properties, along with an assessment of how the generated output relates to the expected output.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Alternating columns of red/blue and blue/blue.
    *   Bottom rows introduce white.

*   **Expected Output:**
    *    A single column of blue over red.

*   **Transformed Output:**
    *   Top-left 2x2 subgrid (red, blue, blue, blue).

*   **Analysis:** Incorrect. The transformed output matches neither the colors nor the pattern of the expected output in a meaningful way. The result captures two colors from the input but in the wrong configuration.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Checkerboard pattern of azure and magenta.

*   **Expected Output:**
    *   Single azure pixel.

*   **Transformed Output:**
    *   Top-left 2x2 subgrid (azure, magenta, magenta, azure).

*   **Analysis:** Incorrect. The expected output is a single pixel, but the transformed output is 2x2. This suggests a reduction to a single representative color, or object, but the extraction method is flawed.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Alternating columns of two red and two green, interspersed with columns of five grey. The bottom rows include white.

*   **Expected Output:**
    *   2x2 of green over red, two columns

*   **Transformed Output:**
    *   Top-left 2x2 subgrid (red, red, red, red).

*   **Analysis:** Incorrect. While the size is correct this time, the content (all red) does not match the expected output (green and red). This indicates a failure in color selection logic.

**YAML Facts:**

      - color: white
        shape: partial_rows
        count: 2
    output_objects:
      - color: green
        shape: block
      - color: red
        shape: block
    transformation: "select_specific_color_blocks"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Repeating Color Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify repeating color blocks. A color block can be a single pixel or a larger contiguous area of the same color. Focus on the smallest repeatable unit.

2.  **Determine Representative Colors:** In example 2, the expected output is a single pixel representing the top-left color of the input. The rule seems to use the first occurrence of the color in the smallest repeatable unit.

3.  **Locate the Color Blocks:** In the input locate all examples of colors identified in step 2.

4. **Reconstruct:** If there are multiple colors, and multiple objects in the input, reconstruct the blocks, but using only colors identified in the repeatable units.

5. **Output**: output should only contain the colors from the smallest repeating pattern.

Rethinking the natural language program. The key seems to be identifying a *minimal repeating unit* within the input, and then representing characteristics of that unit in the output. The output uses the colors from that unit. The size of the output is related to either the smallest repeating unit or perhaps the number of unique colors in that unit.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
