The colors are represented by integers (0-9), with a known mapping to specific colors (e.g., 0 is white, 1 is blue, 2 is red). The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on a subset of colors and potentially their arrangement or count. The key seems to be identifying a pattern or rule that dictates which parts of the input grid are represented in the output, and how. It seems that only the colors blue(1) and red(2) from the top left corner are in output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
