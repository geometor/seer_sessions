The primary colors involved are red (2), azure (8), and white (0). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x5). The transformation seems to involve some form of mirroring or reflection, specifically affecting the azure (8) and red (2) rows, while leaving the white (0) rows unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Place the azure (8) at the original red(2) row position, and the red (2) at the original azure (8) location.\n4.  **Output.** Combine the unchanged white(0) rows with the transformed azure(8) and red(2) rows at their new locations. The result is the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation swaps the positions of the \"red\" and \"azure\" rows, while leaving the \"white\" rows untouched, effectively performing a kind of selective vertical reflection around the center of the grid.\n"
