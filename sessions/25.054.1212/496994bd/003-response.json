            "text": "Okay, here's an assessment of the situation, the strategy for improvement, and the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting Python code were on the right track, correctly identifying the mirroring/inversion aspect of the transformation. However, it's clear from the test results that the original assumption\u2014mirroring the *top three rows*\u2014is too rigid. Specifically the transform should only mirror to match the size of the output. The strategy will involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze Output Size:** Determine the height of the output grid in each example. This is crucial because the amount of the input to mirror corresponds to added height of the output.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Row Selection:** Modify the program to select the rows to be mirrored. The difference between output height and input height, reveals the number of rows mirrored.\n\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the description to reflect the output-size dependent nature of the mirroring.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant metrics:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Height: 10\n    *   Output Height: 10\n    *   Rows Mirrored (Expected): 3\n    *   Rows Mirrored (Current Code): 3\n    *   Height Difference: 0\n    *   Notes: The input height is only extended by the number of mirrored lines.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Height: 10\n    *   Output Height: 10\n    *   Rows Mirrored (Expected): 3\n    *   Rows Mirrored (Current Code): 3\n        *   Height Difference: 0\n    *   Notes: The input height is only extended by the number of mirrored lines.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      height: variable\n      width: variable\n      colors: [0-9] # Represents color indices\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      height: variable, greater than or equal to input_grid height\n      width: same as input_grid width\n      colors: same as input_grid colors\n  - action: mirror_top_section\n    description: A section from the top of the input_grid is mirrored (inverted vertically) and appended to the bottom.\n    parameters:\n      rows_to_mirror: output_grid.height - input_grid.height\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Determine Output Size:** Observe the height of the `output_grid`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Mirrored Section Height:** Subtract the `input_grid` height from the `output_grid` height. This difference represents the number of rows to mirror.\n\n3. **Mirror and Append:**\n   - if the difference is greater than 0:\n        - Take the top N rows from the `input_grid`, where N is the number of rows to mirror (calculated in step 2).\n        - Vertically flip (mirror) this extracted section.\n        - Append the flipped section to the bottom of the `input_grid`.\n    - if the difference is 0:\n        - return the original input grid\n4.  **Output:** The modified grid is the `output_grid`.\n"
