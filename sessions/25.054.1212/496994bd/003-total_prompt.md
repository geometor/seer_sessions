Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation takes the top three rows of the input and mirrors/inverts it, placing the added section it to the bottom of the grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by inverting and appending a copy of the top three rows to the bottom.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Extract the top three rows
    top_rows = input_grid[0:3, :]
    
    #Invert the top section

    # Append the inverted section to the bottom of the output grid
    output_grid = np.concatenate((output_grid, inverted_rows), axis=0)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
