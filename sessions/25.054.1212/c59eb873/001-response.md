Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into a 6x6 grid. The output grid appears to be a "doubled" version of the input grid, with each original pixel replicated in a 2x2 block. The colors from the input are maintained in the output. The core concept is spatial duplication.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      values: integers (0-9)
      mapping: color_map

actions:
  - name: duplicate
    type: spatial
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.

relationships:
  - type: one-to-many
    description: One input pixel corresponds to four output pixels.
  - type: spatial_adjacency
    description: Adjacency relationships between pixels in input are preserved (scaled up) between blocks of pixels in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input 3x3 grid.
2.  For each pixel, **retrieve** its color value.
3.  In the output 6x6 grid, **create** a 2x2 block of pixels.
4.  **Assign** the retrieved color value to all four pixels within the 2x2 block.
5. The top-left corner of each 2x2 block in output is determined by multiplying the row and column indices from the input by two.

In simpler terms:  The input grid is expanded by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Each original pixel becomes a 2x2 square of the same color in the output.
