The colors in the output grid appear to be derived from the input grid, specifically from the corners. The size reduction is substantial. The most obvious pattern is that some corner pixels from the input are retained in the output, and other colors within the input grid are discarded.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Place the color of the bottom-middle-x corner pixel (where x is width -3) in the bottom-right position of the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the four corner pixels of the input grid and uses them to create a 2x2 output grid, preserving the relative corner positions, except for the right corner.\n"
