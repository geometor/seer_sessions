## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 6 6
1 6 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475003A0>

**output:**
```
6 6 6 6 6 6
1 6 1 1 6 1
8 8 6 6 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC47500D30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be transformed into a wider output grid. The core transformation seems to involve a horizontal duplication of each original column. The colors (represented by numbers) remain consistent during this duplication.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array (rows x columns)
      - elements: pixels (integers representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: duplicate_column
    description: Replicates a column of pixels horizontally.
    input: grid, column_index
    output: modified grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a pixel in the input grid based on column duplication.  The column index in the output grid is twice the column index in the input grid (and twice plus one).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Column Duplication:** For each column in the input grid:
    *   Duplicate the entire column immediately to its right. This means every pixel in the original column is copied to the adjacent position in the horizontal direction.
3. **Output:** The resulting grid, with each original column now doubled, is the output. In other words, the width of the output grid is twice the width of the input grid. The height remains the same.

In simpler terms, the transformation takes each column of the input and stretches it horizontally by a factor of 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
