            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept of moving a single non-zero pixel diagonally up and left and changing its color. However, it only works for Example 2. The other examples show that there's more to the transformation than just moving the red pixel. There are additional pixels of other colors (6, 7, and 8) appearing in the expected output that are not accounted for in the current code or natural language program. The strategy needs to shift from simply moving one pixel to understanding *why* and *where* these new pixels are appearing, and incorporate that into the program.\n\nThe primary error seems to stem from focusing too narrowly on the initial observation (moving the red pixel). It's failing to account for a more complex pattern that includes the addition of other colored pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* examples, paying close attention to the relationship between the input and output grids. Specifically, look at the positions of the new colored pixels relative to the original red pixel.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:** Formulate a new hypothesis about the rule, considering:\n    *   Is there a consistent pattern to where the new pixels appear?\n    *   Do the colors of the new pixels (6, 7, 8) have a specific meaning or order?\n    *   Is the original red pixel *always* changed to green and moved, or is that just a part of a larger pattern?\n\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the new hypothesis, rewrite the natural language program to clearly and concisely describe the *complete* transformation rule.\n\n4.  **Update Code:**  Modify the Python code to implement the revised natural language program.\n\n5.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code against *all* training examples and repeat steps 3-5 until all examples produce the expected output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Red (2) at (1, 1)\n    *   Output: Green (3) at (0, 0), Gray(6) at (0,2), Azure(8) at (2,0) and Orange(7) at (2,2)\n    *   Observation: The Green pixel moves as expected. Gray, Azure and Orange pixels appear around the initial location of the red pixel in a cross, 2 steps up, 2 steps down and 2 steps right.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Red (2) at (2, 4)\n    *   Output: Green (3) at (1, 3)\n    *   Observation: Only the Green pixel appears at the expected, moved location.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Red (2) at (0, 2)\n    *   Output: Azure(8) at(1,1), and Orange(7) at (1,3)\n    *   Observation: The Green pixel expected at location (-1, 1), it is outside the output grid. Azure and Orange pixels are present, 1 step away from the input red pixel.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: Red (2) at (1, 3)\n    *   Output: Green(3) at (0,2), Gray(6) at (0,4), Azure(8) at (2,2) and Orange(7) at (2, 4)\n    *   Observation: The Green pixel moved as expected. Gray, Azure and Orange pixels appear around the initial location of the red pixel, in a cross shape, 1 step away.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: red_pixel\n    color: 2 # Red\n    initial_position: Varies per example\n    behavior: Moved diagonally up and left, color changes to green.\n  - name: green_pixel\n    color: 3 # Green\n    final_position: One position up and one position left from red_pixel's initial position.\n    behavior: Appears as a result of moving the red_pixel.\n  - name: gray_pixel\n    color: 6  # Gray\n    behavior: Appears adjacent to the moved red_pixel in some cases.\n  - name: azure_pixel\n    color: 8  # Azure\n    behavior: Appears adjacent to the moved red_pixel in some cases.\n  - name: orange_pixel\n    color: 7  # Orange\n    behavior: Appears adjacent to the moved red_pixel in some cases.\n\nactions:\n  - name: move_pixel\n    description: Moves a pixel one unit up and one unit left.\n  - name: change_color\n    description: Changes the color of the red pixel to green.\n  - name: add_pixels\n    description: Add gray, Azure and Orange pixels in the locations specified.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Locate:** Find the single red (2) pixel in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Move and Recolor:** Move the red pixel one position diagonally up and to the left. Change its color to green (3). If the new position is outside the grid, do not place the green pixel.\n\n3.  **Conditional Addition.**:\n    -   If after the move, the green pixel is placed inside the grid: Create Gray(6), Azure(8) and Orange(7) pixels in a cross shape, with green(3) pixel as the center:\n\n    ```\n      .  .  6  .  .\n      .  .  3  .  .\n      .  .  8  .  .\n    ```\n    -   If the green pixel is not placed(because the new location is out of the grid): Create Azure(8) and Orange(7) pixels at the same relative position to the input red pixel as they would have been related to the green pixel, in the previous case:\n\n    ```\n      .  .  .  .  .\n      .  8  2  7  .\n      .  .  .  .  .\n    ```\n\n4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with all other cells set to 0.\n"
