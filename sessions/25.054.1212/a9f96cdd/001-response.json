Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x5 in this example). The primary difference appears to be the positions and values of the non-zero elements. The background is consistently 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

All of the non-zero values in the output are new values that are not 0 or 2.\n\n3.  **Reposition:** The locations of non-zero pixels in the input are empty (value is 0) in the output. The new values appear to be place in a non-overlapping fashion. There does not appear to be enough information to establish where or why the placement occurs.\n\nIt seems as if there may be two phases to how the output is created. First, it seems like we take the non-zero values from the output and remove them. Second, we consider the space of empty cells and consider adding objects of new colors in the empty space.\n"
