facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains a single red pixel (value 2) at coordinates (2, 4).
      The rest of the input is white (value 0)
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains a single green pixel (value 3) at coordinates (1, 3).
      The rest of the output is white (value 0)
  - action: |
      A single pixel changes its color and position between the input and output.
  - property_change: |
      The pixel's color changes from red (2) to green (3).
  - movement: |
      The pixel moves diagonally up and to the left.
  - coordinates:
    input_pixel: [2, 4]
    output_pixel: [1, 3]
