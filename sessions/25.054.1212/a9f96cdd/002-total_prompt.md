## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7BFC47578E80>

**output:**
```
3 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
8 0 7 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7BFC475454B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x5 in this example). The primary difference appears to be the positions and values of the non-zero elements. The background is consistently 0 (white).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
    background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
    background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: object
    description: non-zero pixels
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - position: (row, column)

  - type: relationship
    description: transformation
    between: input grid and output grid
    details: Changes in position and value of non-zero pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.

2.  **Transform Values:** In this example, the is a single object of value 2. All of the non-zero values in the output are new values that are not 0 or 2.

3.  **Reposition:** The locations of non-zero pixels in the input are empty (value is 0) in the output. The new values appear to be place in a non-overlapping fashion. There does not appear to be enough information to establish where or why the placement occurs.

It seems as if there may be two phases to how the output is created. First, it seems like we take the non-zero values from the output and remove them. Second, we consider the space of empty cells and consider adding objects of new colors in the empty space.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
