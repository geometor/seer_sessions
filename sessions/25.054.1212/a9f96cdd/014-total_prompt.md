## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7BFC48909A20>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 7 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7BFC48909C30>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.
*   The grids are composed of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9).
*   Each digit corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the color map, though the colors appear to be displayed).
*   The input grid seems to have a single colored pixel (red, value 2) in this specific case, while the rest are white (value 0).
*    The output grid has two other colors in the second row, azure (8) and orange(7).
*   The output maintains the same grid dimensions as the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: pixels
    values: [0, 2]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: pixels
    values: [0, 7, 8]

  - type: object
    description: red pixel
    color: red
    input_position: [0, 2]
    value: 2
    
  - type: object
    description: azure pixel
    color: azure
    output_position: [1,1]
    value: 8

  - type: object
    description: orange pixel
    color: orange
    output_position: [1,3]
    value: 7

  - type: relationship
    description: input to output transformation
    rule: replace the red pixel with azure and orange in second row, while maintaining grid dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an input grid of dimensions 3x5.
2.  **Locate:** Note the red pixel (value 2) in the top row at position (0,2).
3.  **Transformation**: Create azure colored pixel with value 8 and orange colored pixel with value 7 in the second row of the output grid. Azure is one row down and one column to the left and orange is one row down and one column to the right, relative to the input red pixel.
4. **Output:** maintain original grid size and all the white pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
