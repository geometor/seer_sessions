Both grids are of the same dimensions (3x5 in this example).  The grids contain single-digit integer values, representing colors. The primary change observed is the movement and color change of a single non-zero pixel. Specifically, a red pixel (value 2) in the input becomes a green pixel (value 3) in the output, and its position shifts.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
