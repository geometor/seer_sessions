The input grid appears to contain single-digit integers, each representing a distinct color. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, where each original pixel is replicated in a 2x2 block. Additionally, the output grid introduces '0' (white) colored pixels in the padding areas around and between the replicated 2x2 blocks.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
