## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 8 4
8 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x128 at 0x7BFC47547E20>

**output:**
```
0 1 8 4 0
1 1 8 4 4
8 8 3 8 8
0 8 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x256 at 0x7BFC47547850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to be embedded within the output grid, and its elements are duplicated. There's also the introduction of '0' (white) pixels in the output grid, seemingly acting as a border or padding. The original colors and their relative positions within the input grid are preserved in the duplicated elements in the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    actions:
      - embedded: input grid is placed within the output grid
      - duplicated: elements of the input grid are copied
      - padded:  output grid has additional rows and columns filled with '0'
relationships:
  - input_grid: smaller, source of data
  - output_grid: larger, contains embedded and duplicated input data, padded with '0'
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Padding:** Create a new grid (output) that is larger than the input grid. The output grid should have two extra rows and two extra columns compared to the input. Fill the new rows and columns in the corners with '0'.
2.  **Embed:** Copy the entire input grid into the center of the output grid, starting one row and one column down and to the right (leave the 0 padding at the top and left sides).
3.  **Duplicate Top Row**: Duplicate the first row of the input grid one row above in the output grid.
4. **Duplicate Bottom Row**: Duplicate the last row of the input grid one row below in the output grid.
5. **Duplicate Left Column**: Duplicate the first column of the input grid one column to the left in the output grid.
6. **Duplicate Right Column**: Duplicate the last column of the input grid one column to the right in the output grid.

Essentially, the input grid is embedded within the output grid, with rows and columns duplicated, and then zero padding added at the four corners.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
