## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 2
3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC47547E20>

**output:**
```
0 1 2 0
1 1 2 2
3 3 8 8
0 3 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC475456F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to contain single-digit integers, each representing a distinct color. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, where each original pixel is replicated in a 2x2 block. Additionally, the output grid introduces '0' (white) colored pixels in the padding areas around and between the replicated 2x2 blocks.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - elements: single-digit integers (1, 2, 3, 8) representing colors
      - role: source data
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - elements: single-digit integers, including '0'
      - role: transformed data
  - type: pixel
    description: individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - value: integer representing a color
      - location: row and column index
actions:
  - name: replication
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated to form a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - name: padding
    description:  '0' (white) pixels are added as padding.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a spatially expanded version of the input grid, with added padding.
  - type: element-wise
    description: Each input pixel corresponds to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the dimensions of the input grid (2x width, 2x height).
2.  **Replication:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Copy the pixel's value.
    *   Create a 2x2 block in the output grid, starting at the position (2 \* row, 2 \* column) where row and column are the coordinates of the current input pixel.
    *  Fill all four cells of this 2x2 block with the copied pixel value.
3. **Padding**: Fill the remaining cells (those not part of any 2x2 replication) of output grid with 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
