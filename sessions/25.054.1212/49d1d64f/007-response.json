The input grid seems to be embedded within the output grid, and its elements are duplicated. There's also the introduction of '0' (white) pixels in the output grid, seemingly acting as a border or padding. The original colors and their relative positions within the input grid are preserved in the duplicated elements in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output grid should have two extra rows and two extra columns compared to the input. Fill the new rows and columns in the corners with '0'.\n2.  **Embed:** Copy the entire input grid into the center of the output grid, starting one row and one column down and to the right (leave the 0 padding at the top and left sides).\n3.  **Duplicate Top Row**: Duplicate the first row of the input grid one row above in the output grid.\n4. **Duplicate Bottom Row**: Duplicate the last row of the input grid one row below in the output grid.\n5. **Duplicate Left Column**: Duplicate the first column of the input grid one column to the left in the output grid.\n6. **Duplicate Right Column**: Duplicate the last column of the input grid one column to the right in the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the input grid is embedded within the output grid, with rows and columns duplicated, and then zero padding added at the four corners.\n"
