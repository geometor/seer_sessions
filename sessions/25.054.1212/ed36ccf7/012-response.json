One will be color 0 (white), and the other will be a non-zero color (the \"active\" color).\n\n2. Top-Left Corner: The color of the top-left cell in the output grid is always the \"active\" color.\n\n3. Diagonal Fill:\n    - consider the diagonals of the grid running from top-left to bottom-right.\n    - The non-zero color from the input grid replaces the 0 (white) color along these diagonals, starting from the top-left. The replacement proceeds along a diagonal until a cell of non-zero color is encountered in the input or the diagonal has completed.\n    - The process then continues with the next diagonal\n\n4. Preserve Counts: Ensure that the total number of pixels of each color remains the same between the input and output grids. If there are not enough '0' cells available, existing locations from input are used in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_diagonals(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of diagonals in the grid, from top-left to bottom-right.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    diagonals = []\n    for i in range(rows + cols - 1):\n        diagonal = []\n        for j in range(max(0, i - rows + 1), min(i + 1, cols)):\n            row = i - j\n            col = j\n            diagonal.append((row, col))\n        diagonals.append(diagonal)\n    return diagonals\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Identify Colors\n    colors = np.unique(input_grid)\n    active_color = colors[colors != 0][0]  # The non-zero color\n    background_color = 0\n\n    # Top-Left Corner\n    output_grid[0, 0] = active_color\n\n    # Diagonal Fill\n    diagonals = get_diagonals(input_grid)\n    active_color_count = np.sum(input_grid == active_color)\n    active_color_placed = 0\n\n    for diagonal in diagonals:\n        for row, col in diagonal:\n            if active_color_placed < active_color_count:\n                if input_grid[row,col] == background_color:\n                    output_grid[row, col] = active_color\n                    active_color_placed +=1\n            else:\n                break\n\n\n    # Preserve Counts: This part is implicitly handled by the diagonal fill\n    # and the active_color_placed limit.\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
