The grid cells contain either the value '0' (white) or '2' (red). The transformation appears to involve some form of manipulation of the red ('2') pixels, possibly a reflection or rotation. The white ('0') pixels seem to change their position in relation to the changes in the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
