## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 6 6
6 0 0
6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93F10>

**output:**
```
6 0 0
6 0 6
6 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A0610>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain two distinct colors (represented by the digits 0 and 6, likely white and magenta). The transformation appears to involve a manipulation of the positions of these colors within the grid. The overall grid structure (3x3) remains constant.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 6]
    element_names: {0: white, 6: magenta}

  - object: color_block_0
    color: 0
    initial_positions: [[0,0], [1,1], [2,2]]
    final_positions:  [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]]

  - object: color_block_6
    color: 6
    initial_positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [2,0], [2,1]]
    final_positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [1,2], [2,0],[2,1], [2,2]]
  - action: rotate colors
    agent: none specified
    parameters:  rotate the magenta color 90 degree clockwise.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** Recognize the two colors present in the input grid: white (0) and magenta (6).

2.  **Rotate Magenta:** Exchange the positions of colors in first row, copy value at (0,1) to (0,0) and value at (0,2) to (1,2).
    Exchange column value, copy value at (1,0) to (2,0).
    Copy (2,1) to (2,2).

3. **Result:** The output grid is the result of the steps applied on the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
