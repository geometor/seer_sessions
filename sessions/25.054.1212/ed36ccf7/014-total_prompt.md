## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 9
0 0 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48DA7D90>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
0 0 9
0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and maroon (9). The output grid also contains the same two colors, but their arrangement is different. It appears to be some form of rotation or reflection.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color_values: [0, 9]
        color_names: [white, maroon]

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Re-arrangement of pixels based on rotation or reflection
    
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The input and output grids have the same dimensions but different spatial arrangements of color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid. The top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, the middle row of the input becomes the middle column of the output, and the bottom row of the input becomes the leftmost column of the output.

More concisely: Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
