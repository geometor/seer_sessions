## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC47503B50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
2 2 2 2 4 2
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC475006A0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids appear to have the same dimensions (6x6 in this example). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a different color. The primary difference between the input and output is a change in the third row and fifth column. In the input, row 3 has two red pixels (value 2) at the beginning and the rest are white pixels (0). In the input, column 5 has two azure pixels (value 8) in the top two positions. In the output a yellow pixel (value 4) and some of the white pixels have become red.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [0,5], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,5], [2,2], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [3,0], [3,1], [3,2], [3,3], [3,4], [3,5], [4,0], [4,1], [4,2], [4,3], [4,4], [4,5], [5,0], [5,1], [5,2], [5,3], [5,4], [5,5]]
      - value: 2
        color: red
        positions: [[2,0], [2,1]]
      - value: 8

      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        positions: [[2,4]]
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        positions: [[0,4], [1,4], [3,4], [4,4], [5,4]]
  - type: observation
    description: "The azure (8) column and red (2) row intersect at the yellow (4) pixel"
  - type: operation
    description: "The white pixels adjacent to the red row become red, stopping at the intersection"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Features:** Locate the horizontal row containing red pixels (value '2') and the vertical column containing azure pixels (value '8').

2.  **Intersection:** Find the cell where the identified row and column intersect. Change this cell's value to yellow (value '4').

3.  **Propagation:**  Extend the red pixels (2) to the right along the row until you meet the cell intersecting the azure column.

4.  **Replicate:** Copy the azure pixels vertically along the whole column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
