## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC47503B50>

**output:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
2 4 2 2 2 2
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC47500F40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of the same dimensions (6x6). Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4). There's a transformation occurring where elements in the input grid influence elements in the output grid, suggesting object interaction or pattern replication. Specifically, I perceive a vertical azure object and horizontal red object that causes a mixed yellow object.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are 6x6.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains a vertical line of two azure (8) pixels in the second column.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains a horizontal line of two red (2) pixels in the fourth row, fifth and sixth columns.
  - observation: |
     The output has a copy of the azure object, increased to three and copied to the row below and two rows below the original azure object.
  - observation: |
     The two red object has expanded to include 3 more red pixels, and the yellow pixel has taken the location of one of the original red pixels.
  - observation: |
     The location of the yellow object is where the vertical and horizontal lines intersect.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy and Extend Azure:** Locate the vertical azure (8) line in the input grid. Copy this line to the output grid. Extend the copied line downwards by one additional azure pixel and by two.
2.  **Copy and Extend Red:** Locate the horizontal red (2) object. Copy and expand to fill the row, except where the azure object is.
3.  **Create Intersection:** Find the intersection point of the extended azure line (from step 1) and the original red line (from step 2).
4.  **Yellow Intersection**: Create a single pixel sized yellow(4) object at the intersection.
5. All other values in the output will match the input, in this case, the white background.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
