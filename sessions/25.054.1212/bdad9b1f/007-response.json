Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4). There's a transformation occurring where elements in the input grid influence elements in the output grid, suggesting object interaction or pattern replication. Specifically, I perceive a vertical azure object and horizontal red object that causes a mixed yellow object.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Extend the copied line downwards by one additional azure pixel and by two.\n2.  **Copy and Extend Red:** Locate the horizontal red (2) object. Copy and expand to fill the row, except where the azure object is.\n3.  **Create Intersection:** Find the intersection point of the extended azure line (from step 1) and the original red line (from step 2).\n4.  **Yellow Intersection**: Create a single pixel sized yellow(4) object at the intersection.\n5. All other values in the output will match the input, in this case, the white background.\n\n"
