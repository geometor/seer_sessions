Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Red Row:** Identify the row that contains red pixels.
2.  **Find the Azure Column:** Identify the column that contains azure pixels.
3.  **Mark Intersection:** Change the color of the cell where the red row and azure column intersect to yellow.
4.  **Extend Red:** Starting from the beginning of the red row, change all pixels to red until the intersection with the azure column is reached.
5.  **Extend Azure Conditionally:**  If there are azure pixels above the red row, extend the azure color upwards in the azure column to the top of the grid. If there are azure pixels *below* the red row, extend the azure color downwards in the azure column to the bottom of the grid. If both are true, connect them all.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
