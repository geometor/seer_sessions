Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a grid by inverting a frame of pixels around a central pixel, 
keeping the central pixel unchanged. The inversion changes non-zero pixels
to zero, but leaves zero pixels unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Identify the center pixel coordinates
    center_row = rows // 2
    center_col = cols // 2

    # Iterate through the grid to process the frame
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the pixel is on the frame (outermost rows and columns)
            if i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1:
                # Exclude the center pixel from the inversion
                if i != center_row or j != center_col:
                    # Invert frame pixels: non-zero becomes 0, 0 remains 0
                    if output_grid[i, j] != 0:
                        output_grid[i, j] = 0
            # copy non-frame pixels
            else:
               output_grid[i,j] = input_grid[i,j]

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
