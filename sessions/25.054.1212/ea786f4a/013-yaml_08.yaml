    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - initial_state: predominantly green (3), single central white pixel (0)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - location: row, column indices within grid
  - action: color_inversion
    description: swapping color values based on a defined rule
    parameters:
      - original_color: the color to be replaced.
      - replacement_color: The color to replace with.
  - relationship: spatial_pattern
    description: The pattern of color inversion forms a cross shape centered on the initial white pixel.
    properties:
      - shape: cross
      - center: location of the original white pixel
