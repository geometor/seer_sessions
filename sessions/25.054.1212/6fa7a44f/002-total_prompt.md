## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 1 4
9 1 4
2 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47503250>

**output:**
```
9 1 4
9 1 4
2 1 1
2 1 1
9 1 4
9 1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC47502770>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares. Each color represents a digit from 0-9. The input grid transforms into a larger output grid. The output grid appears to be a patterned repetition of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (input)
      - dimensions: 6x3 (output)
      - elements: colored squares (pixels)
      - colors: represent digits 0-9
    relationships:
      - output grid is a transformation of the input grid

actions:
  - type: repetition
    details: The input grid is duplicated and stacked to form the output grid.
    parameters:
      - vertical_repetition: 2
      - horizontal_repetition: 1

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid.
2.  **Duplicate** the input grid vertically once.
3.  **Stack** the duplicate below the original grid.
4. **Concatenate** to produce final grid

The transformation rule is to repeat the input grid once vertically. The output is the input grid with itself appended below. There's one input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
