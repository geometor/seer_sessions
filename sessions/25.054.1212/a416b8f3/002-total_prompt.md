## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48908D00>

**output:**
```
0 5 0 0 5 0
5 5 2 5 5 2
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid that is double the width. The pattern in the input grid seems to be replicated horizontally in the output grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (input), 3x6 (output)
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    relationships:
      - input_grid: Contains a pattern of colored pixels.
      - output_grid: Contains a horizontally mirrored/duplicated version of the input grid.

actions:
  - type: duplication
    properties:
      - axis: horizontal
    details: The input grid's pattern is repeated to the right to form the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe Input:** Take the input grid, which is a 3x3 matrix of color values.
2.  **Duplicate Horizontally:** Create a new grid with the same number of rows, double the number of original columns
3. **Copy:** Copy the values from the input to the output in their respective places.
4.  **Replicate:** Copy each column of the input grid to its adjacent right column in the output grid, effectively mirroring the input horizontally.

In essence, the transformation rule is to duplicate the input grid horizontally. Each column in the input is replicated once, resulting in an output grid twice the width.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
