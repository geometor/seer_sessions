      input_objects:
        - color: red
          positions: [(0, 1)]
          shape: single pixel
        - color: azure
          positions: [(0, 5)]
          shape: single pixel
      output_objects:
        - color: red
          positions: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (5,0)]
          shape: vertical line of alternating pixels
        - color: azure
          positions: [(0, 5), (1,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
          shape: vertical line of alternating pixels
      transformation:  Copy existing pixels, then iteratively add a pixel of the same color directly below each colored pixel, until no new pixels are added.

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: yellow
          positions: [(0, 1)]
          shape: single pixel
      output_objects:
        - color: yellow
          positions: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (5,0)]
          shape:  vertical line of alternating pixels
      transformation: Copy existing pixels, then iteratively add a pixel of the same color directly below each colored pixel, until no new pixels are added.

general_transformation:
  rule: >
     All non-background color pixels in the input grid trigger the creation of a new pixel
     of the same color directly below them.  This process repeats for any newly created
     pixels until no more pixels can be added. The background is copied.
