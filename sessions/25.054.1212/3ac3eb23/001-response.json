Most of the grid is white (0), with a few red (2) and azure (8) pixels.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 2D grid with the same dimensions as the input. It seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The core structure and white pixels are maintained. The previously-red and previously-azure colored pixels generate additional colored pixels.\n*  The added pixels are on odd-numbered rows.\n* **Colors:** The relevant colors appear to be white (0), red (2), and azure (8).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
