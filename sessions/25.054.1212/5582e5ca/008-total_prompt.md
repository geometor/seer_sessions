## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC489F7DF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid. The input grid has a variety of colors/digits, while the output grid is entirely filled with the digit 9 (maroon). The critical observation is that the output grid is a uniform grid with all cells being '9', regardless of input values.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - observation: Integers range from 1 to 9, representing different colors.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - observation: All integers in the output grid are 9 (maroon).
  - relationship: Output grid's color is uniform, regardless of the input.
  - action: Input grid is replaced with a uniform grid of color 9.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the dimensions of the input grid.** In this specific example, it's a 3x3 grid, but the program should be general for any rectangular grid size.
2.  **Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.**
3.  **Fill all cells of the new grid with the value 9.**
4.  **Output the new grid.**

Essentially, the program replaces any input grid with a grid of the same dimension and completely filled with 9s.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
