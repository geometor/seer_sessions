## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC489F7E20>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC489F7DF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color (yellow, represented by the integer 4). The key element appears to be identifying a specific color in the input and using it to fill the entire output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cells: pixels with integer values (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)

actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    description: Determine a specific color from the input grid. In this example the color is yellow (4).
  - name: fill_grid
    description: Replaces all pixels in the input grid with the target color to generate output

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains a variety of colored pixels.
  - output_grid: Contains only one color and the dimensions match the input
  - target_color:  Is present in the input, and becomes the only color present in the output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Find the color yellow (represented by the integer 4) within the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Fill Output Grid:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the target color (yellow/4).

Essentially, the transformation replaces all colors in the input grid with yellow (4).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
