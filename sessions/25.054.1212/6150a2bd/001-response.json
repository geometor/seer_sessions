Each number can be associated with a color, as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`. The transformation appears to involve a rotation or mirroring of the grid elements. The colors/numbers are preserved, but their positions change.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This means the element in the top-left corner of the input becomes the bottom-right corner of the output, the top-center becomes the bottom-center, the top-right becomes the bottom-left, and so on. The operation swaps the position of the element at i,j index location with (n-1-i, m-1-j) where n and m represents total rows and columns.\n\nAnother equivalent interpretation of the program can be mirroring the grid, where the process would mirror on vertical axis and horizontal axis.\n"
