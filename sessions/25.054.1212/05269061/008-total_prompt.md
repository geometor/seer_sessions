## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 1 2 4
0 0 0 1 2 4 0
0 0 1 2 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7BFC44366260>

**output:**
```
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid consists of a diagonal line of increasing numbers (1, 2, 4) moving from the top-right towards the bottom-left. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s (white). The output grid has a repeating checkerboard-like pattern using only the numbers 1, 2, and 4, with the noticeable absence of 0.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains a diagonal sequence of numbers 1, 2, and 4.
  - property: The sequence starts at the top-right and extends downwards and to the left.
  - property: All other cells in the input are 0.
  - observation: Output grid is filled with a repeating pattern of 1, 2, and 4.
  - property: The pattern resembles a checkerboard.
  - property: The output grid contains no 0 values.
  - relationship: output grid dimensions are identical to the input
  - relationship: input values 1,2,4 are preserved, 0 is replaced

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.

2.  **Pattern Replacement:** Traverse the output grid cell by cell. Replace every 0 in the input with a repeating sequence, and keep the existing values of 1,2,4. The sequence follows a simple rule that depends on the sum of row index and column index

3.  **Fill:** If cell in the input is 0.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is even, and previous value was 1, next is 2.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is even, and previous value was 2, next is 4.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is even, and previous value was 4, next is 1.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, and previous value was 1, next is 2.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, and previous value was 2, next is 4.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, and previous value was 4, next is 1.
4. If cell value in input is 1, 2, or 4, copy the value to output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
