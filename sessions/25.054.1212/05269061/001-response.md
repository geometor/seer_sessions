Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a smaller set of "active" pixels with non-zero values, while the output grid is completely filled with a repeating pattern derived from those active pixels. The colors/numbers involved seem to be limited to 2 (red), 8 (azure), 3 (green), and 0 (white). The spatial relationship between the initial non-zero pixels seems crucial to the generated pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid contains a 7x7 matrix of pixels."
  - observation: "Output grid contains a 7x7 matrix of pixels."
  - observation: "Input grid has a 3x3 block of non-zero pixels in the top-left corner, rest are zero."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixel values are 2, 8, and 3."
  - observation: "Output grid is filled completely with 2, 8, and 3."
  - relationship: "Output pattern is an expansion of the input's non-zero region."
  - action: "Input pattern is repeated and mirrored to fill output."
  - property: "The input pattern has a width and height, which are the same as the output grid, giving the dimensions."
  - property_input_object: '`input_object` is a 2-d list of integers representing the color of each cell'
  - property_output_object: '`output_object` is a 2-d list of integers representing the color of each cell'

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the core pattern:** Locate the smallest square block of non-zero pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid. In this case, it's the 3x3 block defined by colors 2, 8, and 3.

2. **Determine the seed / core pattern** The dimension of the square that has non-zero colors is the basis of the output grid.

3.  **Replicate and Mirror:** The output is created using the core pattern by repeating the colors of the pattern to fill the grid. Specifically:

    *   The core pattern is repeated in the x dimension by alternating the values, the first three columns use the colors of the seed.
    * The next three columns use the colors in reverse order, columns 4, 5, and 6 reverse the seed pattern.
    * Column 7 is then the same colors as the seed pattern.

4.  **Fill the Grid:** Using the mirrored core pattern, replicate the entire seed pattern.

    * Rows are created by extending the pattern
    * the pattern is repeated and mirrored in the y direction.

In essence, the transformation takes a small, defined pattern and uses it as a tile, then creates mirrored instances, filling the entire output grid.
