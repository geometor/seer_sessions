The input grid appears to have a pattern of non-zero colored pixels (azure, green, yellow, and white) arranged diagonally, surrounded by black (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a repeating pattern derived from the input, filling the entire grid, and only consisting of azure, green and yellow.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The rest of the pixels are black (0).\n  - object_identification: |\n      The primary objects are individual pixels, identifiable by their color (integer value).\n  - input_pattern: |\n       The input contains contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color arranged diagonally.\n  - spatial_relationship: |\n      The colored pixels in the input are diagonally adjacent. Black pixels surround the diagonal.\n  - output_pattern: |\n      The output grid is completely filled with a repeating three-color sequence: yellow(4), azure(8), green(3). These colors appear in the original image and repeat horizontally and vertically in the output\n  - transformation_type: Pattern replacement/replication\n  - dimensions: Input dimensions are 7x7.
