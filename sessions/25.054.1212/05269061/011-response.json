            "text": "Okay, here's an assessment of the provided information, a strategy for resolving errors, and updated documentation:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial strategy of identifying non-zero sequences and extending them to fill zero-valued pixels has fundamental flaws when applied to the broader set of examples. The current approach incorrectly assumes:\n\n1.  **Simple Linear Extension:** It assumes a simple linear continuation of the closest sequence. This fails when the pattern isn't a direct continuation, but rather a mirrored or repeating pattern across the entire grid. The code's local approach doesn't capture the global pattern. The core issue is extending from nearest rather than identifying global.\n2.  **Closest Sequence Selection:** The code always extends from the *closest* sequence, regardless of the overall grid pattern.  This is incorrect; it should identify *all* non-zero sequences and find a repeating sub-pattern within them.\n3. Direction: does not consider direction of pattern.\n4. Input contains multiple sequences and how they interact.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors must shift from local extension to global pattern identification.  Here's the revised approach:\n\n1.  **Identify *All* Non-Zero Sequences:**  The code correctly identifies horizontal and vertical sequences of non-zero pixels. We need to preserve this.\n2.  **Global Pattern Discovery:** Instead of extending the closest sequence, we must analyze *all* identified sequences to find a repeating sub-pattern. This sub-pattern is the key to filling the entire grid.\n3. **Pattern Repetition:** Once the sub-pattern is found, we repeat it across the entire output grid, effectively \"tiling\" the output.\n4. Use all of the input, do not try to find \"closest\".\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution for Reports)**\n\nI'll use the `code_execution` tool to provide precise details on the identified sequences and the nature of the repeating patterns. This will help build a more accurate natural language program.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_sequences(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies sequences of non-zero pixels in the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    sequences = []\n\n    # Horizontal sequences\n    for r in range(rows):\n        current_sequence = []\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                current_sequence.append((r, c, input_grid[r, c]))\n            elif current_sequence:\n                sequences.append(current_sequence)\n                current_sequence = []\n        if current_sequence:  # Handle sequences at the end of rows\n            sequences.append(current_sequence)\n\n    # Vertical sequences\n    for c in range(cols):\n        current_sequence = []\n        for r in range(rows):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:\n                current_sequence.append((r, c, input_grid[r, c]))\n            elif current_sequence:\n                sequences.append(current_sequence)\n                current_sequence = []\n        if current_sequence: # Handle sequences at the end of columns.\n            sequences.append(current_sequence)\n    return sequences\n\ndef analyze_sequences(sequences):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes a list of sequences to find potential repeating patterns.\"\"\"\n    if not sequences:\n        return None\n\n    # Flatten the sequences into a single list of values, preserving order\n    flat_sequence = [val for seq in sequences for _, _, val in seq]\n\n    # Find the shortest repeating subsequence\n    for length in range(1, len(flat_sequence) // 2 + 1):\n        subsequence = flat_sequence[:length]\n        if len(flat_sequence) % length == 0:  # Check if subsequence divides the whole sequence\n             repeats = len(flat_sequence) // length\n             if flat_sequence == subsequence * repeats:\n                return subsequence  # found a repeat\n    return flat_sequence\n\ndef report(input_grid, expected_output):\n\n    sequences = get_sequences(input_grid)\n    repeating_subsequence = analyze_sequences(sequences)\n\n    print(f\"Input Grid:\\n{input_grid}\")\n    print(f\"Expected Output:\\n{expected_output}\")\n    print(f\"Identified Sequences: {sequences}\")\n\n    if repeating_subsequence:\n      print(f\"Repeating Subsequence: {repeating_subsequence}\")\n      \n      #build output based on repeating sequence\n      rows, cols = expected_output.shape\n      sub_len = len(repeating_subsequence)\n      output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n      \n      for r in range(rows):\n          for c in range(cols):\n              index = (r + c) % sub_len\n              output_grid[r,c] = repeating_subsequence[index]\n      print(f\"Generated Output From Sequence:\\n{output_grid}\")\n    else:\n       print(\"No repeating subsequence found.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Example usage with the provided training data\n\nexample_inputs = [\n    np.array([[2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),\n    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2],\n              [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4],\n              [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 0],\n              [0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 0, 0]]),\n    np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n              [8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n              [3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n              [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]])\n]\n\nexample_outputs = [\n    np.array([[2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 2],\n              [8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 2, 8],\n              [3, 2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3],\n              [2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 2],\n              [8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 2, 8],\n              [3, 2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3],\n              [2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 2]]),\n    np.array([[2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2],\n              [4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4],\n              [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1],\n              [2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2],\n              [4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4],\n              [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1],\n              [2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2]]),\n    np.array([[4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4],\n              [8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4, 8],\n              [3, 4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3],\n              [4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4],\n              [8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4, 8],\n              [3, 4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3],\n              [4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4]])\n]\nfor i in range(len(example_inputs)):\n  report(example_inputs[i], example_outputs[i])\n```"
