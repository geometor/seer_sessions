The input grid appears to have a smaller set of \"active\" pixels with non-zero values, while the output grid is completely filled with a repeating pattern derived from those active pixels. The colors/numbers involved seem to be limited to 2 (red), 8 (azure), 3 (green), and 0 (white). The spatial relationship between the initial non-zero pixels seems crucial to the generated pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this case, it's the 3x3 block defined by colors 2, 8, and 3.\n\n2. **Determine the seed / core pattern** The dimension of the square that has non-zero colors is the basis of the output grid.\n\n3.  **Replicate and Mirror:** The output is created using the core pattern by repeating the colors of the pattern to fill the grid. Specifically:\n\n    *   The core pattern is repeated in the x dimension by alternating the values, the first three columns use the colors of the seed.\n    * The next three columns use the colors in reverse order, columns 4, 5, and 6 reverse the seed pattern.\n    * Column 7 is then the same colors as the seed pattern.\n\n4.  **Fill the Grid:** Using the mirrored core pattern, replicate the entire seed pattern.\n\n    * Rows are created by extending the pattern\n    * the pattern is repeated and mirrored in the y direction.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes a small, defined pattern and uses it as a tile, then creates mirrored instances, filling the entire output grid.\n"
