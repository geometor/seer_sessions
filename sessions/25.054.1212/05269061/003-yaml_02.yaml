facts:
  - observation: "The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids."
    type: general
  - observation: "The output grids exhibit a mirrored pattern."
    type: pattern
  - observation: "The pattern appears to be based on a section of the input grid."
    type: pattern
  - observation: "The mirroring occurs both horizontally and vertically."
    type: pattern
  - observation: "In example 1, the top-left 3x3 area of the input shows non-zero values."
    type: input_specific
    example: 1
  - observation: "In example 2, the lower-right 3x3 area of the input shows non-zero values."
    type: input_specific
    example: 2
  - observation: "In example 3, a central 3x3 block of the input shows non-zero values, bordered on two sides by zeros."
    type: input_specific
    example: 3      
  - action: "Identify a repeating pattern within each input grid."
    type: action
  - action: "Mirror the repeating pattern horizontally and vertically to generate the output grid."
    type: action
  - property: "The size of the repeating pattern changes between the input grids"
    type: property
  - property: "Mirrored regions have inverted indexing within the core pattern."
