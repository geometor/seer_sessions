The input grid contains a shape made of red (value 2) pixels and a single yellow (value 4) pixel. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, where the red shape has been replaced with yellow pixels, and the original single yellow pixel is removed. The background (value 0) remains unchanged. The size and position of the red shape remain same after transformation, as does the overall grid size.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
