## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4754A4D0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47549630>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5) pixels. The red pixels remain unchanged. The blue and azure pixels are replaced by gray pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is a 3x3 matrix of pixels, each with a color value.
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color:
            values: [red, blue, azure, gray]
            mapping: {red: 2, blue: 1, azure: 8, gray: 5}
  - transformation:
      - type: color_change
        input: [blue, azure]
        output: gray
        rule: |
          Pixels colored blue or azure are replaced with gray. The location doesn't affect.
  - spatial_relations:
      - type: grid
        description: Pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of each pixel.
3. **If** color is equal to blue(1) or azure(8), change to grey(5).
4.  **Else**, retain the original color.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
