## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 3 8
4 4 4
8 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47584AF0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
4 4 4
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47584490>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels.  The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). There's a noticeable change in the color of certain pixels while others remain the same. The central horizontal row appears to be preserved, and the surrounding pixels all change to a single color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

observations:
  - input_grid:
      row_1: [3, 3, 8]
      row_2: [4, 4, 4]
      row_3: [8, 1, 1]
  - output_grid:
      row_1: [5, 5, 5]
      row_2: [4, 4, 4]
      row_3: [5, 5, 5]

transformations:
  - description: "The middle row is preserved."
    before: [4, 4, 4]
    after:  [4, 4, 4]
  - description: "All other cells changed color."
    before: [[3, 3, 8], [8, 1, 1]]
    after: [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]

relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description: "Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid."
 - type: transformation
   description: "Input grid pixels map to output grid pixels based on their original color and position."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the middle row:** Locate the row at index 1 (the second row) of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the middle row:** Copy the middle row directly to the output grid at the same index (row 1).
3.  **Change surrounding pixels:** Examine the remaining cells in the grid.
      Replace the original color of every cell with the color gray(5).
      Place these grey pixels at the respective locations in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
