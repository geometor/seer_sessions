Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains red (2) and azure (8) pixels. The output grid maintains the red (2) pixels but replaces the azure (8) pixels with gray (5) pixels. The transformation seems to be a simple color replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [2, 8]  # Input grid
          mapping:
            2: red
            8: azure
      - color:
           values: [2, 5] # output grid
           mapping:
             2: red
             5: gray

actions:
  - type: color_replacement
    input_color: 8
    output_color: 5
    scope: all pixels of input_color

relationships:
- type: spatial
  description: "Pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid."
- type: transformation
  description: "Input grid transforms to output grid by replacing all the azure color to gray color, all red color remains as it is."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color azure (8) in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** these azure (8) pixels with gray (5) pixels in the output grid.
3. All red color (2) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
