## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47584AF0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
5 5 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47584DC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains red (2) and azure (8) pixels. The output grid maintains the red (2) pixels but replaces the azure (8) pixels with gray (5) pixels. The transformation seems to be a simple color replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [2, 8]  # Input grid
          mapping:
            2: red
            8: azure
      - color:
           values: [2, 5] # output grid
           mapping:
             2: red
             5: gray

actions:
  - type: color_replacement
    input_color: 8
    output_color: 5
    scope: all pixels of input_color

relationships:
- type: spatial
  description: "Pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid."
- type: transformation
  description: "Input grid transforms to output grid by replacing all the azure color to gray color, all red color remains as it is."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color azure (8) in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** these azure (8) pixels with gray (5) pixels in the output grid.
3. All red color (2) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
