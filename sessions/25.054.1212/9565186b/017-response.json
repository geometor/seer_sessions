            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting Python code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the replacement of azure (8) with gray (5), it failed to account for the context of the surrounding pixels. The code currently replaces *all* instances of 8 with 5, regardless of their position or relationship to other colors. The errors show that the transformation is positionally and relationally dependent, and is only a simple global color substitution in a specific case (example 3). We need to carefully examine the relationship between input and output grids to derive a more complex rule if needed. The varying results highlight the necessity for iterative refinement. The program works for example 3, but failed on others.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** I will meticulously compare the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example where they don't match. This will involve looking at the specific pixels that are incorrect.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** The key is to determine *why* certain 8s are replaced and others aren't. I will look for patterns and relationships in the mismatched examples. Is it based on adjacency? Position relative to edges? The overall shape formed by color blocks.\n3. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on a deeper analysis I will go back to the input and output grids for all examples and develop a hypothesis for a new program.\n4.  **Fact Yaml:** I will develop a YAML that will incorporate observations across all the training data examples and summarize properties, actions, and relationships between objects that may be relevant.\n\n**Metrics and Reports (using provided results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 1. The second 1 in input was not changed to 5 as expected.\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 3. The last two 5's should be 2 and 3\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: True\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels off: 4\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: False\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: False\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  -

Examine the Input Grid.\n2.  Locate all pixels with the value of 8 (azure), 3 (green) or 1 (blue).\n3.  Change any pixel of color 8 (azure), 1 (blue), or 3 (green) to the color 5 (gray).\n4.  Leave pixels of all colors other than 8, 1, and 3 unchanged.\n\n"
