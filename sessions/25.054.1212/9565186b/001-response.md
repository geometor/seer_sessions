Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5) pixels. The red pixels remain unchanged. The blue and azure pixels are replaced by gray pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is a 3x3 matrix of pixels, each with a color value.
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color:
            values: [red, blue, azure, gray]
            mapping: {red: 2, blue: 1, azure: 8, gray: 5}
  - transformation:
      - type: color_change
        input: [blue, azure]
        output: gray
        rule: |
          Pixels colored blue or azure are replaced with gray. The location doesn't affect.
  - spatial_relations:
      - type: grid
        description: Pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of each pixel.
3. **If** color is equal to blue(1) or azure(8), change to grey(5).
4.  **Else**, retain the original color.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.
