            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were too simplistic, focusing primarily on moving specific colored pixels (azure and red) to predefined locations. The results demonstrate that this approach fails to generalize across the training examples. The core issue is a lack of understanding of relative positioning and conditional transformations based on the arrangement of objects within the input grid. The code isn't really moving objects, rather it is moving individual pixels and thus, it is breaking apart the objects.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object-Based Thinking:** Shift from thinking about individual pixels to thinking about \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color).\n2.  **Relative Positioning:** Instead of fixed positions, determine the target positions of objects *relative* to other objects or the grid boundaries.\n3.  **Conditional Logic:** Incorporate conditions based on object properties (e.g., adjacency, size, shape) to determine how they should be moved or transformed.\n4. Focus on preserving the integrity of objects.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Match | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                                       |\n| :-----: | :---------: | :----------: | :---: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n|    1    |   (3, 3)    |   (3, 3)    | False |     2      | Incorrectly moved '3' (green).  It should consider gray and other colors, not just 8 and 2.     |\n|    2    |   (4, 4)    |   (4, 4)    | False |     6      | Fails to move '6'(magenta) correctly and doesn't handle the adjacency of magenta pixels.    |\n|    3    |   (5, 5)    |   (5, 5)    | False |     7      | Incorrect placement of the moved object, misinterpreting how objects should be positioned. |\n\n**YAML Fact Gathering:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - color: 5  # gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (0, 0)\n    - color: 3  # green\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (1, 0)\n    - color: 5 #gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial position: (1,1)\n    - color: 5 #gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial position: (2,2)\n  transformations:\n    - move: all existing pixels\n      condition:\n        - \"all pixels remain in their original positions\"\n      action: \"no change\"\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - color: 5  # gray\n      shape: two L shaped objects\n      initial_position: [(0,0),(1,1)] #top left\n    - color: 6  # magenta\n      shape: vertical line of two pixels\n      initial_position: [(2, 0), (3, 0)]\n    - color: 4 #yellow\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial position: (3,2)\n    - color: 5 # gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial position: (3,3)\n  transformations:\n     - move: 6 #magenta\n       condition: \n         - \"vertical line of two pixels in top left\"\n       action: \"move two the top row, two leftmost columns, maintaining shape\"\n     - move: \"all other pixels\"\n       condition:\n         - \"no change\"\n       action: \"retain initial position\"\nexample_3:\n  objects:\n    - color: 5  # gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (0, 0)\n    - color: 5 #gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (1,1)\n    - color: 8  # azure\n      shape: horizontal line of two pixels\n      initial_position: [(2, 0), (2, 1)]\n    - color: 5 #gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (2,2)\n    - color: 2  # red\n      shape: vertical line of two pixels\n      initial_position: [(3, 1), (4, 1)]\n    - color: 1  # blue\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (4,3)\n    - color: 5 #gray\n      shape: single pixel\n      initial_position: (3,4)\n  transformations:\n    - move: object with color 8\n      new_position: top row, starting at third column\n    - move: object with color 2, directly to the right of color 8\n    - all other colors: move down one row.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.\n2. **Top Row Object Identification:** Locate the object(s) containing azure (8) pixels. If found, move the entire azure object to the top row, positioning its leftmost pixel in the third column (index 2). Other positions of this object are determined by the positions relative to this leftmost pixel.\n3.  **Second Top Row Placement**: Locate the object(s) containing red (2) pixels. If found, move the red object to the top row, positioning its leftmost pixel adjacent to the rightmost pixel of the azure object. Other positions of this object are determined by the positions relative to this leftmost pixel.\n4. **Conditional Shift:** If an object does not have color 8 or 2, then move down by one row.\n5. **Preservation:** Pixels not part of moved objects shift down by exactly one row.\n\n"
