Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.
2. **Top Row Object Identification:** Locate the object(s) containing azure (8) pixels. If found, move the entire azure object to the top row, positioning its leftmost pixel in the third column (index 2). Other positions of this object are determined by the positions relative to this leftmost pixel.
3.  **Second Top Row Placement**: Locate the object(s) containing red (2) pixels. If found, move the red object to the top row, positioning its leftmost pixel adjacent to the rightmost pixel of the azure object. Other positions of this object are determined by the positions relative to this leftmost pixel.
4. **Conditional Shift:** If an object does not have color 8 or 2, then move down by one row.
5. **Preservation:** Pixels not part of moved objects shift down by exactly one row.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. It focused heavily on moving specific colored objects (azure and red) to the top row and shifting everything else down by one. This approach works for some cases but fails to capture the underlying logic, especially when azure and red objects are absent or when other objects interact in more complex ways. The results highlight that the one-row shift and the specific object movement are not universally applicable rules. The core issue is an incorrect generalization from the first training example. We need to re-evaluate the assumptions and focus on the true relationships between input and output.

Strategy:

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Thoroughly analyze *all* provided examples. Pay close attention to *all* objects, not just azure and red. Look for patterns in how *all* objects change position, size, and color.
2.  **Object-Centric Approach:** Maintain the object-centric approach (identifying contiguous blocks of the same color), but be more flexible about how we define "object interaction."
3.  **Relative Positioning:** Focus more on the relative positions of objects before and after the transformation. Instead of just "move to top," think about "object X is now *above/below/left-of/right-of* object Y".
4.  **Conditional Logic:** Look for conditions. Are some transformations dependent on the presence/absence of certain colors, object sizes, or relative positions?
5. **Disregard Shift Assumption:** Drop the idea of a universal one-row downward shift, as it's clearly incorrect. Focus on what's happening locally around objects, instead of assuming a global shift.

**Metrics and Observations (using code for precise counts):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Preserve Diagonal:** If there is a gray (5) object in a diagonal line starting from the top-left, maintain its starting position.
3.  **Move Color Objects:** If there is azure (8) object, place to row 0. Place its leftmost pixel at column index 2. If there is red (2) object, place it to the right of azure object, on the same row.
4.  **Move Magenta:** If there is magenta (6) object, stack all pixels on top row starting from column index 2.
5. **Gray Fills:** If gray object is present and is split, the lowest and rightmost pixel of the object, will move to the left, staying on its row, occupying next empty cell, only if no same color pixel is present.
6.  **Fill Gaps:** Other color (0/white) objects fill empty spaces left by the movement of the objects above.

This revised natural language program takes into account more observations from all three examples. It addresses the limitations of the previous version by:

*   Moving away from a fixed "shift down" rule.
*   Handling objects that contains color (8) and (2)
*   Handling objects color (6)
*   Considering object placement based on others.
*   Adding gap-filling as a general rule for object of color (0).

This program is still likely incomplete, but it represents a significant improvement in understanding the transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
