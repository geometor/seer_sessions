            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, focusing only on swapping pixels at (0, 0) and (0, 1) if they are not white. The provided examples demonstrate a more complex diagonal pattern replacement. The strategy should involve identifying this diagonal pattern and correctly translating/rotating columns based on color matching in the first row.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Examine the `pixels_off` and visual differences between \"Transformed Output\" and \"Expected Output\" to understand the nature of the transformation. The images will be very helpful in recognizing the shifting and rotating.\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** Formulate a hypothesis about the rule governing the transformation that is not limited to the first two pixels. Look for diagonal structures.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to describe the more general diagonal object transformation.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Observation: The '3' and '5' in the top-left 2x2 subgrid appear to have swapped, but this is too specific. The key is the diagonal. The first column became the main diagonal. The 5 at 0,0 moves to 0,0. The 3 at 1,0 moves to 1,1. the 0 at 2,0 moves to 2,2.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 4x4\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *   Observation: The first column is now the main diagonal.\n        - Column 0 becomes main diagonal: (0,0)->(0,0), (1,0)->(1,1), (2,0)->(2,2), (3,0) -> (3,3). The remaining columns shift left, wrapping.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Pixels Off: 10\n    *   Observation: Same pattern. First column to main diagonal and columns shift/wrap left.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: 002\n  - objects:\n      - description: grid of colored pixels\n      - properties:\n          - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All possible colors\n          - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)\n  - actions:\n      - description: Transform the grid based on its first column and top row.\n      - details:\n          - step_1: \"The first column becomes the main diagonal of the output.\"\n          - step_2: \"The other columns are placed to the left of the current column, rotated downwards and wrapped if necessary.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Diagonalization of First Column:** The first column of the input grid becomes the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) of the output grid.\n\n2.  **Column Shift and Wrap:** For each subsequent column in the input grid (starting from the second column), it is placed to the *left* of where it was in the input grid. The column indices rotate and wrap-around. The columns are copied unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the first column sets the main diagonal, and the other columns are shifted/rotated based on their horizontal position relative to the original location.\n"
