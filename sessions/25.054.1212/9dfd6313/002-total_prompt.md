## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 0 0
3 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48908D00>

**output:**
```
5 3 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids seems to be the arrangement or values of non-zero pixels, while zero-value (white) pixels act almost like a background. The non-zero values appear to shift positions. Specifically the green pixel with `3` seems to have moved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: color
        values: [0, 3, 5]  # Based on the provided example
      - name: position
        values: [(row, col) for row in range(3) for col in range(3)]

actions:
  - name: move_pixel
    description: Changes the position of a non-zero pixel within the grid.
    preconditions:
      - pixel_value != 0
    postconditions:
      - pixel_position_new != pixel_position_old

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Describes the spatial relationship between pixels (up, down, left, right, diagonals).
  - type: contains
    description: The grid contains pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with values other than 0.
2.  **Swap Trigger:** If a non-zero value exists on row 1, column 0, swap places with a non-zero value, if present on row 1, column 1.
3. All other pixels remain in their original position.

In summary the transformation is a conditional swap between the value at \[0,0] and the value at \[0,1], if these values are non-zero.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
