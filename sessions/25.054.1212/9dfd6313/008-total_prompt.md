## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 0 0 0
0 5 0 0
6 0 5 0
6 0 4 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC475039D0>

**output:**
```
5 0 6 6
0 5 0 0
0 0 5 4
0 0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC47502170>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 4x4 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of some, but not all, of the colored pixels.  The white pixels (0) appear to act like a background or empty space, and the non-zero pixels are the primary actors. There's a definite spatial/geometric aspect to the transformation, as the positions of the colored pixels change. The input and output grids have different arrangements.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: colored_pixel
    property: color (represented by integer value)
    property: position (row, column)
    action: move (change position)
  - object: white_pixel
    property: color (0)
    property: position (row, column)
    action: none (remains stationary, acts as background)
  - relationship: spatial_rearrangement
    description: colored pixels change positions based on an unknown rule.
  - observation:
    description: Not all colored pixels move, certain color pixels are moved to a different position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Pixels:** Locate all pixels with values other than 0 (white) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Movement Rule**: The gray (5) pixels remain in the same place. The magenta (6) pixels move to the top right corner. The order of the 6's are preserved by column, then by row. The yellow(4) pixel moved to the location above the bottom right 5.
3.  **Rearrange:** Create the output grid by placing each identified pixel to the location prescribed by step 2.
4. Fill the remaining locations with 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
