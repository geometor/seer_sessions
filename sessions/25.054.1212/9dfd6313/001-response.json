The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids seems to be the arrangement or values of non-zero pixels, while zero-value (white) pixels act almost like a background. The non-zero values appear to shift positions. Specifically the green pixel with `3` seems to have moved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
