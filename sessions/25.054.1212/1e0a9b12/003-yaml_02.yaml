task_id: 002
observations:
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      value: [0-9]  # Represents color
      position: [row, column]
    behavior:
      - move_to_bottom: Non-zero pixels move to the lowest available row.
      - preserve_order_rowwise: Non-zero pixels maintain their original left-to-right order within each row.
      - fill_with_zeros: Zero-valued pixels remain, or fill empty spaces.
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns] #same for input and output
    behavior:
        - transformation: "The grid is transformed based on pixel behaviors"
