## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x640 at 0x7BFC47F93430>

**output:**
```
8 1 8
1 8 8
8 1 8
8 8 1
8 1 8

1 8 8
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains mostly '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel near the bottom left. The output grid seems to "replace" all '0' values based on a pattern related to distance from the original '1' pixel. The '1' pixel itself appears to remain unchanged in position, however, the surrounding pixels alternate between '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) and the overall appearance of the grid resembles a checkerboard, centered around the original single blue pixel.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x3 (rows x columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (representing color)
      - position: (row, column)
  - observation: single_blue_pixel
    details: The input grid contains one pixel with value '1'.
  - observation: output_pattern
    details: The output grid replaces '0's with a checkerboard pattern of '8' and '1' values, seemingly radiating from the location of the original single blue pixel, and includes its original position.
  - action: transformation
    type: grid-to-grid
    details: Modifies pixel values based on their original value and position relative to the initial '1' pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the '1' Pixel:** Find the (row, column) coordinates of the single pixel with a value of '1' in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve the '1':** Copy input grid to output grid to keep the original '1' pixel in the output grid.

3.  **Create Checkerboard Pattern:** Iterate through every other cell in the output grid:
    *   If a pixel's original value in the input grid was '0', fill the cells with a checkered pattern of '1' and '8'.
    *   Pixels with the same parity as the original '1' pixel in both row and column are set to '8'.
    *   Otherwise they are '1'.

4. The result is a checkered board of '8' and '1' pixels, where all original '0's in the input grid are replaced.

In summary: find the '1' pixel, and replace the '0' pixels, producing a checkerboard pattern centered on the original '1' pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
