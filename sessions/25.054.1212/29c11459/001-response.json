The primary observation is the change in the second row. In the input, there's a blue pixel (1) on the left and a red pixel (2) on the right, with white pixels (0) in between. In the output, the blue and red pixels remain, but all the white pixels between them are replaced. The blue pixels extend to the center and connect at a grey (5) pixel. The Red pixels are on the other side of the grey pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
