The input grid contains a row with two distinct non-zero values (3 and 7, representing green and orange respectively) at opposite ends, with zeros in between. The output grid transforms this row. The non-zero values in the input are expanded towards the center in the output. A new value of 5 (grey) appears in the middle, separating the two expanded original colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
