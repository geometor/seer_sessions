## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x320 at 0x7BFC47584A00>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a numerical value (0-9) corresponding to a color. The primary observation is the change in the second row. In the input, there's a blue pixel (1) on the left and a red pixel (2) on the right, with white pixels (0) in between. In the output, the blue and red pixels remain, but all the white pixels between them are replaced. The blue pixels extend to the center and connect at a grey (5) pixel. The Red pixels are on the other side of the grey pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x11 (height x width)
      pixels: [0-9]  # Numerical values representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue
          2: red
          5: grey
      position: (row, column)

  - type: horizontal_segment
    properties:
        start_pixel:
            color: blue
            position: (1,0)
        end_pixel:
            color: red
            position: (1,10)
        changed: True #flag to check if the horizontal segment has changed from input to output
actions:
  - name: fill_between
    description: Replace white pixels (0) between the blue and red pixels on the same row.
    parameters:
      start_color: 1
      end_color: 2
      row: 1
      connect_color: 5
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally).
  - type: between
    description: The set of white pixels horizontally between the blue and red pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Row:** Find the row (in this case, row 1) containing both a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2).
2.  **Locate Start and End:** Identify the column indices of the blue pixel (start) and the red pixel (end) on that row.
3.  **Connect with a line:** Connect the blue pixel to the center, connect the end pixel to the center
4.  **Connect at center**: Add a pixel of color grey at the center.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
