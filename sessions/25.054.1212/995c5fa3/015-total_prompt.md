1. **Scan the Input:** Examine the input grid and identify the columns that contain white (0) pixels.
2. **Column-to-Row Mapping:**  For each identified column containing white, map it to a corresponding row in the output grid:
    - The first column with a white pixel corresponds to output row 1.
    - The second column with a white pixel corresponds to output row 2.
    - The third column with a white pixel corresponds to output row 3.
3. **Assign Colors:** Assign a specific color to each output row based on a predefined mapping:
    - Row 1: Azure (8)
    - Row 2: Red (2)
    - Row 3: Yellow (4)
4. **Create Output:** Construct a 3x3 output grid. Fill all cells in each row of output with mapped color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
