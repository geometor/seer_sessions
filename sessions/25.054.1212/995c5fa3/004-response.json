            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided data and results to understand the transformation and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code clearly wasn't designed to solve the problem, since it provided transformed outputs that don't match and weren't analyzed at all. It serves as a framework, but it's only useful now for providing the `analyze_results` function. The core logic needs to be completely derived. The examples show a consistent input pattern: a 14x4 grid with a repeated structure involving gray (5) and white (0) pixels.  The outputs are 3x3 grids with varying colors, and do not match at all to the provided `transformed` arrays. The challenge is to relate the specific arrangement of 0s and 5s in the input to the color and arrangement in the *expected* output. It seems probable that the positions of white (0) pixels in a certain region of the input determine the output colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on `expected` output**: Ignore `transformed` output provided in the examples, they are not correct.\n\n2.  **Object Identification:** Treat sections of the input grid delineated by the white (0) pixels as potential objects or regions of interest. The consistent 14x4 input size and the placement of 0's suggest a deliberate division of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Positional Mapping:** Explore the hypothesis that the *position* of white pixels within these regions dictates the color in the output grid.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a simple hypothesis (e.g., the first white pixel's location determines the first output pixel's color) and test it against all examples.  Refine the hypothesis based on discrepancies.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using `analyze_results` function as a template):**\n\nI'll re-execute the `analyze_results` function but first I am going to modify it to print out the inputs and expected outputs in a way that makes it easier to visualize and to remove the `transformed` input as it's useless.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)\n\n    print(f\"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"Expected output shape: {expected_output.shape}\")\n\n    print(\"Input grid:\")\n    print(input_grid)\n    print(\"Expected output grid:\")\n    print(expected_output)\n\n# Example Data (replace with actual data from each example)\nexamples = [\n    {\n      \"input\": [\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n      ],\n      \"expected\": [\n            [2, 2, 2],\n            [8, 8, 8],\n            [3, 3, 3]\n      ]\n    },\n     {\n      \"input\": [\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n      ],\n      \"expected\": [\n            [3, 3, 3],\n            [4, 4, 4],\n            [2, 2, 2]\n      ]\n\n    },\n    {\n      \"input\":[\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]\n      ],\n      \"expected\":[\n            [8, 8, 8],\n            [2, 2, 2],\n            [4, 4, 4]\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n            [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n        ],\n        \"expected\":[\n            [2, 2, 2],\n            [4, 4, 4],\n            [2, 2, 2]\n          ]\n    }\n\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    print(f\"\\n--- Example {i + 1} ---\")\n    analyze_results(example[\"input\"], example[\"expected\"])\n```"
