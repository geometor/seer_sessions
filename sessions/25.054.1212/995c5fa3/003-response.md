Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying vertical white stripes and mapping their lengths to colors in a 3x3 grid was partially correct. However, there are several key errors:

1.  **Incorrect Color Mapping:** The `color_map` is incomplete and doesn't handle all observed lengths. Example 2 reveals a mapping for a length of 4. Example 1 and 3 had lengths of 2, but the assigned color should have been 8.
2.  **Column-Wise Processing, not strict order:** The code appears to scan for vertical stripes of white, and then process *columns* from left-to-right based on the lengths. The color of each 3x3 output pixel is based on the vertical stripe in the corresponding *column* of the input - if there is one. If the column does not have any white stripes, a 0 (black) pixel appears in the output.
3.  **Missing Colors in output:** the expected output can contain a 4 (yellow) but
    the results from the existing code do not reflect this.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine the Color Map:** Analyze all examples to create a complete and accurate `color_map` that covers all observed stripe lengths and their corresponding colors.
2.  **Enforce Column-wise processing, with default:** Ensure we are looking at each column. If no stripe is present, the output pixel defaults to black (0)

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)

    print(f"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Expected output shape: {expected_output.shape}")
    print(f"Transformed output shape: {transformed_output.shape}")

    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, transformed_output)
    print(f"Match: {match}")

    if not match:
        pixels_off = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
        print(f"Pixels off: {pixels_off}")

        unique_expected, counts_expected = np.unique(expected_output, return_counts=True)
        unique_transformed, counts_transformed = np.unique(transformed_output, return_counts=True)

        print("Expected Pixel Counts:", dict(zip(unique_expected, counts_expected)))
        print("Transformed Pixel Counts:", dict(zip(unique_transformed, counts_transformed)))

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through Columns:** Examine each column of the input grid, from left to right (columns 0, 1, and 2 only).

2.  **Identify White Stripes:** Within each examined column, find vertical "stripes" of white (0) pixels. A stripe is one or more contiguous white pixels.

3.  **Measure Stripe Length:** If a white stripe is found in the current column, determine its length (the number of contiguous white pixels).

4.  **Map Length to Color:** Use the following mapping to determine the output color based on the stripe length:

    *   Length 1: Red (2)
    *   Length 2: Azure (8)
    *   Length 3: Green (3)
    *   Length 4: Yellow (4)

5.  **Fill Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.  For each column (0, 1, and 2) in the input grid, find the *first* white stripe and set the corresponding column of the *entire* output grid to the mapped color from step 4. If no stripe is in the examined input grid column, the corresponding output column defaults to black (0).

6. Skip any additional columns in the input grid.
