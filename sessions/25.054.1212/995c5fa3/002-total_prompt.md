## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC44391180>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 8
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44393E80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The input appears to be a grid of pixels, primarily gray (5) with some white (0) pixels. The output is a smaller grid with seemingly arbitrary colors (2, 8, 3). The output grid is significantly smaller (3x3) than the input grid (4x14). It appears the white pixels (0) in input are somehow influencing selection of position and the final color. It also looks like some type of object detection and counting will inform the creation of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a grid of 4x14 pixels, with values representing colors.
      The dominant color is gray (5) and it has some white color(0) pixels.
  - object: |
        White (0) pixel cluster appear in the input grid.
  - properties:
      - input_grid_size: 4 x 14
      - output_grid_size: 3 x 3
      - input_colors: [5, 0]
      - output_colors: [2, 8, 3]
  - action: The output grid is generated based on the input grid and its white areas
  - relationships:
      -  The white pixels form vertical lines or "stripes".
      -   Each stripe has a specific length. The length range from 1 to 4.
      -  The output is always 3x3.
      - output color doesn't reflect any input colors
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify White Stripes:** Locate vertical columns in the input grid that contain white (0) pixels. A "stripe" is defined as one or more adjacent white pixels in a column.
2.  **Measure Stripe Lengths:** For each identified white stripe, determine its length (the number of continuous white pixels).
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. There may be a one to one mapping of lengths to color values.
4.   **Fill the Output Grid:**
    *   Iterate through the first three white stripe lengths identified in step 1 and 2
    * Assign colors to each cell in the output grid from top to bottom, left to right:
        *   If the length is 1, assign Red (2).
        *   If the length is 2, assign Azure (8).
        *   If the length is 3, assign Green (3).
        *   If the length is 4, assign ? (unknown)

The core concept is that the lengths of vertical "stripes" of white pixels in the input grid determine the colors in the output grid. The output is always a 3x3 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
