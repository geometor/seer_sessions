The output is a 3x3 grid containing red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. The output seems to be extracting and transforming a very specific feature from a larger image.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider the position of the central square *relative to* the vertical lines.\n3. **Create output:** Create an output grid of size 3x3\n4. **Determine central pixel and its color:** From the input grid we find that the central square is surrounded on four sides by the gray color '5'. Since the columns of the vertical lines are 5 and 10 and the central square occupies column 7 and 8, there are 2 columns of color 5 between vertical lines and central square. Replace '5' with '4'\n5. **Encode Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill the center row with the new color, here '4' for yellow. The top and bottom rows are color '2' for red.\n\nThe core idea seems to be that a central feature from the input, defined both by the central location and lines of '0',  is extracted and then used to construct the 3x3 output. The surrounding columns determines the central row of the output.\n"
