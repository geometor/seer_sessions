The output is a smaller grid with seemingly arbitrary colors (2, 8, 3). The output grid is significantly smaller (3x3) than the input grid (4x14). It appears the white pixels (0) in input are somehow influencing selection of position and the final color. It also looks like some type of object detection and counting will inform the creation of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A \"stripe\" is defined as one or more adjacent white pixels in a column.\n2.  **Measure Stripe Lengths:** For each identified white stripe, determine its length (the number of continuous white pixels).\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. There may be a one to one mapping of lengths to color values.\n4.   **Fill the Output Grid:**\n    *   Iterate through the first three white stripe lengths identified in step 1 and 2\n    * Assign colors to each cell in the output grid from top to bottom, left to right:\n        *   If the length is 1, assign Red (2).\n        *   If the length is 2, assign Azure (8).\n        *   If the length is 3, assign Green (3).\n        *   If the length is 4, assign ? (unknown)\n\nThe core concept is that the lengths of vertical \"stripes\" of white pixels in the input grid determine the colors in the output grid. The output is always a 3x3 grid.\n"
