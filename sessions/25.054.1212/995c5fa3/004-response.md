Okay, let's analyze the provided data and results to understand the transformation and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code clearly wasn't designed to solve the problem, since it provided transformed outputs that don't match and weren't analyzed at all. It serves as a framework, but it's only useful now for providing the `analyze_results` function. The core logic needs to be completely derived. The examples show a consistent input pattern: a 14x4 grid with a repeated structure involving gray (5) and white (0) pixels.  The outputs are 3x3 grids with varying colors, and do not match at all to the provided `transformed` arrays. The challenge is to relate the specific arrangement of 0s and 5s in the input to the color and arrangement in the *expected* output. It seems probable that the positions of white (0) pixels in a certain region of the input determine the output colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Focus on `expected` output**: Ignore `transformed` output provided in the examples, they are not correct.

2.  **Object Identification:** Treat sections of the input grid delineated by the white (0) pixels as potential objects or regions of interest. The consistent 14x4 input size and the placement of 0's suggest a deliberate division of the input grid.

3.  **Positional Mapping:** Explore the hypothesis that the *position* of white pixels within these regions dictates the color in the output grid.

4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a simple hypothesis (e.g., the first white pixel's location determines the first output pixel's color) and test it against all examples.  Refine the hypothesis based on discrepancies.

**Metrics and Observations (using `analyze_results` function as a template):**

I'll re-execute the `analyze_results` function but first I am going to modify it to print out the inputs and expected outputs in a way that makes it easier to visualize and to remove the `transformed` input as it's useless.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)

    print(f"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Expected output shape: {expected_output.shape}")

    print("Input grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected output grid:")
    print(expected_output)
