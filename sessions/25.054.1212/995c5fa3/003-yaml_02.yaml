      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors, derived from white stripe lengths

actions:
  - name: identify_stripes
    input: input_grid
    output: list of white_stripes
    description: Locates vertical columns of white pixels in the input grid.

  - name: measure_length
    input: white_stripe
    output: integer
    description: Determines the length of a white stripe.

  - name: map_color
    input: length
    output: color code (integer)
    description: Assigns a color code based on stripe length.

  - name: fill_output
    input: list of color codes, output_grid
    output: output_grid (filled)
    description: Populates the output grid with color codes based on the first three white stripes and their lengths, working column-wise. If no stripe is present in a particular column, the output defaults to black (0)
