"""
1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all blue pixels (value 1) on the first row (row index 0) of the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Propagation:** If any seed pixels are found, change all pixels on the first row to red (value 2), starting from the leftmost seed pixel position, and filling completely the first row.
3.  **Vertical Propagation**: If there is any blue pixel directly below blue seed pixel, changed to red.
4.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels that are not transformed to red above remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
