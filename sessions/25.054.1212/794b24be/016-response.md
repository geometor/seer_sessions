"""
Iterate through each row of the input grid. Within each row, iterate through the pixels from left to right. If a pixel is blue, change it to red in the output grid. If a pixel is white, check if there is a blue or red pixel to its left in the same row, and that pixel occurs before any other non-white colors. If so, change the white pixel to red in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.
