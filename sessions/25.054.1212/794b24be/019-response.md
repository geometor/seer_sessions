Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains 0s (white) and 2s (red). The spatial layout of the 0s is preserved. The key change seems to be a replacement of some non-zero values with a different non-zero value.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
  - object: cell
    type: pixel
    values:
      input: [0, 1]
      output: [0, 2]
  - observation: spatial_layout_of_zeros_preserved: true
  - action: value_replacement
    condition: input_cell_value == 1
    result: output_cell_value == 2
  - relationship:
      input_grid:
        contains: [cell_0, cell_1]
      output_grid:
        contains: [cell_0, cell_2]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Zeros:** Copy all cells with the value 0 (white) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their positions.
2.  **Transform Blues:** If the input grid contains a cell with the value of 1 (blue), it will become 2 (red) in the output grid, and if it contains a cell with any other value, copy it from the input grid to the output grid.
3. Iterate over entire output grid, replacing 1 with 2

In other words all 1 will become 2 and the rest are unchanged.
