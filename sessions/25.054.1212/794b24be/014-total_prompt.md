## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47544220>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid in both the input and output. The input grid contains 0s and 1s, representing white and blue pixels, respectively. The output grid contains 0s and 2s, representing white and red pixels, respectively. The transformation seems to involve a change in color of specific pixels, while others remain unchanged (white pixels). The blue pixels in the input correspond to red pixels in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [white, blue]
    input_values: [0, 1]
    output_colors: [white, red]
    output_values: [0, 2]
  - observation: blue pixels in input become red pixels in output
  - observation: white pixels remain white
  - action: color_change
    source_color: blue
    target_color: red
    source_value: 1
    target_value: 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **If** the pixel is blue (value 1), change it to red (value 2) in the output grid.
3.  **Else**, if the pixel is white (value 0), keep it white (value 0) in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
