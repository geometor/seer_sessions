task: 052
observations:
  - input_objects:
      - description: Blue (1) pixels in varying configurations (single, multiple, adjacent, non-adjacent).
      - property: Act as the starting points for the transformation.
  - output_objects:
      - description: Red (2) pixels replacing and expanding from the original blue pixels.
      - property: Appear in positions that were previously blue, and in adjacent positions.
  - actions:
      - description: Replacement of blue pixels with red pixels.
      - description: Limited horizontal and vertical propagation. The stopping condition for propagation in all directions appears when the edge of the grid or a non-white pixel is encountered. Only 'white' pixels are converted.
  - constraints:
      - description: Transformation originates from blue pixels.
      - description: The output grid size matches the input grid size.
      - description: Propagation only replaces white pixels.
