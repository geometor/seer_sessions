## Example 7

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63DF0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47544E20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid also contains pixels of potentially two colors: white (0) and red (2), but in this specific instance, we only see white and red where previously there was blue. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The transformation seems to involve a color change based on color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        elements: [0, 1] # white, blue
      - name: output_grid
        elements: [0, 2] # white, red

actions:
  - type: color_change
    input: 1 # blue
    output: 2 # red

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grid dimensions are preserved.
  - type: conditional_transformation
    description: Blue pixels in the input become red pixels in the output.  White pixels remain white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Conditional Color Change:**
    *   If a pixel is blue (1), change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel is white (0), keep its color as white (0) in the output grid.
4.  **Output:** Produce the modified 3x3 grid as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
