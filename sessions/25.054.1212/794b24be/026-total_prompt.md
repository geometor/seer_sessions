## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 0 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63DF0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47544E20>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   **Colors/Values:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color.
*   **Change in Color/Value:** A single cell changes its color/value from the input grid to the output grid. All other cells remain unchanged.
*    The input has a blue pixel (1) that changes to a red (2) pixel in the same location in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    description: A 2D array of pixels, each with a color value.

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 1, 2]
        mapping: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red}
      position:
        type: coordinates
        description: (row, column) within the grid

actions:
  - type: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: single pixel
    precondition:
      color: blue (1)
      position: (0,2)
    postcondition:
      color: red (2)
      position: (0,2)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid, with adjacency defined by row and column.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the single blue pixel (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Change:** Change the value of that pixel to red (value 2).
3.  **Preserve:** Keep all other pixels in the grid unchanged.
4.    **Output:** Produce a new grid which is a copy of the input with exception of the located and changed pixel.

Essentially, the rule is to change the blue pixel to red, while leaving the rest of the grid the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
