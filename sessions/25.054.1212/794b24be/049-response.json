The input grid appears to contain values 0 and 1. The corresponding output grid contains values of 0 and 2. The general layout, dimensions and structure appear identical with the cell as the unit of change. The key difference seems to be a change of color of some cells.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
