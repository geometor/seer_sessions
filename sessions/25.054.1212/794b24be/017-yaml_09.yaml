facts:
  - observation: "All input and output grids have the same dimensions."
    type: constraint
    property: dimensions
    values: identical

  - observation: "Input grids contain only white (0) and blue (1) pixels."
    type: constraint
    property: input_colors
    values: [0, 1]

  - observation: "Output grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels."
    type: constraint
    property: output_colors
    values: [0, 2]

  - observation: "Blue (1) pixels in the input always become red (2) pixels in the output."
    type: transformation
    input_color: 1
    output_color: 2
    scope: "all pixels where input_color = 1"

  - observation: "White (0) pixels become red (2) in the output *if* they are to the right of a blue (1) pixel within the same row, and there are only white pixels between them"
    type: conditional_transformation

    output_color: 2
    condition: "exists blue pixel to the left in the same row, and no non-white pixels are in between."

  - observation: "Non-white or Non-blue colors terminate the transformation"
    type: termination_rule
    value: "any color other than white or blue"

  - observation: "Transformation occurs within each row independently."
