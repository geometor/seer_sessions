The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid seems to retain the dimensions but changes some pixels to red (2) and keeps others as white (0). The blue pixels are replaced, and their original horizontal position appears to be significant.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
