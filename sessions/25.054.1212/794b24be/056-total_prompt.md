## Example 10

**input:**
```
1 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A60520>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains values of 0 and 1, representing white and blue pixels, respectively. The output grid contains values of 0 and 2, representing white and red pixels, respectively. The transformation seems to involve a change in color based on the initial color and possibly its position or neighbors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    input_values: [0, 1]
    output_values: [0, 2]

properties:
  - name: color
    input_mapping:
      0: white
      1: blue
    output_mapping:
      0: white
      2: red

actions:
  - type: color_change
    conditions:
      - if input pixel is blue: change to red
      - if input pixel is blue and on first row: keep the red
      - if input pixel is blue and not first row, lower row: change to white if blue
      - if input pixel is white : it stays white

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid filled with pixels of colors white (0) and blue (1).

2.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
    *   If a pixel is blue (1), change its color to red (2) on the first row, leave the blue pixel below to white (0), or to white (0) if not on the first row and it's a blue pixel.
    *   If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0).

3.  **Output:** The result is a 3x3 output grid with pixels of colors white (0) and red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
