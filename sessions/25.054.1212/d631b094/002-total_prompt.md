## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7BFC489F7820>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The output grid contains only '1' (blue) pixels. The transformation seems to involve extracting or counting the '1' (blue) pixels from the input. The spatial arrangement of the 1s in the input doesn't seem to affect output, only their quantity.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1]
    description: Contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements: [1]
    description: Contains only blue (1) pixels.

actions:
  - name: extract_blue
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts or counts blue (1) pixels from the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: The number of blue pixels in the input grid determines the output grid, which is filled by that many.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create** an output grid. The number of cells in the output is the same count.
3.  **Fill** all cells output grid with blue (1) pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
