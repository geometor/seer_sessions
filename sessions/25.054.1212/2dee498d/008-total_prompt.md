## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4 4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4 4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x256 at 0x7BFC47503CD0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 1
4 2 1 4
4 1 2 4
1 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC47503DF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored numbers. The input grid appears to be a larger, repeating pattern, while the output grid is a smaller, condensed version of that pattern. It seems like the transformation involves extracting a specific sub-grid or "core" pattern from the input. The colors (represented by numbers) and their relative positions within the sub-grid are preserved in the output. The dimensions of the input are 4x12 and the output is 4x4.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid is a 2D array of colored numbers.
    dimensions: 4x12
    elements: integers representing colors
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid is a 2D array of colored numbers.
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers representing colors
  - relation: subgrid
    description: Output grid appears to be a subgrid of the input grid.
    details: The spatial arrangement of colors in the output is a subset of the arrangement in the input.
  - operation: extraction
    description: The transformation extracts a specific 4x4 section from the 4x12 input.
    details: The extracted section starts at the top-left corner of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the core pattern:** The output grid represents the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
2.  **Extract the subgrid:** Isolate the 4x4 subgrid at position (0,0) from the original input.
3.  **Output as grid:** Output the values from that section.

In essence, the transformation rule is to extract the 4x4 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
