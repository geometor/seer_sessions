The input grid appears to be a repeating pattern of colored squares, and the output grid seems to be a compressed or summarized version of the input. The colors are represented by single digits (1, 2, and 3), which correspond to blue, red, and green, respectively. The input grid has dimensions 2x6, while the output grid has dimensions 2x2. The key seems to lie in recognizing a repeating sub-pattern within the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, the repeating pattern is a 2x1 grid (a vertical pair of pixels). The pattern is `[2, 1]` on top row and `[2, 3]` on the bottom row.\n\n2. **Compress Grid:** The input is the repeating 2x1 subgrids and output is the first instance of the subgrids. The entire input grid consists of repetitions of this basic 2x1 pattern, extract the first occurance of the repeating pattern.\n\n3. **Output extraction:**  The program outputs a new grid comprised of the representative pattern.\n"
