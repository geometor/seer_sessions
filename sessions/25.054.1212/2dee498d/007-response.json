The input grid appears to be a larger, repeating pattern, while the output grid is a smaller, condensed version of that pattern. It seems like the transformation involves extracting a specific sub-grid or \"core\" pattern from the input. The colors (represented by numbers) and their relative positions within the sub-grid are preserved in the output. The dimensions of the input are 4x12 and the output is 4x4.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
