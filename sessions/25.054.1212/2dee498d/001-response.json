The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The colors are consistent between the input and output, meaning the transformation doesn't involve color changes. The spatial arrangement of the pixels is preserved, but some pixels are removed. The most prominent observation is that the output grid seems to represent a 3x3 \"core\" extracted from the center.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
