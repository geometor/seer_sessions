            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was overly specific, hardcoding coordinate-based swaps of azure (8) and gray (5). This approach worked for some pixels in the first example but failed to generalize to other examples and even missed some swaps within the first example. The core issue is that the code lacks a generalized rule; it's simply memorizing specific pixel locations and their transformations instead of understanding the underlying pattern. The strategy needs to shift from hardcoded coordinates to a rule-based approach that identifies *why* certain grays and azures are swapped.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the differences between the \"Expected Output\" and \"Transformed Output\" for *all* examples. This will pinpoint exactly which swaps are being missed or incorrectly performed.\n2.  **Identify a Pattern:** Look for a consistent rule governing the swaps. Consider spatial relationships (e.g., adjacency, rows, columns), color counts, or other patterns. It may involve relative positions rather than absolute coordinates.\n3. **Develop a general program**: use the identified facts to describe in natural language how to do the transformations.\n4.  **Refine the Code:** Translate the generalized rule into a more flexible Python code, likely using loops and conditional statements that apply the rule rather than hardcoding positions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis, code execution is not required for dreamer at this time):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *  Observations: Missed some 8<->5 swaps. Specifically: Row 2 Col 0 and 1, Row 3 Col 0 and 1.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Observations: Incorrectly changed (1,0) from 5 to 8, and changed (1,2) from 8 to 5 and (1,1) from 5 to 8.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Observations: Missed all 8<->5 swaps, changed 5s to 8s and 8s to 5s incorrectly.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - shape: varies (e.g., 5x5, 3x3)\n      - colors: contains integers 0-9 representing colors\n    actions:\n      - transform: modifies the grid based on a rule\n\n  - object: pixel\n    properties:\n      - color: an integer 0-9\n      - position: row and column index\n    actions:\n      - swap: exchange color values between two pixels, specifically gray (5) and azure (8)\n\n  - rule: swap_condition\n    description: Swaps gray(5) and azure(8) pixels based on consistent input output pattern.\n    details: The specific consistent pattern is that all instances of gray and azure are swapped.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.\n2.  **Check** if the pixel's color is gray (5).\n3.  **If** it is gray (5), **change** its color to azure (8).\n4.  **Check** if the pixel's color is azure (8).\n5. **If** it is azure(8), **change** its color to gray(5).\n6. **Return** the modified grid.\n\nIn simple terms, the transformation rule is: \"Swap all instances of gray (5) with azure (8), and all instances of azure (8) with gray (5) in the grid.\"\n"
