## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 2
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC44391AE0>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7BFC441A3100>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x9 grid containing single-digit integers (0-2), representing colors (blue, white, and red).  The output is a 1x5 grid, also with integers (0 and 1). The output seems to drastically reduce the information content of the input. The presence of multiple colors in the input, and only two in the output (white and blue), indicates some form of filtering or counting is likely involved.  The significant size reduction and specific output colors, along with the layout, suggest a counting of colored areas in the input followed by a selection.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 1x5
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue

actions:
  - type: count
    target: input_grid
    feature: color/value
  - type: select
    target: input_grid
  - type: create
    target: output_grid

relationships:
    - type: "input_to_output"
    - from : input_grid
    - to: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of times the color blue (1) appears in the input grid.
2.  **Construct Output:** Create a 1x5 output grid.
3.   Fill first four cells of output with color blue (value 1)
4.  **Finalize:** Place a white pixel (0) in the last/fifth cell of the output grid.

Essentially, the transformation counts occurrences of blue pixels, creates a row of four blue, one white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
