The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid only contains white (0) and blue (1). The size reduction is significant, suggesting a summarizing or aggregating operation rather than a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping. The colors in output appears to represent existence of a color in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For each region, check for the presence of the color blue (1).\n4. **Output**: Create new output row. For each region, if blue is present, output a blue (1) pixel, otherwise output a white (0) pixel. The final output should be a single row with 5 pixels. For example: region 1 of input has blue, output is 1, next region has blue, output is 1, next region has no blue, output is 0, etc.\n"
