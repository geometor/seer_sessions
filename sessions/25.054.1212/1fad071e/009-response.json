            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good starting point, but it overfit to the first training example. While it correctly produced a 1x5 grid with four blue pixels and one white pixel, it failed to accurately represent the expected output for *all* examples. The key error is in the first example, where two of the blue pixels should be white. It appears that there is some structure to the input grid that indicates the number of output pixels, which we ignored.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** We need to carefully analyze all three input/output pairs, paying close attention to any patterns or relationships *between* the input and output, not just within each separately. The previous code essentially ignored the input.\n2.  **Identify Key Features:** Determine what features in the input grid correlate with the number of blue and white pixels in the output grid.\n3. **Update Natural Language Program:** revise the description of the transformation to be more accurate, based on the re-examination.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nTo be precise, I will define the calculation for `pixels_off`. This metric will be the sum of the absolute differences between the expected output grid and the produced output grid for each cell.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output: `1 1 0 0 0`\n    *   Transformed Output: `1 1 1 1 0`\n    *   `pixels_off`: 2\n    *   Observations: The transformed output has too many blue pixels, the input grid has 5 occurences of blue pixels.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output: `1 1 1 1 0`\n    *   Transformed Output: `1 1 1 1 0`\n    *   `pixels_off`: 0\n    *   Observations: Perfect match, the input grid has 8 occurences of blue pixels.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 9x9\n    *   Expected Output: `1 1 1 1 0`\n    *   Transformed Output: `1 1 1 1 0`\n    *   `pixels_off`: 0\n    *   Observations: Perfect match, the input grid has 8 occurences of blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: 008\n  - input_type: 2D grid\n  - output_type: 2D grid (1x5)\n  - output_colors:\n    - blue (1)\n    - white (0)\n  - example_1:\n    - input_shape: 9x9\n    - output_shape: 1x5\n    - input_blue_count: 5\n    - output_blue_count: 2  # Corrected from previous assumption\n    - output_white_count: 3 # Corrected\n    - pixels_off: 2\n  - example_2:\n    - input_shape: 9x9\n    - output_shape: 1x5\n    - input_blue_count: 8\n    - output_blue_count: 4\n    - output_white_count: 1\n    - pixels_off: 0\n  - example_3:\n    - input_shape: 9x9\n    - output_shape: 1x5\n    - input_blue_count: 8\n    - output_blue_count: 4\n    - output_white_count: 1\n    - pixels_off: 0\n  - transformation_rule: \"The output grid is always 1x5. The number of blue pixels in the output might relate to the number of blue pixels, or perhaps blue regions, in the input, always followed by enough white pixels to fill the 5 elements.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Observe the Input:** Examine the input grid, specifically noting the blue pixels.\n2.  **Determine Output Length:** The output is always a 1x5 grid.\n3. **Output Pixel Generation**\n    1.  In the first example the number of blue pixels are half the input count, rounded down.\n    2. If there are more than 3 blue pixels in input, there are 4 blue pixels in output.\n    3. Fill the final cells with white to a total of 5 elements.\n\nThis revised natural language program, while still needing refinement, is a significant improvement because it attempts to relate the input to the output, which the previous version did not. The observation regarding 'regions' instead of just individual pixels could be a better direction.\n"
