- Input Shape: (3, 3)
- Output Shape: (3, 3)
- Match: False
- Pixels Off: 3
- Size Correct: True
- Color Palette Correct: True
- Correct Pixel Counts: False
- Observations: This reveals a critical flaw: the code isn't moving the 4 at all. It's almost behaving like it is iterating the rows first, instead of the columns, missing the shift entirely because of a single zero in the rightmost column.
