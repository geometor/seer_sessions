The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x7). The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of colored blocks, specifically a rotation. The colors themselves remain the same, but their positions change. There appears to be a consistent pattern in how the positions shift. There are some colors on the border.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
