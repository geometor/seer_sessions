Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Leave the bottom row of the grid unchanged.
2. Rotate the remaining 2x2 sub-grid defined by the center pixel clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Overwrite the cell to what now holds the top-left color with the background (0/white).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Leave the bottom row unchanged (already copied)

    # Rotate the 2x2 subgrid
    # extract top left
    top_left = input_grid[0, 0]

    # rotate, shift each element clockwise
    output_grid[0, 0] = input_grid[1, 0]  # top_left = bottom_left
    output_grid[0, 1] = top_left  # top_right = top_left
    output_grid[1, 0] = input_grid[1, 1]  # bottom_left = bottom_right
    output_grid[1, 1] = input_grid[0, 1]  # bottom_right = top_right

    # replace what use to be top-left with 0
    output_grid[0,0] = 0

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
