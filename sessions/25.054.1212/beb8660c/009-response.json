            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code are on the right track conceptually (identifying and shifting blocks down). However, the execution reveals several issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Block Shifting:** The code doesn't correctly calculate the maximum possible shift for each block. It considers obstacles, but the interaction isn't implemented perfectly. It sometimes moves parts of blocks, or not at all, which means that we are missing the dependency in the depth shift between elements in the block.\n2.  **Error in Example 3:** The error in Example 3 (\"index out of bounds\") suggests an issue related to how the code handles different input shapes. The program must handle moving the values to different spots based on an analysis of the entire block and not using simple one step moves down.\n3. Bottom Row: the bottom row should stay fixed - we implemented this correctly.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these issues will involve:\n\n1.  **Revising Block Shift Logic:** Focus on correctly calculating the maximum downward shift for an *entire* block, ensuring that all parts of the block move together.\n2.  **Addressing Edge Cases:** Specifically look at examples like 3, where simpler shifts might cause out-of-bounds errors or where blocks might merge incorrectly. The current depth shift calculation is too complex.\n3.  **Refining Coordinate Tracking:** Ensure the code correctly tracks the original and new positions of *all* pixels within a block.\n4. Rethink blocks. It might be better to consider columns of single values, as this will make the shift mechanic trivial.\n\n**Metrics and Observations per Example**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations about objects and actions:\n\n*Example 1*\n- input is 10 x 7\n- output is 10 x 7\n- match: False\n- pixels\\_off: 31\n\n*Example 2*\n- input is 7 x 4\n- output is 7 x 4\n- match: False\n- pixels\\_off: 9\n\n*Example 3*\n- input is 3 x 3\n- output is 3 x 3\n- match: ERROR\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 5f972961\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_1: {type: block, color: 2, positions: [(0, 1), (0, 2)]}\n      - object_2: {type: block, color: 3, positions: [(1, 4)]}\n      - object_3: {type: block, color: 1, positions: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]}\n      - object_4: {type: block, color: 5, positions: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]}\n      - object_5: {type: block, color: 6, positions: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)]}\n      - object_6: {type: block, color: 4, positions: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)]}\n      - object_7: {type: block, color: 8, positions: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]}\n    output_objects:\n      - object_1: {type: block, color: 2, positions: [(4, 5), (4, 6)]}\n      - object_2: {type: block, color: 3, positions: [(3, 5)]}\n      - object_3: {type: block, color: 1, positions: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)]}\n      - object_4: {type: block, color: 5, positions: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]}\n      - object_5: {type: block, color: 6, positions: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 1)]}\n      - object_6: {type: block, color: 4, positions: [(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)]}\n      - object_7: {type: block, color: 8, positions: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]}\n    action: shift_blocks_down_keep_bottom_row\n  - id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - object_1: {type: block, color: 1, positions: [(0,3)]}\n      - object_2: {type: block, color: 2, positions: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]}\n      - object_3: {type: block, color: 3, positions: [(4, 1), (4, 2)]}\n      - object_4: {type: block, color: 8, positions: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6,3)]}\n    output_objects:\n      - object_1: {type: block, color: 1, positions: [(3,3)]}\n      - object_2: {type: block, color: 2, positions: [(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)]}\n      - object_3: {type: block, color: 3, positions: [(4, 1), (4, 2)]}\n      - object_4: {type: block, color: 8, positions: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6,3)]}\n    action: shift_blocks_down_keep_bottom_row\n  - id: 3\n    input_objects:\n        - object_1: {type: block, color: 2, positions: [(0, 0), (0, 1)]}\n        - object_2: {type: block, color: 4, positions: [(1, 1)]}\n        - object_3: {type: block, color: 8, positions: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]}\n    output_objects:\n        - object_1: {type: block, color: 2, positions: [(1, 1), (1, 2)]}\n        - object_2: {type: block, color: 4, positions: [(0, 2)]}\n        - object_3: {type: block, color: 8, positions: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]}\n    action: shift_blocks_down_keep_bottom_row\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Columns:** Treat each non-zero pixel as the start of an independent \"column.\"\n2.  **Fixed Bottom Row:** The bottom row of the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.\n3.  **Shift Down:** For each column, starting from the top, shift each non-zero pixel down to the lowest available empty space within that column, while maintaining the original order of pixels in the column. Available space does NOT include the fixed bottom row, unless the cell is already occupied by a non-zero pixel.\n4. The result of the shift will leave blank (0 valued) pixels at the top of the column.\n\nThis simpler column-based approach avoids the complexities of multi-pixel block management and should correctly handle all provided examples.\n"
