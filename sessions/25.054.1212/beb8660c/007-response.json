The primary operation seems to be a rearrangement or shifting of colored blocks (contiguous pixels of the same color) within the grid. The colors themselves remain unchanged, only their positions are altered. There appears to be a downward movement of blocks, potentially filling empty spaces (represented by white pixels, value 0) below them.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The block will stop moving down when it reaches the bottom edge, any non-zero pixel or when empty pixels on other rows are present.\n3. **Preserve the bottom row:** The bottom row should always be fixed and it should not move.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule is to \"shift all contiguous non-zero color blocks down, filling the spaces, but keep the bottom row fixed.\".\n"
