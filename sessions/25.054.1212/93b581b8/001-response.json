The input grid appears to have a central 2x2 block of non-zero pixels, surrounded by zero-value pixels. The output grid seems to maintain this central 2x2 block but also includes additional non-zero pixels at the top and bottom, mirroring/replicating parts of the central block and specific corners from it, potentially diagonally.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
