The input grid contains a cluster of four pixels with distinct colors (yellow, magenta, red, and blue) in the top-left corner, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid seems to be a modification of the input grid with some new elements. Specifically I observe:\n\n1.  The original 2x2 colored cluster in the input remains unchanged.\n2.  A new 2x2 structure of yellow pixels appears below the original cluster.\n3. new single blue and red cells appear\n4. The relative position is not always clear, and needs checking\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
