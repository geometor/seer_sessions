## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 3 0 0
0 0 7 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC44365F30>

**output:**
```
8 8 0 0 7 7
8 8 0 0 7 7
0 0 9 3 0 0
0 0 7 8 0 0
3 3 0 0 9 9
3 3 0 0 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC44366D70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). The input grid appears to have a central 2x2 block of non-zero pixels, surrounded by zero-value pixels. The output grid seems to maintain this central 2x2 block but also includes additional non-zero pixels at the top and bottom, mirroring/replicating parts of the central block and specific corners from it, potentially diagonally.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x6
      elements: pixels (integers 0-9)
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x2
      location: center
      elements: [9, 3, 7, 8] # maroon, green, orange, azure
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      location: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: mirror_and_extend
    description: Certain pixels from the central block, and the corners diagonally opposite of the central block's corners, are mirrored and extended towards the top and bottom edges of the grid.

relationships:
  - central_block_to_output_top:  The values 7 and 8 (orange, azure) from lower row of central block are copied and repeated, at the top of the grid to form a 2x2 azure and a 2x2 orange block of pixels.
  - central_block_to_output_bottom: The values 9 and 3 (maroon, green) from the top row of the central block are copied and repeated, at the bottom of the grid to form a 2x2 green and a 2x2 maroon block of pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Block:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center of the input grid.
2.  **Top Extension**: Copy/mirror pixels `[2,1]` and `[2,0]` and `[3,1]` and `[3,0]`(using 0-indexed based row and column) of the input to the top two rows of the entire grid
3. **Bottom Extension**: Copy pixels `[3,1]` and `[3,0]` and `[2,1]` and `[2,0]` to the bottom two rows of the grid.
4.  **Preserve Center:** The original 2x2 central block remains unchanged in its original position.

Essentially, the rule takes certain corner pixels and copies and repeats each to the top and bottom to fill those areas, while the center remains intact.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
