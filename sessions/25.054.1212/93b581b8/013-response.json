The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of certain colored regions across a central 2x2 block. Specifically, the 2x2 colored block in the center of the input (green, magenta, gray, red) seems to remain unchanged, while other regions composed of connected cells of the same color are created, related to color changes present around the original 2 x 2 area.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
