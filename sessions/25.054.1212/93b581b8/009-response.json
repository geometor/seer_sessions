            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of preserving a 2x2 core cluster and creating a new 2x2 cluster below it, based on inferred colors above and below. The results show that the core concept of finding the unique 2x2 core is good, but the placement and color inference of the additional pixels is wrong.\nThe upper and lower color inference logic does not match the intention described in the existing docstring. The code appears to not be updating the grid, but reinitializing a copy of the input grid.\nWe need to revise the approach to correctly handle a translation of the core, and identification of the correct fill colors.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. **Correct color selection**: refine the color selection for mirrored pixels by using color mirroring, rather than inferring from above/below cells.\n2. **Correct Translations**: adjust how translations are completed - shift the *entire* 2x2 core cluster down *two* spaces\n3. **Ensure Updates**: ensure updates are made to the `output_grid`.\n4. **Generalize**: develop reporting on the assumptions in the original code and the overall strategy\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including some properties of interest:\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n*   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n*   Core Cluster: (9, 3, 7, 8) at (2, 2)\n*   Upper color: (8)\n*   Lower color: None (0)\n* Notes: Appears that the colors of the 2x2 cluster are mirrored horizontally two rows above, and vertically two rows below.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n*   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n*   Core Cluster: (4, 6, 2, 1) at (1, 1)\n*    Upper color: None (0)\n*   Lower color: None(0)\n* Notes: Appears that the colors of the 2x2 cluster are mirrored horizontally three rows below, and vertically one row above.\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n*   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n*   Core Cluster: (3, 6, 5, 2) at (2, 2)\n*   Upper color: (2)\n*   Lower color: None (0)\n* Notes: Appears that the colors of the 2x2 cluster are mirrored horizontally two rows above, and vertically two rows below.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    core_cluster:\n      position: [2, 2]\n      colors: [9, 3, 7, 8]\n    transformations:\n      - type: horizontal_mirror\n        offset: -2\n        cluster_colors: [7,8,9,3]\n      - type: vertical_mirror\n        offset: 2\n        cluster_colors: [9,3,7,8]\n\n  - id: 2\n    core_cluster:\n      position: [1, 1]\n      colors: [4, 6, 2, 1]\n    transformations:\n      - type: horizontal_mirror\n        offset: 3\n        cluster_colors: [2,1,4,6]\n      - type: vertical_mirror\n        offset: -1\n        cluster_colors: [4,6,2,1]\n\n  - id: 3\n    core_cluster:\n      position: [2, 2]\n      colors: [3, 6, 5, 2]\n    transformations:\n      - type: horizontal_mirror\n        offset: -2\n        cluster_colors: [5,2,3,6]\n      - type: vertical_mirror\n        offset: 2\n        cluster_colors: [3,6,5,2]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Cluster:** Find the 2x2 square within the input grid that contains four unique, non-zero colored pixels.\n2.  **Mirror Horizontally:** Create a mirrored 2x2 of the core, positioned with an offset specific to the example (either -2, 3, or -2 rows from the original cluster)\n3.  **Mirror Vertically**: Create a mirrored 2x2 of the core, position with an offset specific to the example (either 2, -1, or 2 rows from the original cluster)\n4. **Output**: Ensure that all transformations from steps 2 and 3 are combined on a copy of the input grid.\n\n"
