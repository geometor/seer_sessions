## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 6 0 0
0 0 5 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC4757EF50>

**output:**
```
2 2 0 0 5 5
2 2 0 0 5 5
0 0 3 6 0 0
0 0 5 2 0 0
6 6 0 0 3 3
6 6 0 0 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC47F93430>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 6x6 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of certain colored regions across a central 2x2 block. Specifically, the 2x2 colored block in the center of the input (green, magenta, gray, red) seems to remain unchanged, while other regions composed of connected cells of the same color are created, related to color changes present around the original 2 x 2 area.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 6x6.
  - observation: |
      Grid cells contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
  - object: |
      Central 2x2 block:  Contains colors 3 (green), 6 (magenta), 5 (gray), and 2 (red). Remains unchanged.
  - object: |
      Top Left 2x2 mirrored object : color 2 (red)
  - object: |
     Top Right 2x2 mirrored object : color 5 (grey)
  - object: |
     Bottom Left 2x2 mirrored object : color 6 (magenta)
  - object: |
     Bottom Right 2x2 mirrored object : color 3 (green)
  - relationship: |
      The central 2x2 block is constant between input and output.
  - transformation: |
      Mirroring: Creation of connected 2 x 2 areas in corners from central square color reference, excluding colors 0, 5, 2.
  - action: |
      The transformation creates additional instances of some colors surrounding a central block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Block:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero colored pixels in the center of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the Central Block:** Copy the central 2x2 block directly to the output grid without changes.
3.  **Create Mirrored Blocks**: For each color except colors 0, 2, and 5 in central area:
    *   Examine colors in central block
    *   If color = 3, then duplicate the 2 x 2 area in the lower right hand corner
    *   If color = 6, then duplicate the 2 x 2 area in the lower left hand corner
    *   If color = 5, then duplicate the 2 x 2 area in the upper right hand corner
    *    If color = 2, then duplicate the 2 x 2 area in the upper left hand corner


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
