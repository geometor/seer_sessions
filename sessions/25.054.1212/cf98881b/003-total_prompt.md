"""
1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Select columns from the input grid that contain *either* the digit '9' *or* the digit '4', *or* the digit '1'. Do *not* select all columns, only the select columns identified by the rule.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** From the selected columns, create a new grid, discarding all others.

3. **Reduce Further:** Consider only the first instance of a contiguous vertical sequence of a single color. Discard any subsequent, matching color that is contiguous vertically.

4. **Result:** the output grid contains only 4x4

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
