## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 4 0 4 2 9 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0 2 0 0 9 9 2 0 1 0 0
4 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 0
4 4 4 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC4423FFA0>

**output:**
```
9 4 0 4
0 4 9 9
4 1 1 0
4 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4423FDF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The colors and their corresponding digits are:

*   0: White
*   1: Blue
*   2: Red
*   3: Green
*   4: Yellow
*   5: Gray
*   6: Magenta
*   7: Orange
*   8: Azure
*   9: Maroon

The input grid appears to be larger (4x14) than the output grid (4x4). There's no obvious one-to-one mapping of input cells to output cells. Certain colors are entirely removed during the transformation (red, white, blue). Specific instances of colors remain. It appears that a selection and reduction process takes place, and there might be rules about retaining or deleting colors and specific locations of color instances.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 4x14
    elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  - observation: color_reduction
    description: Some colors in the input are absent in the output (red, white, blue).
  - observation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: Some colors are present in both input and output (yellow, maroon).
  - observation: position
    description: The spatial positions or relative ordering of the pixels that are preserved appear to matter.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Select columns from the input grid that contain *either* the digit '9' *or* the digit '4', *or* the digit '1'. Do *not* select all columns, only the select columns identified by the rule.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** From the selected columns, create a new grid, discarding all others.

3. **Reduce Further:** Consider only the first instance of a contiguous vertical sequence of a single color. Discard any subsequent, matching color that is contiguous vertically.

4. **Result:** the output grid contains only 4x4

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
