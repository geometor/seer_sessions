Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The colors and their corresponding digits are:

*   0: White
*   1: Blue
*   2: Red
*   3: Green
*   4: Yellow
*   5: Gray
*   6: Magenta
*   7: Orange
*   8: Azure
*   9: Maroon

The input grid appears to be larger (4x14) than the output grid (4x4). There's no obvious one-to-one mapping of input cells to output cells. Certain colors are entirely removed during the transformation (red, white, blue). Specific instances of colors remain. It appears that a selection and reduction process takes place, and there might be rules about retaining or deleting colors and specific locations of color instances.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 4x14
    elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  - observation: color_reduction
    description: Some colors in the input are absent in the output (red, white, blue).
  - observation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: Some colors are present in both input and output (yellow, maroon).
  - observation: position
    description: The spatial positions or relative ordering of the pixels that are preserved appear to matter.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Select columns from the input grid that contain *either* the digit '9' *or* the digit '4', *or* the digit '1'. Do *not* select all columns, only the select columns identified by the rule.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** From the selected columns, create a new grid, discarding all others.

3. **Reduce Further:** Consider only the first instance of a contiguous vertical sequence of a single color. Discard any subsequent, matching color that is contiguous vertically.

4. **Result:** the output grid contains only 4x4
