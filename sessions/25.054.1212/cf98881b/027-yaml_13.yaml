      Fails to incorporate all '9' and blue pixels ('1') correctly. The
      expansion logic around the border of the initial yellow object is not
      including a blue '1' that it should.
      The transformed grid should have one '9' that it does not, but
      it does correctly include all the yellows.

  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: [4, 14]
    output_shape: [4, 4]
    match: False
    pixels_off: 3 #confirmed with code

    correct_pixel_counts: False

        Missing a row. It looks like the box expansion is still not working -
        it fails to capture a blue pixel ('1') in row 3, column 2 and another '1'
        in the last row that should expand the final bounding box.
        There is also a 9 that should be a 0 in the bottom row.

        Fails to switch the colors. The bounding box seems like it might be
        working, however it did not swap the colors.

      It looks like there is a problem with the colors. The right '9' is not
      being changed to a '0', and '0' that should be '9'.

  - example_id: 5
    input_shape: [4, 14]

    notes: >
        The box appears to be the correct dimensions, but fails to swap certain
        pixels, including replacing '0' with '1'.
