## Example 5

**input:**
```
4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1
4 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 9 2 1 1 0 0
0 4 4 4 2 0 9 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
0 4 4 0 2 0 0 9 0 2 0 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC441A1120>

**output:**
```
4 0 4 1
4 4 4 4
1 4 4 4
0 4 4 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC441A0CA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions: yellow (4), white (0), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input, retaining only the yellow (4), some white (0) and some blue(1) pixels. The output grid appears to be a cropped portion of the input grid, focusing on a specific region and potentially reducing non-yellow or non-blue objects.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
    dimensions: 4x14
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Condensed version of the input grid.
    dimensions: 4x4
  - colors:
    - id: 0
      name: white
    - id: 1
      name: blue
    - id: 2
      name: red
    - id: 4
      name: yellow
    - id: 9
      name: maroon
  - observation: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: The color yellow (4) dominates both grids.
  - observation: Other colours like red and maroon seem to disappear.
  - observation: output grid seems to be a cropped sub-region of input

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Largest Yellow Region:** Locate the largest contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Contiguous means pixels are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2.  **Define a Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that fully encloses this largest yellow region.
3. **Consider adjacent blue:** Expand bounding box if needed to include all blue squares directly adjacent to yellow region.
4.  **Extract the Subgrid:** Extract the portion of the input grid corresponding to the bounding box.
5. **Replace within Bounding box:** Replace all colors other than yellow and blue with white within the extracted subgrid.
6.  **Return Subgrid:** The resulting subgrid is the output.

Essentially, the transformation extracts a specific region of the input grid based on the largest connected yellow area, including adjacent blue, and simplifies other colours.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
