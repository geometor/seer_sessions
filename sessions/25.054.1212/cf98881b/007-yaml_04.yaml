objects:
  - grid_input:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 14x4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - contains multiple colors
  - grid_output:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - contains a subset of input colors
        - specific spatial arrangement

actions:
  - crop:
      description: Selects a sub-region of the input grid.
      parameters:
        start_row: unknown
        start_col: unknown
        end_row: unknown
        end_col: unknown
  - filter_colors:
    description: removes or substitute colors.
  - substitute:
      description: Replaces certain colors with others.
      parameters:
        original_color: [2,9]
        replacement_color: [1,9]

relationships:
  - grid_output is derived from grid_input
  - cropping defines the spatial boundaries of the output
  - filter/substitute defines the color composition of output.
