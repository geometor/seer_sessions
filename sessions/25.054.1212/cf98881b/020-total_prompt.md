## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 9 2 0 0 0 0
4 4 0 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 0 0 0 0
4 0 4 4 2 0 9 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
0 4 4 4 2 0 9 0 0 2 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC443EFB20>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 4
4 4 9 4
4 9 4 4
1 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC443ECC40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed version, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors and shapes. The most notable colors in the input are yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1), and white (0). The output seems to focus on yellow (4), maroon (9), and a single blue (1) pixel, with other elements disappearing. It appears there is some type of selection and possibly spatial rearrangement or cropping.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 4 x 15
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      colors_present: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 4 x 4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      colors_present: [0,1,4,9]

  - observation: color_selection
    description: Only specific colors from the input grid appear in the output grid.
    selected_colors: [1, 4, 9]

  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: The relative positions of some colors are maintained, but the overall structure is compressed. The output appears to be a cropped selection. The columns in input that contain [4,4,4,4] appear important

  - observation: cropping
    description: columns with any of [1,4,9]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Columns:** Examine the input grid and identify columns that contain *only* the colors yellow (4), maroon (9) or blue(1).
2. **Select Columns**: Select those key columns
3.  **Crop**: produce the output using the key columns


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
