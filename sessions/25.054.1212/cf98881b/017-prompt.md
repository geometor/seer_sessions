Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The target colors are 4 (yellow) and 9 (maroon).
2.  **Find Centroid of Color 9:** Find an approximate "centroid" of the color 9 pixels.  Not a true centroid, but a representative point.
3.  **Determine Quadrant:**  Divide the input grid conceptually into four quadrants based on the overall input grid dimensions (not the color 9 centroid).
4.  **Select Input Quadrant:** Select the quadrant of the input grid that contains the "centroid" of color 9.
5.  **Extract 4x4 Subgrid:** From the selected quadrant, extract a 4x4 subgrid. The top-left corner of this subgrid is determined as follows:
    - If the "centroid" of color 9 falls within the 4x4 area from the top-left of its quadrant, take the quadrant's top-left as the subgrid origin.
    - Consider the subgrid around the instances of 9.
    - Consider mirroring the subgrid based on the original prediction being the mirror of the correct output.
6. **compose output:** construct output_grid from the selected subgrid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
