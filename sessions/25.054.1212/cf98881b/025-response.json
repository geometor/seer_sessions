The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions: yellow (4), white (0), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input, retaining only the yellow (4), some white (0) and some blue(1) pixels. The output grid appears to be a cropped portion of the input grid, focusing on a specific region and potentially reducing non-yellow or non-blue objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Contiguous means pixels are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2.  **Define a Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that fully encloses this largest yellow region.\n3. **Consider adjacent blue:** Expand bounding box if needed to include all blue squares directly adjacent to yellow region.\n4.  **Extract the Subgrid:** Extract the portion of the input grid corresponding to the bounding box.\n5. **Replace within Bounding box:** Replace all colors other than yellow and blue with white within the extracted subgrid.\n6.  **Return Subgrid:** The resulting subgrid is the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts a specific region of the input grid based on the largest connected yellow area, including adjacent blue, and simplifies other colours.\n"
