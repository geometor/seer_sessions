objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: rows x columns (variable)
      - target_colors: [9, 4, 1] # Maroon, Yellow, Blue
  - name: column
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9)

  - name: contiguous_block
    type: sequence of cells
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: row and column indices
      - first_instance: boolean

actions:
  - name: select_columns
    input: grid
    output: set of columns
    logic: Select columns containing at least one cell with value in target_colors.

  - name: determine_order
    input: set of columns and input_grid
    output: ordered list of columns, last_occurrence_row
    logic:
      - For each target color, find the *last* row index where it occurs, across the entire grid.
      - Sort colors based on these indices from largest to smallest.
      - Within each color group, maintain original column order from the input.

  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: grid, ordered columns
    output: grid
    logic: Create a new grid containing only the ordered columns.

  - name: reduce_vertical
    input: grid
    output: grid
    logic: For each column, keep only the *first* contiguous block of non-zero pixels.

  - name: limit_columns
    input: grid
    output: grid
    logic: take first 4 columns
