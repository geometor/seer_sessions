Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of numerical values. The input grid contains a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The output grid seems to expand this line and introduce a new color, azure (8). The transformation appears to be localized around the initial orange line, with a checkerboard-like pattern emerging. The lower, uncolored portion of the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x8 (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x8 (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: orange_line
    type: line
    properties:
      - color: orange (7)
      - orientation: vertical
      - position: column 3 in input_grid
      - length: 5 pixels
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - pattern: checkerboard, adjacent to orange
  - action: transformation
    type: local_expansion
    description: The orange line expands, adding azure pixels in a specific pattern.
  - relationship:
      - type: spatial
      - description: Azure pixels are placed adjacent to the orange pixels, creating a checkerboard pattern on the top part.
      - description: The empty area (value 0) under orange line remain unchanged.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the vertical line of orange (7) pixels in the input grid. Note its starting and ending row indices.
2.  **Checkerboard Expansion:** Starting from the top of the orange line and extending to the last element.
    *   For every orange pixel, check all the vertically and horizontally adjacent pixels above the row where line ends.
    *   If an adjacent pixel has a value of 0, change it to azure (8).
    *   If an adjacent pixel has a value of 7, leave as it is.
    *   If an adjacent pixel has a value of 8, extend transformation by one step.
3.   **Preservation:** All the pixels below the original orange line remain unchanged.

In essence, the transformation propagates outwards from the initial orange line in the input grid, in a checkerboard fashion, restricted to the rows occupied by original vertical line.
