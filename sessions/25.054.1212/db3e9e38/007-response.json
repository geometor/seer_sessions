The input grid contains a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The output grid seems to expand this line and introduce a new color, azure (8). The transformation appears to be localized around the initial orange line, with a checkerboard-like pattern emerging. The lower, uncolored portion of the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
