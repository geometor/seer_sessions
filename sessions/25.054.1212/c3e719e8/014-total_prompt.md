## Example 3

**input:**
```
6 9 9
4 6 8
9 9 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44367EE0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 6 9 9 6 9 9
0 0 0 4 6 8 4 6 8
0 0 0 9 9 8 9 9 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 9 9 6 9 9 0 0 0
4 6 8 4 6 8 0 0 0
9 9 8 9 9 8 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC44367400>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix. The output grid seems to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid, along with a large area filled with zeros (white color). The input grid seems to be replicated in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - colors: varied
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - colors: varied
  - relationship: replication
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is replicated four times within the output grid, at the corners.
  - relationship: padding
    subject: output_grid
    description:  The central 3x3 area and areas around the replicated grids, are padded with zeros (white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with zeros (white color).

2.  **Replication:** Copy the 3x3 input grid to four positions within the output grid:
    *   Top-left corner: Position (0,0) of output grid.
    *   Top-right corner: Position (0,6) of output grid
    *   Bottom-left corner: Position (6,0) of the output grid.
    *   Bottom-right corner: Position (6,6) of output grid.

3.  **Padding:** The remaining cells of the output grid are zeros. We have already pre-filled at the beginning, so we do not need a padding phase.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
