            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was on the right track, conceptually, by recognizing the replication of the input grid. However, it incorrectly positioned the top-right and bottom-left copies, and especially failed to pad correctly as shown in the examples. The core issue is with the positioning logic and understanding the intended layout. We need to adjust the offsets to accurately place the replicated grids in the corners, not in the center row/column as written, and to correctly align and pad the borders.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully look at the input and expected output pairs again to solidify the *exact* positioning and padding.\n2.  **Correct Offsets:** Adjust the row and column offsets in the code to place the copies in the correct corners.\n3.  **Verify Padding:** Ensure the padding with zeros (white) is happening correctly. The padding creates a border around the input grids, but the input grids may not be in the center. The output size depends on the border width, and, in this case the padding is on the opposite side of the replication.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using provided results, no code execution needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Expected Output Size: 9x9\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 9x9 (Correct)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 27\n    *   Notes: Top-right and bottom-left copies are misplaced. Padding is on the wrong sides of the copies.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Expected Output Size: 9x9\n    *   Transformed Output Size: 9x9 (Correct)\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 18\n    *   Notes: Similar issues to Example 1, but also has alignment issues.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input Size: 3x3\n    *    Output Size: 9x9\n    *    Transformed Output Size: 9x9\n    *    Match: False\n    *    Pixels Off: 36\n    *    Notes: Similar issues.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 014\nobjects:\n  - id: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      colors: [0-9]\n      shape: rectangle\n  - id: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      colors: [0, input_grid colors]\n      shape: rectangle\n  - id: replicated_grid_1\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      source: input_grid\n      location: top-left\n  - id: replicated_grid_2\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      source: input_grid\n      location: top-right\n  - id: replicated_grid_3\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      source: input_grid\n      location: bottom-left\n - id: replicated_grid_4\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      source: input_grid\n      location: bottom-right\n  - id: padding\n    type: grid_area\n    properties:\n     color: 0\n     location: around replicated grids\nactions:\n  - replicate:\n      source: input_grid\n      targets: [replicated_grid_1, replicated_grid_2, replicated_grid_3, replicated_grid_4]\n  - pad:\n      target: output_grid\n      with: padding\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros (color 0, white).\n2. **Replicate to Top Left.** Place a copy of the input grid at the top-left corner of the output grid.\n3.  **Replicate to Top Right.** Place a copy of the input grid at the top-right corner of the output grid. The correct top-right starts at row 0 and col 9-input\\_grid\\_width.\n4.  **Replicate to Bottom Left.** Place a copy of the input grid at the bottom-left corner of the output grid. The correct bottom-left starts at row 9-input\\_grid\\_height and col 0.\n5.  **Replicate to Bottom Right.** Place a copy of the input grid in the bottom-right corner of the output grid. The correct bottom-right starts at row 9-input\\_grid\\_height and col 9 - input\\_grid\\_width.\n"
