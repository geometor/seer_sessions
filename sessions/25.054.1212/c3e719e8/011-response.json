            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on tiling the input grid 3x3 and then setting the border of *each tile* to color 0. The results clearly show this isn't correct. The expected outputs show that sometimes the border of the entire output is set to 0, and sometimes the border of original input tiles are set to 0, and other times the expanded output is set to 0. It is very likely the rule is conditional on some properties of input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example Carefully:** Examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for each of the three training examples. Pay close attention to the differences between the expected and actual outputs.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for patterns in how the input grid's properties relate to whether border pixels are set to 0 for the tile or entire output.\n3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect a more accurate rule, and show how this resolves the problems of the prior attempt.\n4. Test thoroughly to avoid an overcorrection to a single example.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\nHere is the metrics data from previous code execution:\n```\nExample 1: match: False, pixels_off: 30\nExample 2: match: False, pixels_off: 51\nExample 3: match: False, pixels_off: 37\n```\nAll cases got the output size correct, got color palette correct. All examples failed pixel counts and match tests.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The input grid is always a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.\n  - observation: |\n      The output grid is a 9x9 grid, suggesting a 3x3 tiling operation.\n  - observation: |\n      The borders of the individual tiles *and/or* the entire grid are sometimes set to 0 (white), but not always.\n  - property: input_grid_size: 3x3\n  - property: output_grid_size: 9x9\n  - action: tile_input_grid: |\n      The input grid is tiled 3x3 to create a larger grid.\n  - action: set_border_to_zero: |\n      Pixels on the border of either the tiles or the entire output grid are set to 0, but rules are inconsistent\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Tile:** Create a 3x3 tiling of the input grid. This means the input grid is repeated nine times in a 3x3 arrangement.\n2. **Conditional Border Update**\n    * Check some condition TBD based on the contents of the original input.\n    *    Border Entire Grid: If the condition is true, set color of the border of the *entire* 9x9 output grid to 0.\n    *    Border Individual Tiles: If the condition is false, set the color of the border of *each* 3x3 tile within the 9x9 output grid to 0.\n\nThe previous code always bordered individual tiles. Now it is clear it should be one or the other.\n\nNext step is to review the examples to discover what conditions will make the correct choice.\n"
