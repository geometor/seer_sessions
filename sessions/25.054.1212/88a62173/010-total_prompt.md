Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code are on the right track conceptually. The idea of dividing the input grid into quadrants and condensing information into a 2x2 output grid is correct. However, the original program was too specific, focusing only on blue (value 1). The provided examples demonstrate that the logic should apply to *any* non-white (non-zero) color present in each quadrant, and the specific non-zero color of the output should match any non-zero values found in the input quadrant. The current implementation correctly identifies the quadrants but fails to correctly represent the dominant color when it is not blue.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Quadrant Logic:** Maintain the existing quadrant division logic, as it correctly divides the input grid.
2.  **Generalize Color Detection:** Modify the logic to detect *any* non-zero color within a quadrant, not just blue (1).
3.  **Correct Color Output**: Ensure that the color used for the 2x2 output is taken from the any non-zero color detected in the corresponding input quadrant.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's an analysis of each example, aided by some imagined "code execution" to clarify certain points (since I can't actually execute the code in this environment):

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Expected Output Colors: {0, 2}
    *   Actual Output Colors: {0}
    *   Analysis: The code failed to detect and propagate the red (2) color from the quadrants. It only checked for blue.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Expected Output Colors: {0, 1}
    *   Actual Output Colors: {1}
    *   Analysis: While the code correctly identified the presence of blue, it incorrectly filled a quadrant. The top-right quadrant of the input does *not* contain any 1's, so output (0,1) should be 0.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Expected Output Colors: {0, 8}
    *   Actual Output Colors: {0}
    *   Analysis: Similar to Example 1, the code failed to detect and propagate the azure (8) color.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: 008_task
  - input_grid_size: variable
  - output_grid_size: 2x2
  - quadrant_division:
      description: Input grid is divided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
      method: Integer division of rows and columns by 2.
  - color_check:
      description: Each quadrant is checked for the presence of any non-zero color.
      logic: if any pixel value in quadrant != 0
  - output_value:
      description: The output cell corresponding to a quadrant takes the value of the non-zero pixel.  If there are no non-zero colors, it takes a zero value.
      logic: output_pixel = input_quadrant.first_non_zero_pixel #Conceptual
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. The midpoint for division is calculated by integer division of the number of rows and columns by 2.
2.  **Inspect:** For each quadrant, examine all pixel values.
3.  **Detect Non-Zero:** If *any* pixel within the quadrant has a non-zero value, record the *first* non-zero value found.
4.  **Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid. For each cell in the output grid:
    *   If a non-zero value was found in the corresponding input quadrant, set the output cell to that non-zero value.
    *   If no non-zero value was found (all pixels are 0/white) in the input quadrant, set the output cell to 0 (white).

This revised natural language program accounts for the presence of any non-zero color and accurately describes the transformation. It prioritizes using the *first* detected non-zero value, if present, to set the output cell's value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
