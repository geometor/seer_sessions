Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the initial code output to develop a natural language program and a YAML block describing the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focuses on extracting grid properties (height, width, unique colors, color counts, and the top-left 2x2 subgrid). This approach is useful for gathering information, but it doesn't directly describe the *transformation* from input to output. The provided code execution results are `None` because the code only analyzes, doesn't transform. The core task is to identify the upper left 2x2 section after performing a specific object selection and reduction. The current code does not attempt to identify the rule. It gives information about the inputs and outputs but doesn't compare them in a way that identifies the rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify the Core Transformation:** The output consistently appears to be a 2x2 grid. This, and a close visual inspection strongly, suggests that the transformation involves extracting a specific 2x2 region from the input.
2.  **Determine the Selection Rule:** The key is figuring out *which* 2x2 region is selected. By observation, only the non-black (non-zero) colored squares from the top left 3x3 section are selected, and the others are discarded. Then of those, we are selecting the upper left 2x2 section.
3. **Metrics Gathering:**
    *   We need to locate the colored squares from the top left 3x3 section.

**Metrics Gathering (using observations and reasoning, no code execution needed at this point):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid.
    *   Relevant Feature: The top-left 3x3 contains the non-black squares:
        ```
        [0, 2, 0],
        [2, 2, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
        ```
      The non-black squares are:
        ```
        [ , 2,  ],
        [2, 2,  ],
        [ ,  ,  ]
        ```
      Taking the top left 2x2 of that gives:
        ```
        [2, 2],
        [2, 0]
        ```
    *   Output: 2x2 grid, as expected.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid.
        ```
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
        ```
      The non-black squares are:
        ```
        [1,  ,  ],
        [ , 1,  ],
        [ ,  ,  ]
        ```
      Taking the top left 2x2 of that gives:

        ```
        [1, 0],
        [0, 1]
        ```
    *   Output: 2x2 grid, as expected.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid.
      The top-left 3x3 contains the non-black squares:
        ```
        [8, 8, 0],
        [8, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
        ```
      The non-black squares are:
        ```
        [8, 8,  ],
        [8,  ,  ],
        [ ,  ,  ]
        ```
      Taking the top left 2x2 of that gives:
        ```
        [8, 8],
        [8, 0]
        ```
    *   Output: 2x2 grid, as expected.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: d511f180
  - observations: |
      All input grids are 5x5.
      All output grids are 2x2.
      The output grids appear to be a subsection of the input grids.
      The output grids contain colors present in the input grid, plus black.
      The non-black values seem to come from a specific region, with a maximum of 2 from each row and column.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: 5x5
      - name: output_grid
        type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: 2x2
      - name: selection_region
        type: subgrid
        properties:
          - dimensions: 3x3
          - location: top-left corner of input_grid
  - actions:
    - name: select_non_black_pixels
      description: Identify and select the non-black pixels within the selection region.
    - name: extract_top_left_2x2
      description: Get the top-left 2x2 of the selection.
    - name: output_result
      description: Output this 2x2 grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Selection Region:** Consider the 3x3 subgrid at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Discard Black Pixels:** Remove any black (value 0) pixels.
3.  **Extract:** Extract the 2x2 subgrid at the top-left corner of the reduced selection.
4.  **Output:** The resulting 2x2 grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
