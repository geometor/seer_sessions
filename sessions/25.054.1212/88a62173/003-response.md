Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was overly specific to the first training example. It focused on finding a 2x2 red square and a specific single red pixel in relation to a white one, which doesn't generalize to the other examples. The core issue is that the code is looking for *absolute* positions and configurations (top-left, bottom-right, specific adjacency) instead of *relative* relationships and generalizable features within 2x2 blocks. It's also got some search conditions that shouldn't be there (like searching for white pixels). The code needs to extract the colors of the top-left 2x2 subgrid within the input grid, and place it in the output grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Simplify the Approach:**  Instead of searching for specific colors and positions, the code should focus on extracting any top-left 2x2 block of any color.
2.  **Generalize Object Identification:**  The code should be able to identify the 2x2 block at position (0,0) regardless of the color.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

I will use code execution to verify the correct output for all 3 train examples and to collect the properties and values for the yaml block.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_grid_properties(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    height, width = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_counts = {color: np.count_nonzero(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}
    top_left_2x2 = grid[0:2, 0:2].tolist()

    return {
        "height": height,
        "width": width,
        "unique_colors": unique_colors.tolist(),
        "color_counts": color_counts,
        "top_left_2x2": top_left_2x2,
    }

# Example Inputs and Outputs (from the prompt)
examples = [
    {
        "input": [
            [0, 2, 0, 0, 2],
            [2, 2, 0, 2, 2],
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 2, 0, 2, 2],
            [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
        ],
        "output": [
            [2, 2],
            [2, 0]
        ]
    },
    {
        "input": [
            [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
            [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
            [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
        ],
        "output": [
            [1, 0],
            [0, 1]
        ]
    },
    {
        "input": [
            [8, 8, 0, 0, 8],
            [8, 0, 0, 8, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
            [8, 0, 0, 8, 0]
        ],
        "output": [
            [8, 8],
            [8, 0]
        ]
    }
]

# Analyze each example
for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    input_props = get_grid_properties(example["input"])
    output_props = get_grid_properties(example["output"])
    print("Input Properties:", input_props)
    print("Output Properties:", output_props)
    print("-" * 20)

```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        height: 5
        width: 5
        top_left_2x2: [[0, 2], [2, 2]]
      output:
        height: 2
        width: 2
        top_left_2x2: [[2, 2], [2, 0]]
  - example_2:
      input:
        height: 5
        width: 5
        top_left_2x2: [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
      output:
        height: 2
        width: 2
        top_left_2x2: [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
  - example_3:
      input:
        height: 5
        width: 5
        top_left_2x2: [[8, 8], [8, 0]]
      output:
        height: 2
        width: 2
        top_left_2x2: [[8, 8], [8, 0]]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Subgrid:** Locate the 2x2 subgrid at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2. **Copy:** The output grid is a direct copy of this 2x2 subgrid.
3. **Output:** The output grid has dimensions of 2x2 and represents the contents of top-left corner of input grid.
