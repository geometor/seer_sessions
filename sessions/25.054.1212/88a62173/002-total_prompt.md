## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 2 0 0 2
2 2 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 2
2 2 0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4890A950>

**output:**
```
2 2
2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC47547340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0 for white, 2 for red). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input grid, focusing on specific regions. The transformation appears to involve some form of object identification (groups of same-colored pixels) and possibly a selection or summarization process. The size reduction and selection criteria are key aspects to figure out.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - values: [0, 2]
      - colors: [white, red]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - values: [0, 2]
      - colors: [white, red]

  - observation: upper_left_2x2_of_output_is_same_color_red
  - observation: lower_right_pixel_of_output_is_white
  - action: identify_top_left_2x2_red_square
    properties:
        - location: input_grid
  - action: identify_bottom_right_white_pixel
    properties:
        - location: near_center_or_within_input_red_square
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the largest contiguous block of red (color 2) pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid.** In this example, it starts from the top-left and extends to form a 2x2 square.
2.  **Extract this 2x2 block.**
3.  **Locate the top-right 2x1 area.**
4.  **Identify if there is 1 single white pixel in the bottom right of the red square.**
5.  **Place the single white pixel in the bottom right of the extracted block.**

Essentially, extract the top-left 2x2 block of red color and the single bottom-right red pixel.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
