The grids contain numerical values, which represent colors (0 for white, 1 for blue). The output seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on specific features or patterns. It appears that the presence and arrangement of blue (1) pixels in the input are crucial for determining the output. The output grid only has blue and white cells, much like the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In a 5x5 grid: Quadrant 1 is top-left 3x3, Quadrant 2 is top-right 3x3, Quadrant 3 is bottom-left 3x3, and Quadrant 4 is the bottom-right 3x3.\n\n2.  **Check for Blue:** For each quadrant, check if there is at least one blue pixel (value 1) present.\n\n3. **Condense to Output**: Each \"quadrant\" of the original image corresponds to one cell in the output.\n  - If the quadrant contains at least one blue pixel, the corresponding output cell should be blue (1).\n  - If a quadrant contains NO blue cells at all (i.e all white pixels), then the corresponding output cell should be white (0).\n4. **Construct output**: Form the 2x2 output grid, setting cells based on the above, where each cell matches the output of step 3.\n\nIn short terms, the output is a 2x2 grid where each cell is blue if the corresponding quadrant in the input has at least one blue cell; otherwise, the cell will be a white one.\n"
