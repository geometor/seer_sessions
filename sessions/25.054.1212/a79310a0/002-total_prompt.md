## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 8 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47F934C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47F93D30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 5x5 grids. The input grid contains a 2x2 block of azure (8) pixels in the top-left corner, with the rest being white (0). The output grid contains a 2x2 block of red (2) pixels, shifted down by one row, with the rest being white (0). The core transformation seems to involve a change in color and position of a square object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: square_1
    type: square
    color: azure
    initial_position: (0,0)
    size: 2x2
  - id: square_2
    type: square
    color: red
    final_position: (1,0)
    size: 2x2
  - id: background
    type: grid
    color: white
    size: 5x5

actions:
  - type: color_change
    subject: square_1
    new_color: red
  - type: move_down
    subject: square_1
    amount: 1

relationships:
   - square_1 is_replaced_by square_2
   - background contains square_1 and square_2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify a 2x2 square of azure pixels in the input grid.
2.  Change the color of this square from azure to red.
3.  Move the now red square down by one row.
4.  The rest of the grid remains unchanged (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
