            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were too specific to the first example. It correctly identified and moved a 2x2 azure square. However, it failed on examples where the azure shape was not a 2x2 square (Example 2: single azure pixel; Example 3: 1x3 azure rectangle). The core issue is an over-generalization from a single example. The strategy needs to be refined to:\n\n1.  **Identify the *general* properties of the azure object being transformed, not just its size in the first example.** The code assumes it's always a 2x2 square, which is incorrect.\n2.  **Account for different starting positions and shapes of the azure object.**\n3.  **Confirm that the color change and downward movement are consistent.**\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a more detailed analysis of each example, incorporating the results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** 5x5 grid, 2x2 azure square at (0,0).\n    *   **Expected Output:** 2x2 red square at (1,0).  Rest of grid is white (0).\n    *   **Actual Output:** Matches Expected.\n    *   **Analysis:** The initial code works perfectly for this case.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** 3x3 grid, single azure pixel at (0, 1).\n    *   **Expected Output:** single red pixel at (1, 1), rest white.\n    *   **Actual Output:** No change.\n    *   **Analysis:** The code failed because it's looking for a 2x2 square, which doesn't exist.  It doesn't handle single-pixel objects or other shapes.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** 5x5 grid, 1x3 azure rectangle at (1, 1).\n    *   **Expected Output:** 1x3 red rectangle at (2, 1), rest white.\n    *   **Actual Output:** No Change.\n    *   **Analysis:** Similar to Example 2, the code fails because the azure object isn't a 2x2 square.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: azure_shape\n    type: contiguous_region\n    color: azure (8)\n    initial_position: variable\n    final_position: one_row_below_initial\n    initial_shape: variable # Could be any shape\n    final_shape: same_as_initial\n  - name: transformed_shape\n    type: contiguous_region\n    color: red (2)\n\nactions:\n  - description: Find the azure shape of any size.\n  - description: Change the color of the azure shape to red.\n  - description: Move the now red shape down by one row, keeping its original dimensions.\n  - description: Keep all other pixels unchanged (white/0).\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This region can be of any size and shape.**\n2.  **Change the color of all pixels within this identified region from azure (8) to red (2).**\n3.  **Move the entire red region down by one row.** The shape and size of the region remain unchanged.\n4.  **All other pixels in the grid that were not part of the original azure region should remain unchanged (white, value 0).**\n"
