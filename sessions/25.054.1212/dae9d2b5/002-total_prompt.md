## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 0 3 3 0
4 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC47FBAB00>

**output:**
```
6 6 0
6 0 0
0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47FB9240>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have yellow (4), green (3), and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has magenta (6) and white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x6). It seems that specific colors in the input grid are mapped to a different color in the output grid, while white remains white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x6
      colors: [0, 3, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x6
      colors: [0, 6]
  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: color_mapping
    type: transformation
    input: input_grid pixel color
    output: output_grid pixel color
    rules:
      - if input_color == 3 or input_color == 4: output_color = 6
      - if input_color == 0: output_color = 0

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
    - type: element-wise
      description: "Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a pixel at the same position in the output grid."
    - type: transformational
      description: colors are replaced according to the color mapping

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Obtain an input grid of dimensions 3x6.
2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Get the color value of the current pixel.
    *   If the color value is 3 (green) or 4 (yellow), change the color to 6 (magenta) at the same position of the output grid.
    *   If the color value is 0 (white), keep the color as 0 (white) in the same position of the output grid.
3.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

In essence, the transformation rule is a simple color substitution: green and yellow pixels are replaced by magenta pixels, while white pixels remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of pixels is preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
