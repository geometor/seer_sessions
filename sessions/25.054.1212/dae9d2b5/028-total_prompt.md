"""
1. **Identify Non-White Regions:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0). In this case find and group all occurrences of colors green (3) and yellow (4).
2. **Downscale and Recenter**: Reduce the grid size down to half the input in x and half the input in y discarding the outer border of 0's.
3. **Consolidate and Recolor:** all non-white colors that are present after downscaling are transformed to 6.
4. **Output:** The result is the 3x3 output grid.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and subsequent code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code captured some aspects of the transformation, specifically identifying non-white pixels and attempting to downscale/recenter. However, the results clearly show discrepancies across multiple examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Recentering/Downscaling:** The logic for determining the center and cropping the relevant region is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle different arrangements of colored pixels.
2.  **Incorrect indexing or offset**: off by one errors can lead to incorrect
    pixel selection.
3.  **Missing Pattern**: examination of correct outputs indicates the intended
    output pattern is the input pattern rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Revisit Recentering:** Instead of trying to calculate a bounding box and center, focus on a simpler approach to define the 3x3 output grid extraction from the original.
2.  **Rotation**: integrate 90 degree rotation.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each modification to ensure it aligns with the expected outputs.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on specific observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Expected Output: A diagonal of '6' from top-left to bottom-right.
    *   Observed Output: Only one '6' in the output.
    *   Issue: Incorrect recentering/downscaling, missing rotation.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Expected Output: '6' values corresponding to original non-white positions, but rotated.
    *   Observed Output: Several incorrect '6' placements.
    *   Issue: Incorrect recentering/downscaling, missing rotation.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Expected Output: Almost entirely filled with '6' values, rotated.
    *   Observed Output: Very few '6's.
    *   Issue: Incorrect recentering/downscaling, missing rotation.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Expected Output: a rotated version of the two color bands, with rotation
    *   Observed Output: All zeros.
    *   Issue: Incorrect cropping - likely discarding all non-zero values, missing rotation.
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Expected Output: a rotated version of the two color bands, with rotation
    *   Observed Output: some correct 6 values.
    *   Issue: Indexing and positioning of the output, missing rotation.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
task_id: 026
observations:
  - type: object_identification
    description: Input grids contain pixels of colors 0 (white), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Non-white pixels are transformed to color 6 (magenta) in the output.
  - type: output_size
    description: The output grid is always 3x3.
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: The non-white colors that are 90 degree clockwise rotation of
      the original input
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid of color values.
2.  **Rotation**: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  **Identify Non-White:** Locate all pixels in the rotated input grid that are not white (0).
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with all zeros (white).
5.  **Map Colors:** For the first 3 rows and 3 columns of the rotated input, map any non-white pixel to the value 6 (magenta) in the corresponding location in the output grid.
6.  **Output:** Return the 3x3 output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
