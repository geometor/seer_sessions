            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial transformation rule correctly identifies the color substitution (green and yellow to magenta, white remains unchanged). However, it fails to account for the change in output grid dimensions. The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids and appear to be cropped based on the locations of the non-white pixels. The strategy will involve identifying the bounding box of the colored pixels in the input grid and applying the color transformation only within that region.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo accurately assess the relationship between input and output grids, I'll analyze each example pair to determine:\n\n1.  **Input Dimensions:** Height and width of the input grid.\n2.  **Output Dimensions:** Height and width of the output grid.\n3.  **Bounding Box:** Top-left and bottom-right coordinates of the smallest rectangle enclosing all non-white pixels in the input.\n4.  **Color Counts (Input & Output):** Number of pixels of each color within the bounding box in both input and output grids.\n\nHere's the analysis performed using the provided examples.\n\n**Example 1**\n*   Input Dimensions: (3, 6)\n*   Output Dimensions: (3, 3)\n*   Bounding Box: ((0, 0), (2, 5))\n*   Color counts is not correct\n\n**Example 2**\n*   Input Dimensions: (3, 6)\n*   Output Dimensions: (3, 3)\n*   Bounding Box: ((0, 0), (2, 5))\n*   Color counts is not correct\n\n**Example 3**\n*   Input Dimensions: (3, 6)\n*   Output Dimensions: (3, 3)\n*   Bounding Box: ((0, 2), (2, 5))\n*   Color counts is not correct\n\n**Example 4**\n*   Input Dimensions: (3, 6)\n*   Output Dimensions: (3, 3)\n*   Bounding Box: ((0, 0), (2, 5))\n*   Color counts is not correct\n\n**Example 5**\n*    Input Dimensions: (3, 6)\n*   Output Dimensions: (3, 3)\n*   Bounding Box: ((0, 4), (2, 5))\n*   Color counts is not correct\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 002\n    facts:\n      - type: object_identification\n        description: The input and output grids contain colored pixels.\n      - type: color_mapping\n        description: Green (3) and Yellow (4) pixels in the input are mapped to Magenta (6) in the output.

This defines the bounding box.\n2.  **Extract Region:** Create a new grid (or slice) from the input grid, encompassing only the area within the bounding box.\n3.  **Color Substitution:** Within this extracted region, replace all green (3) and yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels. White pixels (0) remain unchanged.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting, modified sub-grid is the output.\n"
