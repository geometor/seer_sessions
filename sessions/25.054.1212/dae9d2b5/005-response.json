            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of cropping to a bounding box and performing color substitution was partially correct. However, the cropping logic is flawed. The current implementation crops to *any* non-white pixel, whereas the actual transformation requires cropping to the bounding box defined specifically by the green (3) and yellow (4) pixels, *treating those as a unified object*. The color substitution is correct (green and yellow become magenta), but it should only consider the object itself.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Bounding Box Logic:** Modify the `find_bounding_box` function to specifically target only green (3) and yellow (4) pixels for determining the bounding box.\n2.  **Maintain Color Substitution:** Keep the color substitution logic as is, ensuring it applies only within the refined bounding box.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution Inspired):**\n\nI will analyze some key characteristics without actual code execution by examining the results.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The output is too large - includes parts of input with value `0`.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar error to example 1, parts with value `0` are included.\n*   **Example 3:** The output includes more parts than it should.\n*   **Example 4:** Similar error.\n*   **Example 5:** The output includes extraneous pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"The input grid contains pixels of various colors, including white, green, yellow, and others.\"\n  - description: \"The transformation involves a specific object defined by the union of green and yellow pixels.\"\n  - property: object_colors\n    values: [green, yellow]\n  - property: output_color\n    value: magenta\n  - action: \"A bounding box is determined around the combined green and yellow pixels.\"\n  - action: \"All green and yellow pixels within this bounding box are changed to magenta.\"\n  - action: \"Pixels outside of the defined bounding box are discarded, not included.\"\n  - constraint: \"Only green and yellow define the object.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Object:** Find all pixels that are either green (value 3) or yellow (value 4). Consider these pixels collectively as a single object.\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the bounding box that encompasses *only* the identified green and yellow pixels.\n3.  **Apply Color Transformation:** Within the bounding box, change all green (3) and yellow (4) pixels to magenta (6).\n4.  **Output:** The output grid consists *solely* of the transformed bounding box. Discard any pixels from the input that fall outside this box.\n"
