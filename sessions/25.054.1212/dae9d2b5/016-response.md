"""
The output is a 3x3 grid. The grid is composed of only magenta and white pixels.
The position of the magenta and white pixels is determined by the input grid.
The input grid is interpreted as a 1-dimensional sequence by reading rows
left-to-right, top-to-bottom. The sequence of pixels, excluding zeros, from the
input becomes the sequence of output pixels, starting in the top-left and
reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and replacing the values with 6. The
remaining pixels are set to zero.
