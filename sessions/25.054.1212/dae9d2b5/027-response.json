            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and subsequent code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code captured some aspects of the transformation, specifically identifying non-white pixels and attempting to downscale/recenter. However, the results clearly show discrepancies across multiple examples. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Recentering/Downscaling:** The logic for determining the center and cropping the relevant region is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle different arrangements of colored pixels.\n2.  **Incorrect indexing or offset**: off by one errors can lead to incorrect\n    pixel selection.\n3.  **Missing Pattern**: examination of correct outputs indicates the intended\n    output pattern is the input pattern rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Revisit Recentering:** Instead of trying to calculate a bounding box and center, focus on a simpler approach to define the 3x3 output grid extraction from the original.\n2.  **Rotation**: integrate 90 degree rotation.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each modification to ensure it aligns with the expected outputs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on specific observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Expected Output: A diagonal of '6' from top-left to bottom-right.\n    *   Observed Output: Only one '6' in the output.\n    *   Issue: Incorrect recentering/downscaling, missing rotation.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Expected Output: '6' values corresponding to original non-white positions, but rotated.\n    *   Observed Output: Several incorrect '6' placements.\n    *   Issue: Incorrect recentering/downscaling, missing rotation.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Expected Output: Almost entirely filled with '6' values, rotated.\n    *   Observed Output: Very few '6's.\n    *   Issue: Incorrect recentering/downscaling, missing rotation.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Expected Output: a rotated version of the two color bands, with rotation\n    *   Observed Output: All zeros.\n    *   Issue: Incorrect cropping - likely discarding all non-zero values, missing rotation.\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Expected Output: a rotated version of the two color bands, with rotation\n    *   Observed Output: some correct 6 values.\n    *   Issue: Indexing and positioning of the output, missing rotation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 026\nobservations:\n  - type: object_identification\n    description: Input grids contain pixels of colors 0 (white), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).\n  - type: transformation_rule\n    description: Non-white pixels are transformed to color 6 (magenta) in the output.\n  - type: output_size\n    description: The output grid is always 3x3.\n  - type: spatial_relationship\n    description: The non-white colors that are 90 degree clockwise rotation of\n      the original input\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid of color values.\n2.  **Rotation**: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n3.  **Identify Non-White:** Locate all pixels in the rotated input grid that are not white (0).\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with all zeros (white).\n5.  **Map Colors:** For the first 3 rows and 3 columns of the rotated input, map any non-white pixel to the value 6 (magenta) in the corresponding location in the output grid.\n6.  **Output:** Return the 3x3 output grid.\n"
