Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple color substitution: green and yellow pixels are replaced by magenta pixels, while white pixels remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of pixels is preserved.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid by replacing green (3) and yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels,
    while keeping white (0) pixels unchanged.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            # Apply the color substitution rules.
            if output_grid[i, j] == 3 or output_grid[i, j] == 4:
                output_grid[i, j] = 6
            elif output_grid[i, j] == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = 0  # Redundant, but kept for clarity.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
