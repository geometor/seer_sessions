  - task_id: "014"
  - input_objects:
    - description: "Variable number of objects of different colors and sizes."
      properties:
        - colors: [0, 1, 5, 7]  # white, blue, grey, orange
        - shapes: "Mostly single-pixel objects, some larger contiguous blocks."
  - output_objects:
      properties:
        - colors: [0,3] # white and green
        - shape: "Always three columns wide, height matches input."
        - columns: "Three distinct columns."
  - actions:
      - description: "Column Reduction"
        details: "The input grid's columns are reduced to three columns in the output."
      - description: "Color Mapping"
        details: "Input color patterns determine output colors based on position relative to vertical blue line."
  - key_features:
      - description: "Vertical Blue Line"
        details: "A full-height vertical line of blue (color 1) acts as a separator and its column in the input maps directly to a column of the same height in the output."
      - description: "Column Grouping and Reduction"
        details: "input columns 0,1,2 is reduced to output column 0. Columns to the right of the blue line are reduced to a single column at output column index 2. The blue line maps to column index 1."
