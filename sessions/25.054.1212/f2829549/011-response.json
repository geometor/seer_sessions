            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial attempt at creating a checkerboard pattern based on the input grid failed to correctly identify the size of the output grid and the checkerboard pattern itself. The code attempts to infer the checkerboard colors from a 2x2 block in the input, but the implementation of finding the correct width, and applying the color pattern is not always correct. A more robust method is needed to construct and verify the checkerboard.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve Size Detection:** Focus on the relationship between input and output grid dimensions. Use all provided input/output examples to better deduce the relationship.\n2.  **Refine Checkerboard Logic:**\n    *   The current checkerboard color detection is too simplistic. It only checks the first 2x2 region.\n    *   The code needs to reliably distinguish which color is the \"starting\" color in the checkerboard.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_shape: [4, 7]\n    output_shape: [4, 3]\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    checkerboard_present: true\n    checkerboard_colors: [7,5]\n    notes: \"Output width is input_height - 1, checkerboard is green and white.\"\n  - id: 2\n    input_shape: [4, 7]\n    output_shape: [4, 3]\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    checkerboard_present: true\n    checkerboard_colors: [7,5]\n    notes: \"Output width is input_height - 1, checkerboard is green and white.\"\n  - id: 3\n    input_shape: [4, 7]\n    output_shape: [4, 3]\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    checkerboard_present: true\n    checkerboard_colors: [7, 5]\n    notes: \"Output width is input_height - 1, checkerboard is green and white\"\n  - id: 4\n    input_shape: [4, 7]\n    output_shape: [4, 3]\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    checkerboard_present: true\n    checkerboard_colors: [7, 5]\n    notes: \"Output width is input_height - 1, checkerboard is green and white\"\n  - id: 5\n    input_shape: [4, 7]\n    output_shape: [4, 3]\n    output_colors: [0, 3]\n    checkerboard_present: true\n    checkerboard_colors: [7,5]\n    notes: \"Output width is input_height - 1, checkerboard is green and white.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's height is the same as the input grid's height. The output grid's width is one less than the input grid height.\n\n2.  **Checkerboard Pattern**: The output is a checkerboard. Create a checkerboard using the output height and width, alternating white (0) and green (3). The top-left cell of the checkerboard will always be white (0).\n"
