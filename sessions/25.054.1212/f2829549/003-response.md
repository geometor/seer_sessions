Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to improve the transformation description:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding of the transformation, focusing solely on the first example. It correctly identified the column containing '1's (blue) and attempted to change them to '3's (green). However, it failed to account for:
1. the final size of the output is supposed to be smaller and has an clear relation with the column position of the value '1'
2.  the position of the '3' in the output

The strategy for improvement involves:

1.  **Refining the Output Size Logic:** Incorporate the relationship between the column index of the '1's and the dimensions of the output grid.
2.  **Correcting '3' Placement:** Ensure the '3's are placed in the correct output column, not always in the last column of the output.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of each example, highlighting key observations:

| Example | Input Size | Output Size | '1' Column |  '3' position |  Errors   |
| :-----: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    1    |    7x4     |    4x3      |     3      |   (i,2)  | Output size incorrect, '3' position incorrect.                             |
|    2    |    7x4     |    4x3      |     3      |   (i,2)  |  Output size incorrect, '3' position incorrect.                                   |
|    3    |    7x4     |    4x3     |     3      |   (i,2)  |   Output size incorrect, '3' position incorrect.                                      |
|    4    |    7x4     |    4x3     |    3       |   (i,2)  |   Output size incorrect, '3' position incorrect.                                    |
|    5    |    7x4     |    4x3     |     3       |   (i,2)     | Output size incorrect, '3' position incorrect.                       |

**Key Observations from all Examples:**
* the position of the column with '1' seems to be the only relevant property of the input
* The output grid's height always matches the input grid's height.
* The output grid's width is related to the position of '1' in the input grid. For all these examples, if the column containing 1 is j, the output width = input_width - (j).
* Only cells containing '1' in the input are transformed to '3' in the output.
* The row index of the '3's in the output matches the row index of the '1's in the input.
* The output column is allways the width of the output minus 1.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: same as input_grid height
      width: input_grid width - index of column with '1'
      elements: integers (0, 3)
  - object: transformation_rule
    type: conditional replacement
    conditions:
      - if input_grid[row, col] == 1:
          then: output_grid[row, output_width -1] = 3
      - else: output_grid[row, col] = 0
    constraints:
      output_width: input_grid.width - j  # where j is the index of the column containing '1's
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Blue Column:** Identify the index (`j`) of the column in the input grid that contains the value '1' (blue).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid has the same height as the input grid.
    *   The output grid's width is calculated as: `input_width` - `j`.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid filled with '0' (white) with the calculated dimensions.
4.  **Transform Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid:
    *   If a cell's value is '1' (blue):
        *   Place a '3' (green) in the output grid at the same row and in the last column ( output\_width -1 ).
    *   All other input values are discarded. The output grid remains '0' where no '1' was found in the corresponding input row.

This program provides a complete and more accurate description that can be used to generate improved code. The next phase is testing the code.
