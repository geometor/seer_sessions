Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger (7x4) than the output grid (4x3). There's a noticeable change in colors and a reduction in the dimensions of the grid. Specific colors seem to be targeted and replaced, while others disappear completely. The spatial arrangement of the remaining pixels after the transformation also seems important. The colors present are Orange (7), Blue (1), Gray (5), white (0), and Green(3)

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 7x4, output grid is 4x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0, 1, 5, and 7.
  - observation: Output grid contains only color 3 and 0.
  - observation: Color 1 in the input seems to correspond to the position of 3 in output. The Column of '1' is at x = 3 and output is 4 x 3.
  - observation: All 1s in the input are transformed to 3s in the output.
  - observation: All 7s and 5s are eliminated.
  - observation: Remaining spaces seem to be all 0.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Column:** Locate the column in the input grid that contains the value '1' (blue).
2.  **Construct Output Dimensions:** Create an output grid where The number of row is equals to the number of rows in input. The number of Columns is equals to the Column Number that contains 1,
3.  **Transform Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid.
    *   If a pixel's value is '1', change it to '3' (green) and place it in the output grid and the same row.
    *   If a pixel's value is '7' or '5', discard it (do not include it in the output).
    *   Fill remaining positions in output will 0.
