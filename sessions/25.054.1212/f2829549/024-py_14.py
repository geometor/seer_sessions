1.  **Input and Output:** The input is a 4x7 grid, and the output is a 4x3 grid.
2.  **Row-wise Transformation:** For each row in the input grid, the output grid's corresponding row is determined solely by the first three columns of the input row.
3.  **Column-Specific Transformation:**
    *   The first column of the output grid is always white (0).
    *   The second column of the output grid is always white (0).
    *   The third column of the output grid is always green (3).
