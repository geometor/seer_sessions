There are distinct horizontal bands of colors. Orange (7), white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) are present.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 4x3 grid, smaller than the input. It contains only white (0) and green (3). The green appears to correspond to the locations of orange and blue in the input, but is not a simple 1-1 replacement.\n* **Transformation:** The output grid's dimensions (4x3) appear connected to the input. The height matches, and the width seems to be derived somehow. The output colors don't directly map to the input colors; there seems to be a selection or summarization process. The green (3) color is NOT present in the input, this is important. The output grid height matches the input. The width has decreased by more than half.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
