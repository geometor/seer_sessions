Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Find the Blue Column: Identify the index (`j`) of the column in the input grid that contains the value '1' (blue).
2.  Determine Output Dimensions:
    *   The output grid has the same height as the input grid.
    *   The output grid's width is calculated as: `input_width` - `j`.
3.  Create Output Grid: Initialize an output grid filled with '0' (white) with the calculated dimensions.
4.  Transform Pixels: Iterate through each cell of the input grid:
    *   If a cell's value is '1' (blue):
        *   Place a '3' (green) in the output grid at the same row and in the last column ( output_width -1 ).
    *   All other input values are discarded. The output grid remains '0' where no '1' was found in the corresponding input row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
