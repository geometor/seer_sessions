The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: an upper region with green (3) and white (0) pixels, and a lower region with blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid is smaller and mostly white (0), with two red (2) pixels appearing in specific locations. The positions of the red pixels in the output seem to correspond to the positions of color changes (from 0 to 3) within the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Initialize all cells of output grid to 0 (white).\n2. **Input Grid Halving:** Consider only the top half of the input grid.\n3. **Scan Input Top-Half:** Iterate through each row of the top half of the input grid.\n4. **Horizontal Transition Detection:** Within each row from step 3, from left-to-right, check for a color transition from 0 (white) to 3 (green).\n5. **Mark Output:** If a 0-to-3 transition is detected at position (row, col) in input, set the value of the output grid at position (row, col) to 2 (red).\n6. **Output:** Return the modified output grid.\n\nIn essence, the program detects horizontal transitions from white to green in the top half of the input grid and marks those locations with red in a smaller output grid. The bottom half of input is ignored.\n"
