"""
1.  **Divide Input:** Split the input grid into two sections. Section 1 consists of all rows from the top of the grid up to and including the last row that begins with a digit other than 0 or 1. Section 2 consists of all rows below Section 1.
2.  **Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as Section 1 of the input grid.
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with 0s, with the dimensions determined in step 2.
4.  **Map Section 2 to Output:** Iterate through each cell of Section 2. If a cell's value is 0, and its row and column indices are within the bounds of Section 1's dimensions, then change the value of the cell at the same row and column in the output grid to 2.
5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.
