The first section goes from the top of the grid until the last row that starts with a non-zero and non-one number. In the provided data this is row index `0` to `3`. The next section starts from first row that begins with either `0` or `1` until the end of the grid.\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the first identified section of the input.\n3. **Locate Critical Input Cell** Find the `0` in first section of input grid which is surrounded by most `3`s, including diagonals.\n4.  **Check Corresponding Cell in Second Section**: Check value in second section of input with same coordinates as `0` identified in previous step. If this value is `1`, this is location of non-zero value `2` for the output grid.\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of the determined size, filled with 0s.\n6. **Find matching coordinate** Find the coordinates in input grid top section where value is `0` AND surrounded by maximum number of `3` AND the same coordinates in bottom section contains a `1`.\n7.  **Populate Output:** Place a `2` in the output grid at the coordinates of `0` found in previous step. All other cells in the output grid remain 0.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_sections(grid):\n    # split the grid into two sections based on row starting value\n    rows = len(grid)\n    section1_end_row = 0\n\n    # Section 1 ends last row before a row starts with 0 or 1.\n    for r in range(rows):\n      if grid[r][0] == 0 or grid[r][0] == 1:\n        section1_end_row = r\n        break\n\n    section1 = grid[:section1_end_row]\n    section2 = grid[section1_end_row:]\n\n    return np.array(section1), np.array(section2)\n\ndef count_surrounding(grid, r, c, value):\n    # count surrounding cells with given value, including diagonals\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for i in range(max(0, r - 1), min(rows, r + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, c - 1), min(cols, c + 2)):\n            if (i != r or j != c) and grid[i][j] == value:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # get sections \n    section1, section2 = get_sections(input_grid)\n    \n    # initialize the output_grid with zeros and size of section1\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(section1)\n\n    rows, cols = section1.shape\n    max_threes = -1\n    target_row, target_col = -1, -1\n    \n    # find zero cell in section 1 with most surrounding threes\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if section1[r][c] == 0:\n              num_threes = count_surrounding(section1, r, c, 3)\n              if num_threes > max_threes:\n                #check second grid contains a 1 at same position\n                if section2.size > 0 and section2[r][c] == 1:\n                  max_threes = num_threes\n                  target_row, target_col = r, c\n\n    # set the corresponding cell in output_grid to 2\n    if target_row != -1 and target_col != -1:\n      output_grid[target_row][target_col] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
