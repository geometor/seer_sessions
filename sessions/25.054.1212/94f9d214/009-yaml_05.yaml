summary: |
    The task involves reducing an input grid to create output grid of half the width and half the height by consolidating 2x2 sections.
    Red (2) regions depends on the presence of Green (3) or Blue(1) inside input sub-grids.
    If Green or Blue are present, under certain condition a red pixel is placed in the corresponding output coordinate.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: The initial grid of varying size, containing pixels of different colors.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: The transformed grid, half the height and width of the input grid, containing mostly white and some red pixels.
  - name: sub_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: 2x2 regions of input_grid considered during transformation.

colors:
  - 0: white
  - 1: blue
  - 2: red
  - 3: green

    type: reduction and conditional replacement
    description: >
      The input grid is processed in 2x2 subgrids.
      The output grid is created with dimensions (height/2, width/2).
      If a subgrid contains a green (3) pixel, the corresponding output pixel is red (2).
      If no green pixel, but a blue (1) exists, the output pixel is red (2).
      Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).
