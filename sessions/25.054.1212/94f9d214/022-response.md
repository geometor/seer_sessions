"""
1. **Identify Input Sections:** Divide the input grid into two sections. The first section goes from the top of the grid until the last row that starts with a non-zero and non-one number. The second section is all rows below.
2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the first identified section of the input.
3. **Locate Critical Input Cell in Section 1** Find the `0` in first section of input grid.
4.  **Check Corresponding Cell in Section 2**: Find all `0`s in the second section.
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of the determined size, filled with 0s.
6. **Populate output based on section 2**: for each `0` cell in section 2. if the row and col are within the dimensions of section 1, change value to `2`
7.  **Return:** The output grid.
