            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of splitting the input grid into two sections based on the first row containing 0 or 1 was a reasonable starting point but is not entirely accurate for all cases. The core idea of using one section to determine the size and another to determine pixel placement has merit, but the specific criteria for splitting and placement are flawed. The code is not correctly identifying the corresponding locations between Section 2 and Section 1. The examples show various failures, mainly related to incorrect output size and pixel placement, so an improved method of identifying boundaries between sections and improved pixel mapping is required.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Section Splitting:** The current method of splitting based on the first row's starting value is not reliable. We need a more robust way to define the sections, potentially considering the entire structure or patterns within the grid. It seems the split must be based on the last row where the first element is NOT `0` or `1`.\n2.  **Refine Pixel Mapping:** The current logic only checks for `0` in section 2 and uses it's coordinate to populate section 1 with a `2`. Need to consider values of section 1.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Analyze each example's failure points carefully. Use the insights to adjust both the natural language program and the corresponding code. We might need to introduce concepts like \"finding corresponding regions\" rather than just direct coordinate mapping.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere, I will construct reports using conceptual analysis, as I cannot directly execute code. The reports aim to be as accurate as possible given the visual data.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 8x4\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 4x4\n*   **Transformed Output Size:** 0x0\n*   **Section 1 end row (current logic):** Row 4 (incorrect)\n*   **Section 1 end row (correct):** Row 4\n*   **Pixel Mapping Analysis:** The algorithm failed to produce any output, so pixel mapping wasn't performed correctly. It should have mapped the 0s at (4,1), (6,1) and (7,0), (7,2) of Section 2 to (0,1), (2,1) and(3,0), (3,2) in Section 1 and set to 2.\n*   **Notes:** The output is wrong, but section split is correct.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 8x4\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 4x4\n*   **Transformed Output Size:** 1x4\n*   **Section 1 end row (current logic):** Row 4 (incorrect)\n*   **Section 1 end row (correct):** Row 4\n*   **Pixel Mapping Analysis:**\n    Incorrect output size. It only printed first row correctly\n*   **Notes:** The output is wrong, but section split is correct.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 8x4\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 4x4\n*   **Transformed Output Size:** 0x0\n*   **Section 1 end row (current logic):** Row 4 (incorrect)\n*    **Section 1 end row (correct):** Row 4\n*   **Pixel Mapping Analysis:** The algorithm failed completely. It seems to recognize section 2 correctly, but fails to produce output.\n*   **Notes:** The output is wrong, but section split is correct.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 8x4\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 4x4\n*   **Transformed Output Size:** 4x4\n*   **Section 1 end row (current logic):** Row 4 (incorrect)\n*   **Section 1 end row (correct):** Row 4\n*   **Pixel Mapping Analysis:** Correct Size but incorrect pixel location. Only 3 pixels placed incorrectly, the rest correct.\n*   **Notes:** Size correct, pixel placement error.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: '022'\n  - objects:\n    - name: input_grid\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)\n        - values: integers (0-9)\n    - name: output_grid\n      type: grid\n      properties:\n        - dimensions: determined by input_grid section 1\n        - values: integers (0-9), predominantly 0 and 2\n    - name: section1\n      type: subgrid\n      properties:\n          - source: input_grid\n          - boundary: \"rows up to last row starting with value other than 0 or 1\"\n    - name: section2\n      type: subgrid\n      properties:\n          - source: input_grid\n          - boundary: \"rows below section1\"\n  - actions:\n    - name: split_grid\n      description: Divide the input grid into two sections.\n    - name: determine_output_size\n      description: Set the output grid size equal to Section 1 size\n    - name: map_pixels\n      description: \"Find 0 cells in Section 2. If corresponding coordinates are within Section 1 bounds, set the cell in output grid to 2.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Divide Input:** Split the input grid into two sections. Section 1 consists of all rows from the top of the grid up to and including the last row that begins with a digit other than 0 or 1. Section 2 consists of all rows below Section 1.\n2.  **Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as Section 1 of the input grid.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with 0s, with the dimensions determined in step 2.\n4.  **Map Section 2 to Output:** Iterate through each cell of Section 2. If a cell's value is 0, and its row and column indices are within the bounds of Section 1's dimensions, then change the value of the cell at the same row and column in the output grid to 2.\n5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.\n"
