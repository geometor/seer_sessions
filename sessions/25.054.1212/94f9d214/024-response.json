Section 1 consists of all rows from the top of the grid up to and including the last row that begins with a digit other than 0 or 1. Section 2 consists of all rows below Section 1.\n2.  **Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as Section 1 of the input grid.\n3.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with 0s, with the dimensions determined in step 2.\n4.  **Map Section 2 to Output:** Iterate through each cell of Section 2. If a cell's value is 0, and its row and column indices are within the bounds of Section 1's dimensions, then change the value of the cell at the same row and column in the output grid to 2.\n5.  **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_sections(grid):\n    # split the grid into two sections based on row starting value\n    rows = len(grid)\n    section1_end_row = 0\n\n    # Section 1 ends at last row before a row starts with 0 or 1.\n    for r in range(rows):\n      if grid[r][0] == 0 or grid[r][0] == 1:\n        section1_end_row = r\n        break\n\n    section1 = grid[:section1_end_row]\n    section2 = grid[section1_end_row:]\n\n    return np.array(section1), np.array(section2)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # get sections\n    section1, section2 = get_sections(input_grid)\n    \n    # initialize the output_grid with zeros and size of section1\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(section1)\n\n    rows1, cols1 = section1.shape\n    rows2, cols2 = section2.shape\n\n    # iterate through section 2\n    for r in range(rows2):\n        for c in range(cols2):\n            # if a cell in section2 is 0\n            if section2[r][c] == 0:\n                # and those coordinates are within section1\n                if r < rows1 and c < cols1:\n                  # set section 1 cell to 2\n                  output_grid[r][c] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
