facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x4 (height x width).
  - observation: Output grid is 4x4 (height x width).
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0 (white) and 2 (red).
  - object: Input_Grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 8
      width: 4
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
  - object: Output_Grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 4
      colors: [0, 2]
  - action: extract_color_transitions
    input: Input_Grid
    description: Identifies positions where the color changes horizontally (left-to-right) from 0 to 3 in the top half and marks corresponding positions with color 2 (red) on the output grid.
  - relationship: Output_Grid size is a function of Input_Grid top half size. Specifically, height is half of input, width the same.
  - relationship: Red pixels in Output_Grid corresponds to color change from white to green on the top half of the input.
