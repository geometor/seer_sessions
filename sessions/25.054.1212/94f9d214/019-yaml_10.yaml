facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: [0, 1, 3]
      sections:
          - top_left: [0,0]
            top_right: [0,3]
            bottom_left: [3,0]

            bottom_left: [7,0]
            bottom_right: [7,3]
            values: [0,1]

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: [0, 2]
      size: matches input_grid top section dimensions

  - observation: single_non_zero_output
    description: The output grid contains only one non-zero value (2).

  - observation: input has two segments
    description: top segment is 4x4, bottom segment starts on row 5 and is also 4x4

  - relationship: output_size_matches_input_section1
    description: The dimensions of the output grid are the same as the dimensions of first section of the input grid.

  - relationship: non_zero_position_relates
    description: position of the `2` is related to a `0` in first section of input that has `3`s surrounding it and a corresponding `1` in that location in the second input section
