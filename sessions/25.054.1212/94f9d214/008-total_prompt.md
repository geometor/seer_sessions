## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3
0 3 3 0
0 0 3 3
3 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x512 at 0x7BFC48A621A0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0
2 0 0 0
0 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC48A607F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 0, 1, and 3 (white, blue, and green). The output grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 0 and 2 (white and red). The output grid is smaller in dimensions (4x4) compared to the input grid (8x4). There is a clear reduction and color change. The positions of non-white pixels also change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
      - dimensions: 8x4
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2] # white, red
      - dimensions: 4x4
  - name: green_object
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 3
      - initial_shape: irregular
      - final_color: 0 #becomes white/disappears.
  - name: blue_object
    type: object
    properties:
       - color: 1
       - initial_shape: irregular
       - final_color: 0 #becomes white/disappears
  - name: white_background
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 0
      - role: background # Stays white, serves as background
  - name: red_object
    type: object
    properties:
       -color: 2
       -initial_color: none
       -shape: irregular

actions:
  - type: dimension_reduction
    description: Input grid transforms into a smaller output grid.
  - type: color_change_and_reposition
    description:  some white pixels in the input are becoming red pixels in the reduced output grid
  - type: disappearance
    description: some colored object disappear.

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: [green_object, blue_object, white_background]
  - output_grid_contains: [red_object, white_background]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Reduction:** The input grid (8x4) is reduced to an output grid (4x4). The reduction is performed by taking 2x1 blocks of the input and making them a single pixel.

2.  **Disappearance:** The blue and the green regions disappear

3. **Red Region Creation:** The red regions are created on the output grid based on following this algorithm:
   *   Iterate every 2 rows, for every 4 columns on each row.
   *   If any of the pixel with value 3 (green) is detected within that 2 x 4 sub-grid, put a red pixel (value 2) at the coordinate of the input sub-grid divided by 2.
   *   if any pixel with value 1 is detected, and no pixel with value 3 is detected, and the blue pixel is the last value within that block, put a red pixel with value 2 at the top left coordinate of the input subgrid divided by 2.
4. **Background:** The white background (0) remains unchanged where there are no red pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
