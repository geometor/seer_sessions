observations:
  - example_set: Training Examples
    input:
      object_type: 2D Grid
      data_type: Integer (0-9, representing colors)
      dimensions: Variable (rows x cols)
      min_dimension: 4 x 4 # based on current set
      max_dimension: 8 x 4 # based on current set
    output:
      object_type: 2D Grid
      data_type: Integer (0-9, representing colors)
      dimensions: Variable (rows x cols) - related to, but not a simple function of, input dimensions
    transformations:
      - type: Subgrid Processing
