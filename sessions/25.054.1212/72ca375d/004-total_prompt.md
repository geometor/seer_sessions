1. Identify the Target Color: The program focuses on a single color within the input grid, in this instance magenta (represented by the digit 6).
2. Locate the Bounding Box: Determine the smallest rectangular area that encloses all pixels of the target color (magenta) in the input grid. Note the row and column of the upper-left and lower right pixels.
3. Extract the area: Create the ouput grid that represents a cropped view of the input grid, using the coordinates of the bounding box identified in step 2, filled with the pixels of the target color.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly handled the first example, where the magenta (6) region was the target. However, it failed on examples 2 and 3. The core issue is that the code *always* targets color 6 (magenta), regardless of the input. It doesn't dynamically determine which color to extract. The examples show that we need a more general approach to select the target object color.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Identify the correct target color:** Instead of hardcoding `target_color = 6`, we need to infer the target color from each input-output pair.
2.  **Maintain Bounding Box Logic:** The `find_bounding_box` function is conceptually correct and should be kept.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including more detailed observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x10
    *   Output Shape: 2x4
    *   Target Color (Expected): Magenta (6)
    *   Transformation Result: Correct. The code correctly extracted the magenta region.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x10
    *   Output Shape: 2x2
    *   Target Color (Expected): Blue (4)
    *    Transformation Result: the code returned an empty list because no magenta pixels where in the input
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x10
    *   Output Shape: 2x4
    *   Target Color (Expected): Gray (5)
    *    Transformation Result: the code returned an empty list because no magenta pixels where in the input

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: blue (2)
        shape: irregular
        position: (1,1)
      - color: green (3)
        shape: irregular
        position: (2,2)
      - color: grey(7)
        shape: irregular
        position: (2,7)
      - color: magenta (6)
        shape: rectangle
        position: (6,3)
    output_objects:
      - color: magenta (6)
        shape: rectangle
        position: (0,0) # Relative to output grid
    action: extract_magenta_rectangle

  - id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: blue(4)
        shape: rectangle
        position: (1,2)
      - color: azure(8)
        shape: irregular
        position: (2,6)
       - color: red(2)
        shape: irregular
        position: (7,2)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue(4)
        shape: rectangle
        position: (0,0)
    action: extract_blue_rectangle

  - id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: green(3)
        shape: irregular
        position: (1,1)
      - color: grey(5)
        shape: rectangle
        position: (2,5)
      - color: azure(8)
        shape: irregular
        position: (7,3)
    output_objects:
      - color: grey(5)
        shape: rectangle
        position: (0,0)
    action: extract_grey_rectangle

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Target Color:** Examine the expected output grid. The target color is the color present in the output.
2.  **Locate Bounding Box in Input:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the *input* grid that contains all pixels of the target color determined in Step 1.
3.  **Extract the Region:** Create a new grid containing only the pixels within the bounding box from the input grid. This extracted region is the output.

This revised program addresses the primary flaw of the original – the hardcoded target color – and correctly describes the transformation process for all three training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
