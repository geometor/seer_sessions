The input grid contains several distinct colored regions, while the output grid seems to represent only one of these regions. The colors in the output are the same as in the input. The output size appears substantially smaller than the input size. The most notable aspect is the selection of a specific colored object.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
