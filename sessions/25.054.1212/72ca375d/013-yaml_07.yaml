facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - width: 10
      - height: 10
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - width: 4
      - height: 2
  - observation: color_focus
    value: 5 (gray)
    description: The output grid only contains pixels of color 5 and 0.
  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: The arrangement of the '5' pixels in the output grid corresponds to the arrangement of a subset of '5' pixels within the input grid. The shape of the gray object is maintained.
  - observation: dimension_change
    description: output grid dimensions are not directly related by a simple scaling factor to the input grid.
