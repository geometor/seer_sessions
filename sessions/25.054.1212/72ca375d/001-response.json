The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid seems to be a selective extraction or summary of a specific color region from the input grid. Specifically, the magenta (6) region in the input is isolated in the output. The output grid's dimensions correspond to the bounding box of just the magenta shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note the row and column of the upper-left and lower right pixels.\n3. **Extract the area:** Create the ouput grid that represents a cropped view of the input grid, using the coordinates of the bounding box identified in step 2, filled with the pixels of the target color.\n\nIn summary, the transformation isolates a specific colored shape (magenta in this instance) from the input grid and presents it as a separate, smaller grid, effectively cropping to the bounding box of the target color.\n"
