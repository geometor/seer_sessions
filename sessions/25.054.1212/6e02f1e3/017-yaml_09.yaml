observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors
    actions:
      - transformed: based on a rule involving the diagonal and possibly other input pixel values

  - object: diagonal
    properties:
      - definition: cells where row index equals column index
    actions:
      - set_color: color is dependent on input

  - object: other_cells
    properties:
      - definition: cells not on the diagonal
    actions:
      - preserve_color: color does not appear to be dependent on input
