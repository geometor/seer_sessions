The input grid contains colors represented by numbers (3, 4, 2 - green, yellow, red), while the output grid uses different numbers (0, 5 - white, gray).  The transformation doesn't seem to simply map one color to another directly (e.g., green isn't always becoming white). It's likely a conditional transformation based on the color and/or position of the pixels. There's a noticeable change in the color set.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
