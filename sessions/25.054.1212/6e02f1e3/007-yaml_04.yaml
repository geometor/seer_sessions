facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [3, 4, 2] # Green, Yellow, Red
    output_colors: [0, 5]    # White, Gray
  - observation: "The transformation is not a simple one-to-one color mapping."
  - observation: "The output grid only consists of two colors, 0 and 5, where the original had 3, 4, 2."
  - relationship: input_grid -> output_grid
  - transformation_type: conditional
