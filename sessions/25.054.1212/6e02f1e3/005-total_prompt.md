## Example 1:

Expected Output:
```
None
```
match: None
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None
color_palette_correct: None
correct_pixel_counts: None
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for moving forward, documented facts, and a natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code only analyzes the examples; it doesn't actually implement any transformation. The `transformed` output in the examples seems to be manually created and sometimes *incorrect*, judging by the `expected` output. This makes the analysis misleading. My primary goal is to understand the *actual* transformation rule by observing the input and *expected* output pairs. The provided "transformed" outputs are unreliable and should be disregarded.

The initial strategy is to:

1.  **Ignore 'transformed'**: Focus solely on `input` and `expected` output pairs.
2.  **Identify a Consistent Pattern**: Look for relationships between input and expected output across *all* examples.  The previous assumption that only one example was sufficient was overly optimistic.
3.  **Formulate a Simple Rule**: Start with the simplest possible explanation, and only add complexity if necessary.
4. **Develop Code:** Implement the natural language program in python.

**Metrics and Observations (Ignoring 'transformed')**

I will manually review the examples to generate metrics to develop the reports. No code execution is necessary.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid of 2s and 3s.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid of 5s and 0s. 5s appear where the input had either a 2 or a 3. 0 appears where there were no original values, forming a cross pattern.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid of 3s, 4s, and 2s.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid of 5s and 0s. 5 appears to replace any non-zero input.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid of all 4s.
    *   Expected Output: Top row is all 5. Others are 0.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid of all 3s.
    *   Expected Output: Top row is all 5, others are 0.
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with 4s in the top two rows and 3s on the bottom row
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 of 5 and 0.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      All inputs are 3x3 grids.
  - observation: |
      All outputs are 3x3 grids.
  - observation: |
    Input grids contain values between 2 and 4 inclusive.
  - observation: |
    Output grids contain only values 0 and 5.
  - observation: |
    In some examples, all non-zero input colors are changed to 5 in
    specific positions.
  - observation: |
     In examples 3 and 4, only the first row is 5 and the rest is 0.
  - observation: |
     Examples 1, 2, and 5 show a cross pattern, with the output as 5.
  - action: |
      Non-zero input pixels are replaced with 5, and 0 is placed to form a cross pattern.
  - exception_rows: |
    If the input grid consists of all the same color, only the top row becomes 5 and the other pixels are zero.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Check for Uniform Input:** If all pixels in the input grid have the same color, create an output grid where the top row is all 5s, and all other pixels are 0s.
2. **Cross Pattern**: Otherwise, create an output where any non-zero input produces a 5 and zeros are placed between to form a cross.

This two-part rule covers all observed examples, handling the "all same color" cases as a special condition.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
