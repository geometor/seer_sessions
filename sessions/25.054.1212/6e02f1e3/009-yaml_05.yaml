  - name: diagonal
    type: pattern
    properties:

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    precondition:
      - "if cell color is 3 or 4, output is always 0"
      - "if all input cell colors are the same, then all output cell colors are 0"
      - "if cell color is 2, output may be 5"
    postcondition:
       - "output cell can be 0 or 5"

  - name: transform_diagonal
    precondition:
       - "cell is on the top-left to bottom-right diagonal"
    postcondition:
        - "output cell color is 5 if input was 2 and no color was repeated 9 times"
