## Example 5

**input:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A0460>

**output:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A38B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. Two rows of yellow (4) pixels and one row of green (3) pixels.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid. The diagonal is gray (5), and all other pixels are white (0).
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - row_1: [4, 4, 4]
      - row_2: [4, 4, 4]
      - row_3: [3, 3, 3]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - diagonal: [5, 5, 5]
      - other_cells: 0
  - action: create_diagonal
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Sets the main diagonal of the output grid to gray (5) and all other cells to white(0). The dimensions stay the same.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program takes a 3x3 input grid and creates a 3x3 output grid. The main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the output grid is set to gray (5), while all other cells in the output grid are set to white (0). The content of the input grid doesn't affect the output grid, only the dimensions matter, in which they are the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
