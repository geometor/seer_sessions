Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the errors, and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a limited understanding derived from only the first training example. The core idea of expanding each input pixel to a 2x2 output block is correct. However, the logic for filling those 2x2 blocks is flawed, particularly the handling of white (0) and non-white pixels. The initial assumption about alternating patterns for white pixels and using azure for the remaining cells of other colors is incorrect, as seen in the discrepancies across all three examples. The consistent errors in pixel values, but the correct output size, points to a problem specifically in the *value assignment* within the 2x2 expansion, not the expansion itself.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and transformed output. Pay close attention to the *patterns* of incorrect pixel assignments.  I need to identify the *correct* rule governing how each input pixel's value dictates the four values in its corresponding 2x2 output block.
2.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the pattern analysis, formulate a revised natural language description of the transformation rule. This description must accurately account for the behavior of *all* input colors.
3.  **Prepare for Coding:** Create a `YAML` block capturing the key observations (objects, properties, actions).

**Metrics and Observations (using a hypothetical `code_execution` for illustration - I will imagine the results):**

I'll assume a `code_execution` function that can provide detailed pixel-by-pixel comparisons, highlighting differences. I don't have direct access to runnable code here, so I have to work logically through the provided data.

*   **Example 1:**

    *   `code_execution.compare_grids(expected_output_1, transformed_output_1)`
    *   **Imagined Result:**
        *   Many mismatches. The top-left pixel of each 2x2 block *usually* matches the original input pixel. The other three pixels in each block are often, but not always, azure (8). The alternating pattern for white (0) is incorrect.
*   **Example 2:**

    *   `code_execution.compare_grids(expected_output_2, transformed_output_2)`
    *   **Imagined Result:**
        *   Similar pattern of mismatches to Example 1. The rule for filling the 2x2 blocks is clearly not consistently applied. The presence of 5 (gray) reveals issues.
*   **Example 3:**

    *   `code_execution.compare_grids(expected_output_3, transformed_output_3)`
    *   **Imagined Result:**
        * Mismatches. The presence of 4 (Yellow) reveals issue.

    Key Observations and Inferences by looking at the provided expected output:

* The top-left pixel in the output block is always the color of the input pixel.
* Input White (0) is *always* expanded to:
```
0 8
8 0
```
* Input Red (2) is *always* expanded to:
```
2 8
8 8
```
* Input Gray (5) is *always* expanded to:
```
5 8
8 8
```
* Input Yellow (4) is *always* expanded to
```
4 8
8 8
```
* From this, we see that all non-white expand to:
```
input 8
8     8
```
**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integer values (0-9) representing colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integer values (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: twice the height and width of the input_grid
  - name: 2x2_block
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      - parent: output_grid
      - origin: derived from input_grid cell position
      - top_left_cell: value matches corresponding input_grid cell
      - other_cells: value is azure (8) if the original cell is not white, has specific pattern if 0.

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Each input_grid cell maps to a 2x2 block in the output_grid.
  - name: assign_values
    description:  The top-left cell of the 2x2 block takes the original input cell's value.  If the original value is 0 (white), the 2x2 block becomes [0, 8; 8, 0]. Otherwise, the other three cells are 8 (azure).
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the grid size:** Create an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2.  **Map input to output:** For each cell in the input grid, create a corresponding 2x2 block of cells in the output grid.
3.  **Populate the 2x2 block:**
    *   The top-left cell of the 2x2 block in the output grid will have the same value as the original cell in the input grid.
    *   If the original cell value is 0 (white), the 2x2 block is filled as follows: `0` (top-left), `8` (top-right), `8` (bottom-left), `0` (bottom-right).
    *   If the original cell value is *not* 0, the 2x2 block is filled as follows: original value (top-left), `8` (top-right), `8` (bottom-left), `8` (bottom-right).

This revised program now correctly captures the consistent transformation logic observed across *all* three training examples. It clarifies the crucial difference in how white and non-white pixels are handled during the expansion.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
