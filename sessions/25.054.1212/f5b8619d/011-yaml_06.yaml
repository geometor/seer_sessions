facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 2 * input_grid.height
      - width: 2 * input_grid.width
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - action: transformation
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is mapped to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    details: >
      The original pixel's color appears to be replicated in a checkerboard
      pattern.
  - observation: checkerboard_pattern
    description: The output grid exhibits a pattern where each input pixel expands into a 2x2 block in output grid.
