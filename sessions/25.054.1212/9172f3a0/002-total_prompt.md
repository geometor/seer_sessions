## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 0
7 4 0
0 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0
7 7 7 4 4 4 0 0 0
7 7 7 4 4 4 0 0 0
7 7 7 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC4757D570>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input, where each original pixel is replicated to form a 3x3 block of the same color in the output. The '0' pixels in the input, representing white, remain '0' in the output, but they also form 3x3 blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - size: variable (e.g., 3x3)
      - colors: represent color according to COLOR_MAP

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - size: input_grid size * 3 (e.g., 9x9)
      - colors: represent color according to COLOR_MAP

actions:
  - name: replicate_pixel
    description: Each pixel in the input_grid is expanded into a 3x3 block of the same pixel value in the output_grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid elements map directly to output_grid elements, with each input pixel corresponding to a 3x3 block in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is 3 times the width and 3 times the height of the input grid.

2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:

    a. Determine the row and column of the current pixel.

    b. Calculate the corresponding top-left corner coordinates in the output grid by multiplying the input row and column by 3.

    c. **Replication:** Fill a 3x3 block in the output grid, starting from the calculated top-left corner, with the value of the current input pixel.

3. **Return Output Grid** Return output grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
