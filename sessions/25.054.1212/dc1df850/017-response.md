"""
1.  **Identify Initiators:** Find all red (2) and magenta (6) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Vertical Blue Line:** For each vertical pair of red and magenta, create a vertical line of blue (1) pixels.
3. **Line Boundaries**: This blue line starts on the row immediately below the red pixel and extends downwards, stopping on the row immediately above the magenta pixel. The line has the same x coordinate as the red and magenta.
4.  **No other Changes:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.
