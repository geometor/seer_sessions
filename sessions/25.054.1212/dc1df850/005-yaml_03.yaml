facts:
  - observation: |
      Red pixels (value 2) act as origins for a color transformation.
  - observation: |
      White pixels (value 0) adjacent to red pixels, specifically above and to the left of a red pixel, change their color.
  - observation: |
      The changed color is blue (value 1).
  - observation: |
      The color change propagates from a red pixel up and to the left until a non-white pixel is hit. The spreading should occur in all connected white cells.
  - observation: |
    The fill proceeds from any changed white pixel up and to the left.
  - observation: |
      Pixels of colors other than white (0) and red (2) are not affected by the transformation.  They retain their original color.
  - observation: |
      The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
