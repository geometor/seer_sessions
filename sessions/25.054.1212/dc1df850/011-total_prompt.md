Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **L-Shape Detection and Flood Fill:** Iterate through each red pixel.  For each red pixel:
    *   Check if it forms the corner of an "L" shape, where the other two points of the "L" are made up of white pixels. If so, apply the Flood Fill starting with the white pixel.
        *   An "L" shape can be any 3 adjacent pixels that consist of a corner and two lines of length one in each major axis direction
3.  **Flood Fill:** Change the white(0) pixels that are either directly or diagonally adjacent. Continue expanding until no more directly or diagonally adjacent pixels can be changed to blue (1).
4. **Preserve:** All non-white and non-red pixels keep their original values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
