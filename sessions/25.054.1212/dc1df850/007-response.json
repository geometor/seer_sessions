The input grid contains scattered pixels of red (2), green (3), and azure (8) on a white (0) background. The output grid seems to expand or \"flood fill\" some of the colored pixels, particularly the red (2) one, with blue (1) pixels. The green and azure pixels appear unchanged. There's also a new element in the upper right part with 1, the color blue.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
