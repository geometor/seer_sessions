"""
1.  **Identify** the red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Change the color of the red pixel at the top right to blue (1).
3.  Change to blue(1) all white pixels (0) to the left.
4. **Identify** the red (2) pixel in the input grid that is at the bottom-left
5.  **Flood Fill:** Starting from the bottom red (2) pixel, change all directly adjacent or diagonally adjacent white (0) pixels to blue (1). Continue this expansion until no more directly or diagonally adjacent white pixels can be changed to blue.
6.  **Preserve:** The green (3) and azure (8) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions and colors.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and resulting code were too focused on the specifics of the first example. It correctly identified some key actions (finding red pixels, changing colors, flood filling), but the logic for selecting *which* red pixel to use as a starting point for the flood fill, and the conditions for changing colors, were not generalizable. The code failed to correctly transform examples 2 and 3 because it assumed there would always be a single "top-right" red pixel and a single other red pixel, which is clearly false. The flood fill logic itself seems sound, but the trigger and initial conditions are wrong.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** We need to carefully analyze *all* provided examples, not just the first one, to identify the *true* underlying rule.  We need to move away from position-based rules ("top-right") and toward relationship-based or property-based rules.

2.  **Focus on Relationships:** The key is likely in the relationship between the red pixels and the areas that get flood-filled.  Instead of focusing on the "top-right", we need to see what's *common* about the red pixels that *do* trigger a flood fill across all examples. It appears it is filling where there are L shapes made of the same color, where color 2 is the corner.

3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:**  A new, more general natural language program needs to be developed based on the re-examined examples. This program should describe the conditions for flood filling in a way that applies to all cases.

4.  **Update the code:** the python script will need to change to reflect any
    updates to the natural language program, of course.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

I will use a table format (easier to read in markdown and can easily be converted to other formats) to present the information for each example, including both the original training input, expected, and script execution results, to get a complete picture of the problem:

| Example | Input Grid Shape | Output Grid Shape | Red Pixel Count (Input) | Red Pixel Positions (Input) | White Pixel Count (Input) | Notes on Discrepancies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The other red is not used as a seed for flood filling.                                                                                                                                                             |

Only one pixel changes color.                                                                                                                                            |

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **L-Shape Detection and Flood Fill:** Iterate through each red pixel. For each red pixel:

    *   Check if it forms the corner of an "L" shape, where the other two points of the "L" are made up of white pixels. If so, apply the Flood Fill starting with the white pixel.

        *   An "L" shape can be any 3 adjacent pixels that consist of a corner and two lines of length one in each major axis direction

3.  **Flood Fill:** Change the white(0) pixels that are either directly or diagonally adjacent. Continue expanding until no more directly or diagonally adjacent pixels can be changed to blue (1).

4. **Preserve:** All non-white and non-red pixels keep their original values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
