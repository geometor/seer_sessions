The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify Key Colors: Locate all pixels with the value 2 (red) in the top row.
2. Propagate Blue: For each red pixel identified in step 1, change all the white connected regions to its right and all white region below to blue (value 1). Stop when a colored block stops the spread.
3. Preserve other colors. The red and magenta pixels keep the original values.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was too simplistic. It correctly identified the starting red pixels in the top row but failed to correctly implement the flood fill. The flood fill logic in the provided code only updates the current cell and then attempts to recursively call itself to the right and down but does not account for regions already colored, ending the recursion almost immediately. It doesn't propagate the blue color as intended in the examples, leaving many white cells unchanged. The core issue lies within the `flood_fill_right_and_down` function.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Flood Fill:** Re-implement `flood_fill_right_and_down` to correctly propagate the blue color. The current implementation doesn't account for already filled pixels, stopping when adjacent to any non-white pixel. The fill should continue to adjacent white pixels to right or below.
2.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** Examine all examples carefully and identify where the initial understanding of red pixel propagation deviated from the observed behavior.
3.   **Connectivity Check:** Ensure propagation stops when hitting non-white values

**Metrics and Observations (Example-wise):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5, two red pixels on the top row, one magenta.
    *   Expected: Blue fills connected white pixels to the right and down from the red origins, stops at magenta.
    *   Observed Result: No Propagation
    *   Problems: Bad Flood Fill

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 8x8, one red pixel in the top row, and a red pixel on 7th row, green, and azure.
    *   Expected: Blue fill, stops at green.
    *   Observed Result: No Propagation
    *   Problems: Bad Flood Fill

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x4, one red on second row.
    *   Expected Output: Blue fill connects down and right
    *   Observed Result: No Propagation
    *   Problems: Bad Flood Fill

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: red_pixel
    properties:
      color: red
      location: top_row_or_below
    actions:
      - initiate_blue_propagation
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      color: white
      location: connected_to_red_pixel_right_or_down
    actions:
      - change_color_to_blue
  - object: non_white_pixel
    properties:
       color: not_white
    actions:
      - stop_blue_propagation

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Starting Points:** Locate all red pixels (value 2) in the grid.
2.  **Propagate Blue:** For each red pixel, change the color of connected white pixels (value 0) to its right and below it to blue (value 1). The change stops when a non-white pixel is encountered in either direction.
3.  **Preservation:** All other color pixels stay.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
