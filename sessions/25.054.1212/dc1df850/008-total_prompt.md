## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC4890A380>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC48908D00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains scattered pixels of red (2), green (3), and azure (8) on a white (0) background. The output grid seems to expand or "flood fill" some of the colored pixels, particularly the red (2) one, with blue (1) pixels. The green and azure pixels appear unchanged. There's also a new element in the upper right part with 1, the color blue.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 8x8
      colors: [white, red, green, azure, blue]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        red: 2
        green: 3
        azure: 8
        blue: 1
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: flood_fill
    agent: red_pixel
    target: adjacent_white_pixels
    result: change_color_to_blue
  - name: stay
    agent: green_pixel, azure_pixel
    target: self
    result: no change
  - name: add_blue
    agent: top_right_red
    target: adjacent cells left
    result: change_color_to_blue

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Change the color of the red pixel at the top right to blue (1).
3.  Change to blue(1) all white pixels (0) to the left.
4. **Identify** the red (2) pixel in the input grid that is at the bottom-left
5.  **Flood Fill:** Starting from the bottom red (2) pixel, change all directly adjacent or diagonally adjacent white (0) pixels to blue (1). Continue this expansion until no more directly or diagonally adjacent white pixels can be changed to blue.
6.  **Preserve:** The green (3) and azure (8) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions and colors.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
