## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x256 at 0x7BFC4890B040>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 0 0
1 2 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x256 at 0x7BFC48908D00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input grid is transformed into the output grid. The primary element to focus on seems to be the single red pixel (value '2') in the input. Its position and surrounding pixels seem to be key to the transformation. The output introduces blue pixels (value '1') in a specific pattern related to the red pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (4x5 in the example)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
    instances:
      - red_pixel:
          color: 2 (red)
          position: (1, 1) in input, (1,1) in output

actions:
  - name: surround_pixel
    description: Surrounds a target pixel with pixels of a specific color.
    parameters:
      - target_color: 2 (red)
      - surrounding_color: 1 (blue)
      - boundary: The operation does not extend beyond the boundaries of the initial image, top and left only.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Defines which pixels are considered neighbors. In this case, the surrounding cells on the top and left sides as well as the immediate diagonals.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target:** Locate the pixel with a value of '2' (red) within the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Surrounding - top and left only:**
    *   Change to '1' (blue) the red pixel's immediate top, left and diagonal neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, but not down) if those neighbors are '0' (white).
    *   If cells identified at step 2 are not on the image, ignore them.
3. Leave the original '2' pixel unchanged
4. All the remaining '0' are left unchanged.

In essence, the transformation identifies a specific colored pixel (red, '2') and, if the conditions are met, changes the color of the surrounding top, left, top-left, top-right, and bottom-left neighbor pixels to blue ('1'). The original red pixel remains red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
