The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a distinct color. The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement of the elements within the grid, not a change in the elements themselves. The positions of the numbers change, suggesting a spatial or geometric transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
