Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a reflection across the vertical axis. For each row in the input grid, the order of the pixels is reversed to create the corresponding row in the output grid. This is equivalent to flipping the grid horizontally. The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged, and only the positions of the pixels within each row are altered.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Reflects the input grid across the vertical axis.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Flip the array horizontally (left-right).
    output_array = np.fliplr(input_array)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
