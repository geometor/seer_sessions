## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47FB9660>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47FB83D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid's contents.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - color: determined by integer value
      - position: row and column index

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - element_positions: change after rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.  This means each element in the input grid is moved to a new position in the output grid corresponding to the rotation. For example, the top-left element of the input grid becomes the bottom-left element of the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
