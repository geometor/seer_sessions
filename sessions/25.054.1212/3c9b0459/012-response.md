The transformation rule is a 180-degree rotation of the entire input grid. This means that the top-left element becomes the bottom-right, the top-right becomes the bottom-left, and so on. The grid is effectively flipped both horizontally and vertically. The elements maintain their original color values; only their positions within the grid change.
