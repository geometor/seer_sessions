"""
The transformation rule is a reflection across the vertical axis. For each row in the input grid, the order of the pixels is reversed to create the corresponding row in the output grid. This is equivalent to flipping the grid horizontally. The overall dimensions of the grid remain unchanged, and only the positions of the pixels within each row are altered.
