Both grids have the same dimensions (6 rows and 2 columns in this example). The grids contain single-digit integers, each representing a distinct color. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colored pixels with other colors based on their initial value. Specifically, the white (0) pixels are being replaced. The top two rows keep the same color, the next two rows change the value to the color of the first cell (8, azure), and the next two rows the color of the second cell (3, green).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
