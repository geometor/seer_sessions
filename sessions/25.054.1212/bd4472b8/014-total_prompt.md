## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 3
5 5
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x384 at 0x7BFC443E3D90>

**output:**
```
8 3
5 5
8 8
3 3
8 8
3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x384 at 0x7BFC47F93880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions (6 rows and 2 columns in this example). The grids contain single-digit integers, each representing a distinct color. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colored pixels with other colors based on their initial value. Specifically, the white (0) pixels are being replaced. The top two rows keep the same color, the next two rows change the value to the color of the first cell (8, azure), and the next two rows the color of the second cell (3, green).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      rows: 6
      columns: 2
      cells: [8, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      rows: 6
      columns: 2
      cells: [8, 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3]

  - type: pixel
    description: individual cell in the grid
    properties:
       value: integer (0-9)
       color:  # Derived from value based on COLOR_MAP
         0: white
         1: blue
         2: red
         3: green
         4: yellow
         5: gray
         6: magenta
         7: orange
         8: azure
         9: maroon
       position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    description: Replaces pixel values based on their original value and their position
    parameters:
      original_value: [0]
      replacement_logic: 
        rows_1_2:  no change
        rows_3_4: value in cell(0,0)
        rows_5_6: value in cell(0,1)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: output grid is derived from the input grid by replacing the values of all '0' (white) with a certain rule
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Obtain the input grid, which is a 2D array of integers.
2.  **Preserve top:** The first two rows of the input will maintain it's value to the output.
3. **Iterate:** Iterate through each of the next two rows, from row index 2 and row index 3.
4.  **Replacement:** For each pixel within the current row, if the pixel's value is 0 (white): check the position.
5. **Next Two Rows**: Iterate over row index 4 and 5.
6. Replace zero with the value of the first cell (0,0).
7. **Next Two Rows**: Iterate over row index 6 and 7.
8. Replace zero with the value of the second cell (0,1).
9.  **Output:** Return the modified grid as the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
