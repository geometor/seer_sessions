## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 4
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x512 at 0x7BFC4890A380>

**output:**
```
2 1 4
5 5 5
2 2 2
1 1 1
4 4 4
2 2 2
1 1 1
4 4 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same integers. The input grid appears to have a smaller section of non-zero values at the top, while the rest is filled with zeros. The output grid expands a pattern based on the top rows of the input. The spatial relationship and ordering of colors are crucial.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid of integers, representing colors.
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 8
      - top_section:  Non-zero values in the top rows.
      - bottom_section: All zeros.
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid of integers, representing colors.
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 8
      - pattern:  Replication of the top section of the input.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid replicates the top section of the input grid. Specifically it copies each color row
    properties:
      - replication_factor_row_1 : input[0,0], output[2,:],output[5,:]
      - replication_factor_row_2 : input[0,1], output[3,:],output[6,:]
      - replication_factor_row_3 : input[0,2], output[4,:],output[7,:]
      - replication_factor_row_4 : input[1,:], output[1,:]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "pattern region":** In the input grid, locate the contiguous block of rows at the top containing non-zero values. In this case rows one and two, colors [2,1,4] and [5,5,5] respectively.
2.  **Replicate Each color:**
    *   Copy the first color in the first row (2/red). Create two more rows of all red.
    *   Copy the second color in the first row (1/blue). Create two more rows of all blue.
    *   Copy the third color in the first row (4/yellow). Create two more rows of all yellow.
    *   Copy the entire second row ([5,5,5] grey). Create no additional rows.
3. **Assemble Output** The output is the rows of the identified "pattern region", follow by the replicated rows of each color.

Essentially, the transformation takes the first row of the input and replicates each of *those* colors twice below the original pattern region. The second input row is copied without change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
