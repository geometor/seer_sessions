## Example 6

**input:**
```
0 2 0 2 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 0 2
2 2 2 0 0
0 0 2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4423F820>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 5 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4423D180>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains only two colors: white (0) and red (2). The output grid contains white (0) and gray (5). The output seems to somehow summarize or abstract the input. The red pixels in the input appear to be replaced by gray in the output. The relationship doesn't look like a simple 1-to-1 pixel mapping because the sizes are different. It's more like a block-based transformation. The size reduction suggests some form of compression or summarization.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: [0, 2]  # white, red

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 5]  # white, gray

actions:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: "A process that converts the input grid to the output grid."

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: "The output grid is smaller than the input grid, suggesting a summarization or compression."
    - type: color_mapping
      from: input_grid
      to:   output_grid
      description:  "Red (2) in the input maps to gray (5) in the output; White (0) remains White (0)"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input 5x5 grid into 3x3 overlapping regions. Consider a sliding 3x3 window that creates nine overlapping 3 x 3 regions. These overlap starting with top-left as the first, with movements going right and down.

2. **Check Region and Reduce:** The first region is top-left corner.
    - If the region contains any red pixels (value 2), the central pixel of the output grid corresponding to this region should be gray (5).
    - If a 3x3 region contains no red, the corresponding output will be white(0).
    - The 3x3 output is effectively made of nine center values.

3.  **Output:** The output is a 3x3 grid, which is formed by taking the results above.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
