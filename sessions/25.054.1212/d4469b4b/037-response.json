The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid contains white (0) and gray (5). The output appears to be a condensed and recolored representation of a pattern within the input. It seems like contiguous blocks of green (3) in input becomes gray (5) in the output and the output's dimension are related to how many green (3) contiguous blocks there.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There are three such rows and 3 such columns in input, therefore create an output of 3x3.\n3.  **Recolor:** Iterate through the green object, whereever there are 3s change them to 5 in the output. Where there are 0s, keep them 0 in the output.\n\nIn essence, the program identifies the contiguous blocks of green in the input, creates a smaller grid representing the \"shape\" of the object formed by those contiguous green, and recolors the green blocks to gray, maintaining white pixels as white.\n"
