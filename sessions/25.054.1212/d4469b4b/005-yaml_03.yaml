input_grid_size: 5x5

color_palette: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5] # white, blue, red, green, gray
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0) # most common, considered background
      - color: non-white (1, 2, 3) # trigger change to gray, based on region
      - color: gray (5)  # produced in output
  - type: region
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - overlap: True
      - count: 9 # total regions considered

            The output is calculated by examining 9 overlapping
            3x3 regions of the input grid. If ANY of the pixels
            in a region are non-white (color other than 0), the
            corresponding output pixel transitions from white (0)
            to gray (5) under specific conditions.  If all pixels
            within a region are white (color 0), then the
            corresponding output pixel remains white (0).  The
            specific locations where the output transitions is
            not consistent with the rule as stated.  If all pixels
            are white, the output pixel is white.
    inputs:
      - 3x3 region
    outputs:
      - single pixel value
