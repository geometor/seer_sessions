The input grid contains green (3) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size and a change in color for some of the pixels. It appears there is a relationship between the positions and colors of the input to how the output is constructed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
