facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is always 5x5. The output grid is always 3x3.
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - action: subgrid_extraction
    description: |
      A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the center of the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: subgrid
  - action: color_mapping
    description: |
       The central element in the input array becomes the central element
       of the output. The first and last rows/cols become 5 in the second row/col
       of the ouput respectively, if they are not zero.

  - action: transformation
    description: |
      The transformation combines subgrid extraction and color mapping to produce the output.
