## Example 5

**input:**
```
2 0 2 0 2
2 0 0 0 2
2 2 0 0 0
2 0 0 2 2
2 2 2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4423F820>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 5 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4423D9C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (5x5) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains only two colors: red (2) and white (0). The output grid also contains only two colors: grey (5) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size and a change in color of some pixels. There is some sort of summarization/compression to reduce the grid size. The relative positions of the 0's are very similar.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    colors: [red, white]
    values: [2, 0]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [grey, white]
    values: [5, 0]

actions:
  - name: reduce_size
    description: The grid dimensions are reduced from 5x5 to 3x3.
  - name: change_color
    description:  Red pixels (2) in the input are converted to grey pixels (5) in the output, white pixels (0) remain the same.
  - name: summarize
    description: The output grid summarizes 3x3 regions in input grid.

relationships:
    - input_grid is transformed into output_grid
    - output_pixels are a summary of input_pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 5x5 input grid and prepare an empty 3x3 output grid.

2.  **Iteration through output grid:** For each cell in the 3x3 output grid, do the following.

3. **Mapping and Summarization** The x,y coordinates of output cells map onto the input as follows:
   - Output (0,0) represents Input region within x=0-2, y=0-2. If Input region contains at least one red (2) pixel, set Output to grey (5).
   - Output (0,1) represents Input region within x=0-2, y=1-3
   - Output (0,2) represents Input region within x=0-2, y=2-4
   - Output (1,0) represents Input region within x=1-3, y=0-2
   - Output (1,1) represents Input region within x=1-3, y=1-3
   - Output (1,2) represents Input region within x=1-3, y=2-4
   - Output (2,0) represents Input region within x=2-4, y=0-2
   - Output (2,1) represents Input region within x=2-4, y=1-3
   - Output (2,2) represents Input region within x=2-4, y=2-4
   - Specifically the central 3x3 area of the input becomes the output.

4. **Color Transformation**: if the input pixels within that region contains any 2 (red pixels) then the output cell is a 5, otherwise it is a 0.

In essence any red (2) in 3x3 regions in the center of input will be gray(5) in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
