"""
The input 5x5 grid is transformed into a 3x3 output grid. The transformation involves checking overlapping 3x3 regions of the input grid. For each 3x3 region centered at (i, j) of the input grid, if any pixel in the region is non-white (not 0), the corresponding pixel (i, j) in the output grid is set to gray (5). Otherwise, it remains white (0).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the examples, and an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 3x3 sliding window, which is a good starting point. However, it consistently overestimates the presence of grey (5) pixels.  The core issue is that it sets the output to gray (5) if *any* non-white pixel is found within the 3x3 window. The expected outputs show a more nuanced pattern. It's not sufficient to simply detect the *presence* of a non-white pixel. The *position* and the values in relation to the central pixel matters. The results consistently show gray pixels corresponding to input non-white pixel locations, with the exception that if a non-white pixel occurs in a corner position of a window, the grey is not created in that window position.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the Condition:** Instead of a simple `np.any(region != 0)`, we need to evaluate the values of pixels relative to the center of the 3x3 window.
2.  **Consider all examples:** Take all of the examples into account when formulating a new natural language program.

**Example Analysis & Metrics:**

Here's a summary consolidated for all examples.

| Example | Input Size | Output Size |  Pixels Off | Notes                                                                          |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray.                                                                  |
| 2       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray.                                                       |
| 3       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray.                                                       |
| 4       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray. |
| 5       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray.                                                       |
| 6       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray.                                                       |
| 7       | 5x5        | 3x3         | 4            | Over-predicts gray.                                                       |

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: 034
input_grid_size: 5x5
output_grid_size: 3x3
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      value: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
      position: (row, column)
  - type: window
    properties:
       size: 3x3
       center: (row, column)
actions:
  - name: check_window
    description: Examine a 3x3 window of pixels in the input grid.
  - name: set_output_pixel
    description: Set the value of a pixel in the output grid based on input window.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 5x5 grid of pixels.
2.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, initially all white (0).
3.  **Process:** Iterate through each possible 3x3 window within the input grid. The center of each 3x3 window corresponds to a pixel location in the output grid.
4.  **Rule:** For each 3x3 window:
    *   If the *center* pixel of the 3x3 input window is not white (0), set the corresponding output pixel to gray (5).
    *   Otherwise, leave the corresponding output pixel as white (0).

In simpler terms, the output grid is a 3x3 representation of the input grid.  A pixel in the output grid is gray (5) if and only if the corresponding center pixel in the 5x5 input grid (when considering a 3x3 window around it) is *not* white (0). Otherwise the output pixel is white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
