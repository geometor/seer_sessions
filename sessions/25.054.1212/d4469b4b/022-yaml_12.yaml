task: "ARC-AGI Pattern Extraction"
examples:
  - input_shape: [5, 5]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    input_colors: [0, 2]
    output_color: 5 # Dominant color
    transformation: "extract_non_zero_border_and_create_border"

        type: grid
        properties:
          - size: 5x5
          - colors: [0, x]  # x is a non-zero color

    actions:
      - name: create_output
        description:  "A 3x3 output grid is created. If an input pixel and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors are all 0, then the corresponding center output pixel is 0. Otherwise, the center output pixel and its immediate vertical and horizontal output pixels are 5."
