observations:
  - task_id: '00'  # Placeholder, replace with actual task ID if available
    grid_size:
      input: 5x5
      output: 3x3
    color_usage:
      input: "Contains colors 0-3, varies per example."
      output: "Always contains 0 and 5."
    output_pattern: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
      The output always contains gray (5) pixels.
      The center pixel of the output may be the same as the input, if present, or zero.
      Gray pixels appear to be related to the presence of non-zero values in the rows/columns.
    transformations:
      - type: "Conditional Gray Placement"
        description: |
             If a row or column in the input grid contains at least one non-zero
             pixel, then the corresponding row/column position will have one or
             more gray pixels
        conditions:
          row_check: "Non-zero pixel exists in input row."
          column_check: "Non-zero pixel exists in input column."
