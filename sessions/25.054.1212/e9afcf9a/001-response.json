The input grid consists of two horizontal rows: the top row is entirely green (color code 3), and the bottom row is entirely maroon (color code 9). The output grid retains the same dimensions but alters the arrangement of colors.  The transformation appears to involve an alternating pattern of colors within each row and between rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This creates an inversion of colors of the previous rows, maintaining the horizontal alternation.\n\nIn simpler, direct steps: Create an alternating pattern of green and maroon. The first cell is green. Adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical) can not have same color.\n"
