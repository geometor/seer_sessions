facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: |
     Pixels, characterized by color (integer value) and position (row, column).
  - colors:
      - 0: white
      - 2: red
      - 4: yellow
  - property: |
      Adjacency of pixels is crucial for the transformation.
  - transformation_context: |
      Yellow pixels appear in the output based on a combination of red and
      white pixels in the input.
  - spatial_relation: |
      Horizontal and vertical adjacency matter, diagonals do not appear to
      be relevant.
  - initial_hypothesis: |
      Yellow pixels are placed where red and white pixels are orthogonally adjacent.
