## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x192 at 0x7BFC4890B040>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0
4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, aiming to capture the essence of the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve some kind of interaction or influence between the red pixels and potentially the introduction of yellow pixels. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid. There seems to be a concept of "filling" or "expansion" around certain red pixels, possibly influenced by adjacent pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - red (2)
        - white (0)
        - yellow (4)
      position: [row, column]  # Represented by grid coordinates
    relationships:
      - adjacent: [pixel1, pixel2] # Indicates neighboring pixels

actions:
  - type: fill
    properties:
      source_color: red (2) # The color initiating the fill
      target_color: yellow (4)
      direction: horizontal/vertical # filling expands sideway and vertically
      constraints:
          - white (0) # white pixels are turning to yellow

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.

2. **Horizontal and Vertical Expansion:**
    *   For any continuous horizontal sequence of red pixels, turn all white pixels between the left-most pixel and right-most pixel in the sequence to yellow.
    *   For any continuous vertical sequence of red pixels, turn all white pixels between the up-most and down-most pixel in the sequence to yellow.

3. **Diagonal connections:**
    * For any diagonal sequence (upleft, downright) or (upright, downleft), where at least 3 continuous pixels in the sequence, turn the white pixels between upmost and downmost pixels to yellow.

4. **Result:** The output grid is the result of applying these filling rules.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
