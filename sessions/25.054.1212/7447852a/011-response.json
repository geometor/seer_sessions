If a black pixel is adjacent to *any* red pixel, change it to a yellow (4) pixel in the output grid. If a black pixel has red pixels both horizontally adjacent AND vertically adjacent, it still changes only to ONE yellow pixel in the corresponding output grid.\n4.  **Black Pixel Update:** Any black pixel that is *not* adjacent to a red pixel remains black in the output grid.\n\nThe transformation can be described as \"spreading\" yellow from the red pixels to any directly adjacent black pixels, replacing those black pixels with yellow ones.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets the valid neighbors of a cell (up, down, left, right).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    if row > 0:\n        neighbors.append((row - 1, col))  # Up\n    if row < rows - 1:\n        neighbors.append((row + 1, col))  # Down\n    if col > 0:\n        neighbors.append((row, col - 1))  # Left\n    if col < cols - 1:\n        neighbors.append((row, col + 1))  # Right\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Start with a copy to preserve red pixels\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[row, col] == 0:  # Check if it's a black pixel\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col)\n                for r, c in neighbors:\n                    if input_grid[r, c] == 2:  # Check for adjacent red pixel\n                        output_grid[row, col] = 4  # Change to yellow\n                        break  # Only change once, even if multiple red neighbors\n            # Implicitly, if it's a red pixel (2), it remains unchanged\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
