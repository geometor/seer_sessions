The input grid consists primarily of white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels while retaining some of the red and white pixels from the input. The dimensions of the grid (height and width) remain constant during the transformation. The key seems to be the relative positioning and arrangement of the red pixels, with yellow pixels appearing in their vicinity in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The red pixels in the input grid, that are not any of the corners in these potential 3x3 squares, become yellow.\n  - relationship: |\n      Input and output grids have an identical structure/schema.\n\n```"
