## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7BFC48909EA0>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x384 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids is their dimensions, with the input grid is 3x4, and the output is 6x4. The output grid appears to be a patterned repetition of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x4
    elements: [9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9]
    colors: [maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, gray, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, maroon]
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 6x4
    elements: [9, 5, 9, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9]
    colors: [maroon, gray, maroon, maroon, gray, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, gray, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, maroon ]
  - type: transformation
    description: The input grid is duplicated and placed below the original to form first part of output, then the input grid is transposed, and added on the right hand side of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Duplicate:** The original 3x4 input grid is duplicated.
2. **Stack:** the duplicated copy is added to bottom of original grid.
3. **Transpose Input:** Create a transposed version of original grid.
4. **Append Transposed Copy:** Attach it to the right side of original grid.

In simple terms the output grid is constructed by making a copy of the input and adding it to the bottom. Then, the input grid is transposed and added to the right of the original.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
