            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a misunderstanding of the transformation rule. It correctly identifies non-zero elements and attempts to expand them, but the logic for *how* they expand is incorrect. The code seems to be creating squares down and to the right based on leftward position, rather than creating squares based on a \"growth\" factor that equals the number of non-zero elements. The zeros are handled correctly (they are simply copied).  The core issue is the square expansion logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Observations:** Carefully re-examine *all* training examples to pinpoint the *exact* relationship between the input non-zero values and the output square sizes. The key is understanding that the height of output is determined by the *number of non-zero values in the input*, and the increasing width of the \"square\" is the count from 1 up to this number.\n\n2.  **Correct the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe this refined understanding.\n\n3.  **Metrics and Error Analysis:** Use the color and size information from each example and compare to the Expected.\n\n**Metrics and Error Analysis (Code Execution):**\n\nI will not use code execution in the Dreamer phase. I am reviewing the results of a previous code execution and making notes here.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `1 1 0 0 0 0`. Expected Output height: 3, width, 6. Transformed Output height: 2, width: 6.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. Expected Output height: 4, width: 8. Transformed output height: 1, width: 8.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. Expected Output height: 5, width: 10. Transformed Output height: 3, width: 10.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `8 8 8 8 0 0`. Expected output height: 3, width: 6. Transformed Output height: 4, width: 6.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `7 0 0 0 0 0`. Expected Output height: 3, width: 6. Transformed output height: 1, width: 6.\n\nThe transformed output's height is consistently wrong, confirming the issue with the square expansion logic.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 014\nobjects:\n  - id: input_row\n    type: grid\n    description: A 1xN grid representing the initial state.\n    properties:\n      - cells: Contains values from 0-9, representing colors.\n      - non_zero_cells: Cells with values other than 0. These are the 'source' of the expansion.\n      - zero_cells: Cells with value 0.  These are copied directly to the output.\n\n  - id: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    description: An MxN grid representing the transformed state.\n    properties:\n      - height:  Determined by the total number of non-zero values in the input row.\n      - width: The same as the input row.\n      - expanded_squares: Regions of non-zero color originating from the non-zero cells in the input row.  These are not always perfect squares.\n      - zero_regions: Regions of color 0, directly copied from the corresponding position in the input row.\n\nactions:\n  - name: expand\n    description: Non-zero values in the input row are expanded into \"squares\" in the output grid.  The height is determined by the number of non-zero elements.\n    agent: non_zero_cells\n    parameters:\n      - height: number of non zero colors in the input row\n      - start_width: 1, end_width: height\n      - color:  The value of the non-zero cell in the input row.\n\n  - name: copy\n    description: Zero values in the input row are copied to all corresponding columns in the output grid.\n    agent: zero_cells\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is a single row of numbers (a 1xN grid).\n2.  **Count Non-Zeros:** Count the number of non-zero values in the input row. This count determines the height (M) of the output grid.\n3.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid will be MxN, where N is the width of the input grid.\n4.  **Zero Handling:** For every zero in the input row, copy that zero to *all* rows of the corresponding column in the output grid.\n5.  **Non-Zero Expansion:** For each non-zero value in the input row:\n    *   The value determines the color of the expanded \"square\".\n    *   The \"square\" is more like a growing triangle. It will start with one cell and each row will grow by one cell.\n    *   The number of rows of the \"square\" will correspond to the number of non-zero values.\n    *   Start to fill on the row that corresponds to the count of previous non-zero value.\n6. The non-zero values \"expand\" into N rows, but are added to the column, starting at 1.\n\nExample:\nInput: 1 1 0 0\n- 2 non-zero values, output height will be 2.\n- first '1':\n row 1: 1\n row 2: 1\n- second '1':\n  row 1: 1\n  row 2: 1 1\n- '0' values are just copied\nResult:\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n2 0 0\n- 1 non-zero value, output height is 1\n2 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n1 1 1 0\n- 3 non-zero values, output height will be 3.\n- first '1':\n row 1: 1\n row 2: 1\n row 3: 1\n- second '1':\n  row 1: 1\n  row 2: 1 1\n  row 3: 1 1\n- third '1':\n row 1: 1\n row 2: 1 1\n row 3: 1 1 1\n- '0' is copied.\nResult:\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n"
