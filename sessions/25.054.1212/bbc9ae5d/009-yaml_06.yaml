facts:
  - object: input_row
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 1 x N (where N is variable)
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - identified: The most frequent non-zero color is identified.
      - counted: The occurrences of the most frequent non-zero color are counted.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: equal to number of occurrences of identified non-zero color in input row + (number of occurences of identified non-zero color in the input row - 1)
      - columns: same as the input row
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - filled: Each row is filled sequentially. The number of color filled columns increases by 1 in each row.
      - replicated:  First non-zero color is replicated, and shifted by one to the right for next row.
