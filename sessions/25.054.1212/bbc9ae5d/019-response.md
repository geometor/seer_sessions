Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of integers. The input is a single row (1x6 grid), and the output is a rectangular grid (3x6 grid). The values '8' (azure) and '0' (white) are present in both input and output. The number of '8's increases, and the number of '0's decreases. The transformation appears to be an expansion or replication of the input row, but with a change in some of the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x6
    elements: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
  - observation: row_replication
    description: The input row seems to be replicated multiple times to form the output grid.
  - observation: element_change
    description: Some '8' elements are constant in output grid, whereas some of the '0' are not present
  - observation: output_height
    description: The number of rows in the output grid is 3.
  - observation: output_width
    description: the number of columns in the output is the same as the input
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate:** Replicate the input row three times to create an initial 3x6 grid.
2.  **Maintain last two columns**: Starting from last two columns, remove all the values except the values in the first row.
