            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept of expanding the non-zero pixels based on their value. However, it makes a crucial error in how it handles the expansion, specifically in calculating the indices of the new pixels. It's only expanding vertically by replicating the entire row and not creating the square/rectangle shaped regions defined by `value + 1`. The horizontal expansion is also incorrect, not repeating the color enough times.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors involves:\n1.  **Correcting Index Calculation:** Instead of shifting the whole row, each cell needs to individually generate a block of size (value + 1) x (value+1).\n2.  **Fixing height/width:** Correcting error in dimension calculation\n3.\t**Re-evaluating Zero Handling:** Zeroes should maintain position *within* the expanded grid, but they should not prevent the expansion of other non-zero values.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary based on a closer look:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape (Expected) | Output Shape (Actual) | Correct Pixels | Incorrect Pixels | Notes                                                                          |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | (1, 6)      | (3, 6)                 | (2, 6)                | Some          | Many             | Vertical expansion is short, horizontal expansion is incorrect.                    |\n| 2       | (1, 8)      | (4, 8)               | (3, 8)                | Some           | Many               | Vertical expansion is short, horizontal expansion is incorrect. |\n| 3       | (1, 10)     | (6, 10)                 | (6, 10)              | Some           | Many            |Vertical expansion is correct in this case (input height * 6), horizontal is wrong   |\n| 4       | (1, 6)     | (3, 6)       |  Error      | N/A                 | N/A      | Out of bounds error, vertical expansion is incorrect for input value * 9            |\n| 5       | (1, 6)      |  (3, 6)    |  Error         | N/A               | N/A     |   Out of bounds error, vertical expansion is incorrect for input value * 8            |\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 028\nobjects:\n  - description: Input grid pixels\n    properties:\n      value: Integer (0-9) representing color\n      position: (row, column) coordinates\n      is_agent: False\n  - description: expanded blocks\n    properties:\n        color: integer representing color of the input pixel\n        size: dependent on input pixel value (value + 1)\n\nactions:\n  - name: ExpandPixel\n    agent: program\n    input: Single pixel\n    description: >\n      If the pixel value is non-zero, create a square block.\n      The side should be of the length of input pixel's value + 1.\n      The block's color matches the input pixel's color.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **For each pixel:**\n    *   Get the pixel's value (`V`).\n    *   If `V` is not zero:\n        *   Create a square block of pixels with dimensions (`V` + 1) x (`V` + 1).\n        *   Fill this block with the color represented by `V`.\n        *   Place this block in the output grid, starting at a row index,\n            where the top left block starts on the original row.\n            The row blocks begin on multiples of `input_height`.\n        *   Place the additional blocks in successive columns.\n        * That is, if `input[row,col]` is the original pixel location, put the top left corner of the blocks beginning at `output[row + i * input_height, col + j]` for i and j from 0 to V\n    *   If `V` is zero:\n        *   Copy the zero value to its original position.\n\t\t*\tCopy the zeros to vertically stacked output grids.\n```\n"
