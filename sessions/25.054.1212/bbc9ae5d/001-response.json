The input is a single horizontal line, and the output is a rectangle. The colors involved are blue (1) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve expanding the blue region downwards and to the right.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Stop once there are three rows.\n3. **Maintain White regions** The white regions are maintained.\n4.  **Output Grid:** Assemble the expanded blue region and the white region to form the output grid.\n\nIn simpler terms, the blue region grows into a rectangle by expanding downwards.
