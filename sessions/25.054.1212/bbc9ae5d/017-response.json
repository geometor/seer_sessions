            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding, focusing on expanding non-zero values into squares. The results from running the code on all training examples reveal a critical flaw: the expansion logic is incorrect, and the height calculation is not always right. The number of rows in the output should correspond to the number of non-zero values before that given value. Zeros are simply copied.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Height Calculation:** The output grid's height isn't simply the *total* number of non-zero values. Instead, for each non-zero element at index `j`, the number of rows added to the output due to that element corresponds to the number of non-zero elements from index 0 up to *and including* `j`. This will determine correct final size.\n2.  **Correct Expansion Logic:** It's not a square that's being formed. Instead, each non-zero value expands horizontally to the right, in each *successive* row, by one more pixel than the previous row. The expansion length is also limited by the width of the input.\n3. Zero Value handeling: It seems like zeros are simply copied without changes.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_width: 6\n    input_height: 1\n    output_width: 6\n    output_height: 3\n    non_zero_count: 2\n    zero_count: 4\n    transform_description: >\n        Two blue (1) pixels expand.\n        Four white (0) pixels are copied.\n        Expected height is miscalculated.\n    correct: False\n\n  - id: 2\n    input_width: 8\n    input_height: 1\n    output_width: 8\n    output_height: 4\n    non_zero_count: 1\n    zero_count: 7\n    transform_description: >\n        One red (2) pixel expands.\n        Seven white (0) pixels are copied.\n        Expected height is miscalculated.\n    correct: False\n\n  - id: 3\n    input_width: 10\n    input_height: 1\n    output_width: 10\n    output_height: 5\n    non_zero_count: 3\n    zero_count: 7\n    transform_description: >\n      Three grey(5) expand.\n      Seven white (0) are copied.\n    correct: False\n\n  - id: 4\n    input_width: 6\n    input_height: 1\n    output_width: 6\n    output_height: 3\n    non_zero_count: 4\n    zero_count: 2\n    transform_description: >\n      4 azure(8) expand.\n      2 white(0) are copied\n    correct: False\n\n  - id: 5\n    input_width: 6\n    input_height: 1\n    output_width: 6\n    output_height: 3\n    non_zero_count: 1\n    zero_count: 5\n    transform_description: >\n      One orange(7) pixel expands\n      Five white(0) pixel are copied\n    correct: False\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** A single row of pixels (1xN grid).\n2.  **Output:** A grid of pixels (MxN grid)\n3.  **Process:**\n    *   Iterate through each pixel in the input row.\n    *   If the pixel is a zero (white), copy it to the corresponding column in *all* rows of the output grid.\n    *   If the pixel is non-zero:\n        *   Determine the number of non-zero pixels encountered in the input row up to and including the current pixel. Let this number be `r`.\n        *   The non-zero pixel will affect `r` number of rows.\n        *    For each of the `r` rows:\n             *   the first row affected contains one pixel of current input color\n             *   the second row has two pixels\n             *   ... and so on. The final row will extend to the right by `r`\n                pixels, or be truncated at the input width.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Example 1):**\n\nInput: `1 1 0 0 0 0`\n\n1.  First '1':  `r` = 1. Output Row 1: `1`\n2.  Second '1': `r` = 2. Output Row 1&2: `1 1` , `1 1`\n3.  First '0': Copy to all rows. All zero columns are copied, so no need to\n    special handle.\n4.  Remaining '0's: Same as above.\n\nFinal Output will be:\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n"
