            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"Replicate the input row three times. Then, in the new grid, keep only the first row of two '0' (white) values from the input, eliminating the rest below them.\") was too simplistic and focused on the constant values in example 1. It fails to capture the core logic, which, upon examining all examples, is related to extending a sequence of non-zero colors until the last non zero and replicating zeros on end. The current code only replicates the input row without considering the progressive extension of the non-zero color sequence, and only keeps the original zeros at end.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will meticulously examine each input/output pair, noting the precise changes in color sequences and lengths.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Reframe thinking to identify the \"object\" not just as the entire row, but as *sequences* of non-zero colors within the row.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will develop a new program that focuses on identifying these non-zero color sequences, extending them progressively, and replicating the trailing zeros.\n4.    **Metrics:**\n    *   Report the length of the input.\n    *   Report the index of the first zero.\n    *   Report the number of rows in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"The input is a single row of pixels.\"\n    type: \"input_structure\"\n  - description: \"The output consists of multiple rows, increasing in length.\"\n    type: \"output_structure\"\n  - description: \"Each output row extends the sequence of non-zero colors from the input.\"\n    type: \"transformation_rule\"\n    details: \"The non-zero color sequence in each subsequent row is one pixel longer than the previous row, up until the last non zero pixel.\"\n  - description: \"Trailing zeros from the input are preserved in each output row.\"\n    type: \"transformation_rule\"\n    details: \"The zeros at the end of the input row maintain original length in the output.\"\n  - description: \"object of interest is non zero sequence and trailing zeros.\"\n    type: \"objects\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** the sequence of non-zero color pixels in the input row, and the sequence of trailing zero pixels.\n2.  **Determine** the length of the non-zero sequence and the index of the first zero in this sequence.\n3.  **Create** output rows. The number of output rows is equal to the count of non-zero colors in the input.\n4.  **Extend** For each output row:\n    *   Copy the initial non-zero color sequence from the input.\n    *   Extend the sequence by one pixel for each subsequent row, repeating the last color of the sequence.\n    *   Append the original trailing zeros from the input to maintain their original length.\n\nMetrics:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 1 1 0 0 0 0\nInput length: 6\nfirst zero: 2\noutput rows: 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nInput length: 8\nfirst zero: 1\noutput rows: 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nInput length: 10\nfirst zero: 3\noutput rows: 3\n\nExample 4:\nInput: 8 8 8 8 0 0\nInput length: 6\nfirst zero: 4\noutput rows: 4\n\nExample 5:\nInput: 7 0 0 0 0 0\nInput length: 6\nfirst zero: 1\noutput rows: 1\n"
