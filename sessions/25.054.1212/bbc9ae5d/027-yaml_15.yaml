        action: "expand into two horizontal pixels"
        height_multiplier: 3
        width_expansion: [1, 1]

  - input_shape: [1, 8]
    output_shape: [4, 8]
    transformations:
      - object: input pixel with value 2
        action: "expand into three horizontal pixels"

        height_multiplier: 6
        width_expansion: [5,5,5,5,5,5]
  - input_shape: [1, 6]
    output_shape: [9, 6]
    transformations:
      - object: input pixel with value 8
        action: expand into nine horizontal pixels
        height_multiplier: 9
        width_expansion: [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

  - input_shape: [1, 6]
    output_shape: [8, 6]
    transformations:
      - object: input pixel with value 7
        action: expand into eight horizontal pixels.
        height_multiplier: 8
        width_expansion: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]

general_rule:
  - For each non-zero pixel in the input grid:
    - Determine its value (V).
    - The output grid's height will be (V+1) times the original height.
    - Replicate the non-zero pixel horizontally (V+1) times, at each corresponding vertical level.
    - Preserve 0 value pixels.
