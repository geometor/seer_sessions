  - id: example_1
    input_grid: "1 1 0 0 0 0"
    output_grid: "1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0"
    transformed_output: "1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0"
    match: False
    observations:
      - The input has two '1's (blue).
      - The expected output has 3 rows, corresponding to the counts of '1' plus one. It seems to be taking count of 1's and adding a shifted copy in additional row.
      - The transformed output only created 2 rows. Only a diagonal was filled.

    match: False
    observations:
      - The input has one '2' (red).
      - The output expands to four rows.
      - The transformed output only has one row.

    match: False
    observations:
      - Input has three '5's (gray).
      - Output has five rows.
      - The transformed output only has three rows.
