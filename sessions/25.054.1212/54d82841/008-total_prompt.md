## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47F93880>

**output:**
```
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47503670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (5x5 in this example) where each cell contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change appears to be the introduction of a single yellow (4) cell in the output, while the other cells mostly remain the same. The location of the yellow cell seems related to the position of green (3) cells.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: green_cells
    color: 3 (green)
    initial_positions: [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3)]
  - object: yellow_cell
    color: 4 (yellow)
    final_position: (4,2)
  - action: find_centroid
    input: green_cells
    description: calculate the approximate center of the green cells
  - action: place_yellow
    input: centroid coordinates
    description: change the color of cell at centroid coordinates to yellow (4)
  - relationship: The row and column position of the yellow cell seems to be the mean of the green cells positions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Objects:** Locate all cells in the input grid that are green (value 3).
2.  **Calculate Centroid:**
    *   Sum the row indices of all green cells.
    *   Sum the column indices of all green cells.
    *   Divide each sum by the number of green cells. If it is float use floor division.
3.  **Place Output Object:** In the output grid, change the cell at the calculated (row, column) coordinates to yellow (value 4).
4.  **Preserve Unchanged:** All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
