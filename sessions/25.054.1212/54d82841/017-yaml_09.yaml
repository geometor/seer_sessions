  - action: populate_row
    description: >
      The new row is populated based on the third-to-last row of the
      input grid.  For each non-zero, distinct value in the
      third-to-last row of the input grid, a '4' (yellow) is placed
      in the corresponding column of the new row. If a cell in
      the third-to-last row of the input grid is '0' (white),
      a '0' (white) is placed in the corresponding column of the new row.
    constraints:
      - Only one '4' is placed for each distinct non-zero color.
