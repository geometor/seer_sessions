## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5
0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7BFC47F93880>

**output:**
```
5 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3
0 3 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions (3x10). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary difference between the input and output is the selective replacement of some '5' (gray) pixels with '3' (green) pixels. The positions of the '0' (white) pixels remain unchanged. It appears that not all '5's are replaced. There is likely a pattern of how the gray pixels change to green.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x10
      elements: integers (0-9)
      element_colors:
          0: white
          3: green
          5: gray
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)
      color:  mapped from value

actions:
  - type: replace
    description: Change the value of a pixel.
    parameters:
      original_value: 5
      new_value: 3
    constraints:
      location: specific, pattern-based

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
    properties:
        rows: 3
        columns: 10
  - type: unchanged
    description: location of '0' (white) pixels remains constant between input
      and output
  - type: conditional_change
    description: some pixels change from '5' to '3' in a specific pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Preservation:** Keep all pixels with the value '0' (white) unchanged.
3.  **Conditional Replacement, Row 1:** In the first row, starting from the right, change the first '5' to '3'. Then if there were any, move two spaces left and change another 5 to a 3.
4.  **Conditional Replacement, Row 2:** In the second row, starting from the left, change the second '5' to a '3'. Then, moving two spaces to the right, change another '5' to '3' if there is one.
5. **Conditional Replacement, Row 3:** In the third row, starting from the middle, change the '5' just left of the center between the two other '5' to '3'.
6.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

Essentially, specific gray (5) pixels are replaced by green (3) pixels based on their position within each row and in relation to other gray pixels within their row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
