objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - id: pixel
    type: integer
    description: Represents a color. Values 0-9.
    values:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow

      8: azure
      9: maroon

actions:
  - name: transform_pixel
    description: Change a gray pixel (5) to a green pixel (3).
    constraints:
      - "Row-dependent rules determine which gray pixels are transformed."
      - "First row: gray pixels are transformed, and at least one position is skipped after an initial change."
      - "Second row: at most, one gray pixel is changed to green"
      - "Third row: gray pixels may be changed to green depending on adjacent pixels"
rules:
  row_1_strategy: "gray pixels are changed, skipping at least one place between changes"
  row_2_strategy: "only change one gray, starting at index 0"
  row_3_strategy: "change based on adjacency, up to three total changes"
