Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid consists of alternating white (0) and blue (1) pixels in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid seems to replace the blue pixels with red (2) pixels, while keeping the white pixels unchanged. The output grid also has different dimensions and the pattern repeats one extra time vertically.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue]
      - pattern: checkerboard
      - dimensions: [6, 3]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red]
      - pattern: checkerboard
      - dimensions: [9, 3]
  - action: color_substitution
    input: blue
    output: red
  - action: repeat_pattern
    axis: vertical
    times: input rows / output rows

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the checkerboard pattern in the input grid, noting the alternating white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Substitute** all blue (1) pixels with red (2) pixels.
3  **Repeat** the original vertical pattern extra time (input grid is length 6 and output grid is length 9 so it is repeated 9/6 = 1.5 times - or one extra half of it's length).
4.  **Maintain** the white (0) pixels unchanged.
5. **Output**: New grid
