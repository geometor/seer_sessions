Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replace all blue pixels (value '1') with red pixels (value '2') and add three rows of the established pattern to the bottom. Preserve all white pixels (value '0').
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy to work on
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Replace all '1' (blue) pixels with '2' (red)
    output_grid[output_grid == 1] = 2
    
    # get shape
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Extend by adding rows of the established pattern
    # Create a new empty array with space for the extended output
    extended_grid = np.zeros((rows + 3, cols), dtype=int)
    
    # copy original over
    extended_grid[:rows, :] = output_grid
        
    # fill using established rows
    extended_grid[6,:] = extended_grid[5,:]
    extended_grid[7,:] = extended_grid[4,:]
    extended_grid[8,:] = extended_grid[5,:]
    

    return extended_grid

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the blue-to-red pixel replacement. However, the pattern extension logic is flawed. It seems to be attempting a simple alternating row copy, which doesn't accurately capture the relationship between rows in all examples. The primary issue is the incorrect row extension at the bottom. Example 2 reveals this issue. The first, second and third extension rows should match the pattern of repeating the last three lines of the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Pattern Extension:** Focus on how rows are related in *all* examples, not just the first.
2.  **Verify Pixel Counts:** Double-check that color transformations are consistent.
3. **Refactor code**: Update existing code to account for new information.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**
I need the dimensions of each input.
```tool_code
import numpy as np

# Provided input grids from the prompt
input_grids = {
    "example_1": np.array([
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 1],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0]
    ]),
    "example_2": np.array([
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 1]
    ]),
    "example_3": np.array([
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0]
    ])
}

# Calculate dimensions for each input grid
dimensions = {key: grid.shape for key, grid in input_grids.items()}
print(dimensions)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
