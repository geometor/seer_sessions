"""

import numpy as np

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Replace all '1' (blue) pixels with '2' (red)
    output_grid[output_grid == 1] = 2

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program was partially correct. It successfully identified the color replacement (blue to red) and the extension of the grid. However, it made an incorrect assumption about *which* rows to repeat at the bottom. It assumed the last three rows of the input should always be repeated, but the examples demonstrate a more complex pattern related to the rows *before* any changes are made. The code also doesn't handle alternating row extensions well, which is evident from the example 2 error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Pattern:** Carefully analyze the input and output pairs, focusing on *how* the bottom rows are constructed in relation to the *original* input rows, paying very close attention to the row indices.
2.  **Precise Row Indexing:** The revised natural language program must explicitly state which rows (by index relative to the *original* input) are replicated and their order at the bottom of the output. It appears to be repeating the entire input grid pattern, not just the last three rows.
3. **Test and iterate** test the program again on the examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of each example, combining provided information with detailed observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (9, 3)
    *   Color Changes: All blue (1) pixels become red (2).
    *   Row Extension Pattern: The last three rows of the output are the first three rows of the original, *before color change*.
    *   Code Result: Incorrect. Repeats the last three rows of the input *after color change*.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (9, 3)
    *   Color Changes: All blue (1) pixels become red (2).
    *   Row Extension Pattern: The last three rows of the output correspond to the original first three rows of the input.
    *   Code Result: Incorrect. Incorrect ordering.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (9, 3)
    *   Color Changes: All blue (1) pixels become red (2).
    *   Row Extension Pattern: The last three rows of the output correspond to the original first three rows of the input.
    *   Code Result: Correct. Fortuitously, since input rows 4,5,6 are the same as rows 1,2,3 in this input, the incorrect logic appears to produce the right output.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1]  # Original colors present
      shape: (rows, cols) # Variable, defined in each example
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2]  # Colors after transformation
      shape: (rows + 3, cols) # 3 rows added

actions:
  - name: color_replacement
    input: input_grid
    output: intermediate_grid # temporary, before extension
    description: Replace all blue (1) pixels with red (2) pixels.
  - name: row_extension
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: >
      Add three rows to the bottom of the grid. These new rows replicate the
      first three rows of the *original* input grid.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Color Swap:** Scan the input grid. Replace every blue pixel (value 1) with a red pixel (value 2). White pixels (value 0) are unchanged.
2.  **Extend Grid:** Create a new, empty grid that has the same number of columns as the input grid, but with three additional rows.
3.  **Copy Original Rows:** Copy all rows of the *original* input grid into the top of the new grid.
4.  **Replicate Rows:** Copy the first three rows of the *original* input grid into the three newly added rows at the bottom of the output grid, maintaining their original order (row 1 to row `rows`, row 2 to row `rows+1`, and row 3 to row `rows+2`).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
