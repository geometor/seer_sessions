Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of single-digit integers. The integers represent different colors. The input grid has two colors (0 and 1, which map to white and blue), and the output grid has two colors (0 and 2, white and red). The output grid is the same size as and appears to derive from the input grid. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6 rows x 3 columns).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x3
      colors: [white, blue]
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x3
      colors: [white, red]
    role: output

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        input: [white, blue]
        output: [white, red]
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: color_change
    description: Change the color of specific pixels based on their original color.
    mapping:
      blue: red

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels maintain their positions from input to output.
  - type: color_correspondence
    description:  Blue pixels in the input correspond to red pixels in the output. White remains white.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an input grid of 6x3 dimensions, containing pixels of colors white (0) and blue (1).

2.  **Color Mapping:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.

3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a pixel is blue (1), change its color to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel is white (0), keep its color as white (0) in the output grid.

4.  **Output:** The result is an output grid of 6x3, with the same pixel positions, but where all blue pixels have been replaced with red pixels, preserving the white pixels. The program takes the input, replaces blue for red and outputs that.
