## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 1 2
1 1 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44367400>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (9x9). The smaller grid's elements (colored pixels) appear to be replicated and repositioned within the larger grid. The larger grid is mostly filled with white pixels (0), with the original grid's content forming two distinct blocks: one in the top-right corner and another in the bottom-left corner. The layout seems to involve creating a 3x3 grid of 3x3 subgrids and inserting the original 3x3 in certain regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color_values: [0, 1, 2]  # white, blue, red
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements:
      - color_values: [0] # predominantly white
        positions: "most positions"
      - color_values: "[input grid colors]"
        positions: "top-right 3x3 block and bottom-left 3x3 block"

  - relation: replication
    description: "The input grid is replicated in the output grid."

  - relation: positioning
    description: "The replicated grids are placed in specific locations within the output grid: top-right and bottom-left."

  - action: transformation
    description: "Transforms a 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid."

  - property: background
    value: 0 #white
    description: "The output grid is padded using value 0."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create a 9x9 grid:** Initialize a new 9x9 grid filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).

2.  **Replicate and Position (Top-Right):** Copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the top-right 3x3 block of the 9x9 output grid. Specifically, place the input grid's top-left element (0,0) at output position (0,6).

3.  **Replicate and Position (Bottom-Left):** Copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the bottom-left 3x3 block of the 9x9 output grid. Specifically, place the input grid's top-left element(0,0) at the output position (6,0).

4.  **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
