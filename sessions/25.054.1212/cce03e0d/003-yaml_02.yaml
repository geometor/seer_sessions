examples:
  - example_id: 1

    transformation: |
        The output combines aspects of the input and includes added columns of zeros. The relationship is more complex than simple translation.

    transformation: |
        the input grid columns appear to be repeated with columns of zeros in between.
        The entire input is repeated on the right side.
