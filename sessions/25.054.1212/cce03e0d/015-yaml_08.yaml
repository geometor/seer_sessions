task: 014
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - id: zero_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 0 (white)
      role: padding or spacing
  - id: input_pixel_block
    type: subgrid
    properties:
       dimensions: variable, seems related to input grid
       role: source for replication in output

actions:
  - name: selective_tile
    description: Replicates specific parts (or the whole) of the input grid into the output grid.
    parameters:
      source: input_grid or a subgrid of it
      destination: output_grid
      placement_rule: "Tiling with zero-interleaving - to be determined precisely"
  - name: insert_zeros
    description: Places zero pixels in the output grid according to a specific pattern.
    parameters:
        locations: "to be determined precisely - seems to alternate with input pixel blocks"
