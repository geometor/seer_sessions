## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 0 0
2 1 0
0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4421AA10>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC44218E20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The input grid contains numbers 0, 1, and 2, representing colors white, blue, and red, respectively. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with the original 3x3 input grid appearing in the top-left corner of a larger, mostly empty 9x9 grid, which is entirely filled with zeros (white) except for the region of the original input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 9x9
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        values: [0, 1, 2]
        colors: [white, blue, red]
actions:
  - type: expansion
    input_grid: 3x3
    output_grid: 9x9
    description: The input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid.
relationships:
  - type: contains
    description: output grid contains the input grid, expanded with 0 padding
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with zeros (white pixels).
2.  **Copy:** Copy the 3x3 input grid onto the top-left corner of the output grid. This means the values from the input grid at position (row, col) are transferred to the same (row, col) in the output grid. Input coordinates (0,0) to (2,2) map directly to output coordinates (0,0) to (2,2).
3. **Output** The 9x9 grid is the result.

In essence, the transformation expands the original grid by adding rows and columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
