Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, correctly identifying the checkerboard pattern and the inversion trigger. However, it's clear from examples 2 and 3 that the inversion logic is flawed.  The code inverts *all* rows below the row containing the '1', and the checkerboard pattern generation also isn't adaptive to different grid sizes and '1' placements.  The core issue is a misinterpretation of *how* the '1' influences the checkerboard pattern. It's not a simple row inversion of the rows *below*, but a more complex shift in the checkerboard pattern *starting* from the row with the '1'. Example 2 and 3 expected outputs clearly show a column-wise flip as well.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Analysis:** Carefully examine *each* example, focusing on the exact position of the '1' in the input and how the checkerboard pattern is altered in the output.  Pay close attention to both row *and* column changes.
2.  **Refine Pattern Recognition:**  The initial assumption of a simple checkerboard needs adjusting.  We need to identify the *precise* rule governing the checkerboard's origin (top-left corner) and how the '1' shifts this origin. It looks like columns may be flipped.
3.  **Modularize:**  Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts: (a) determining the base checkerboard pattern (potentially dependent on grid size), (b) identifying the '1's location, and (c) applying the correct shift/inversion based on the '1'.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:**  After each code adjustment, re-run against *all* training examples to immediately identify any regressions or newly introduced errors.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example, now with pixel counts using code to help:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_str, expected_output_str, transformed_output_str):
    input_grid = np.array([list(map(int, row.split())) for row in input_str.split('\n')])
    expected_grid = np.array([list(map(int, row.split())) for row in expected_output_str.split('\n')])
    transformed_grid = np.array([list(map(int, row.split())) for row in transformed_output_str.split('\n')])

    diff = expected_grid - transformed_grid
    pixels_off = np.count_nonzero(diff)

    match = np.array_equal(expected_grid, transformed_grid)
    size_correct = input_grid.shape == expected_grid.shape
    unique_expected, counts_expected = np.unique(expected_grid, return_counts=True)
    unique_transformed, counts_transformed = np.unique(transformed_grid, return_counts=True)
    
    
    color_palette_correct = np.array_equal(np.sort(unique_expected), np.sort([0,1]))

    correct_pixel_counts = np.array_equal(counts_expected, counts_transformed)
    
    print(f"Match: {match}")
    print(f"Pixels Off: {pixels_off}")
    print(f"Size Correct: {size_correct}")
    print(f"Color Palette Correct: {color_palette_correct}")
    print(f"Correct Pixel Counts: {correct_pixel_counts}")
    if not correct_pixel_counts:
        print(f"  Expected Counts: {dict(zip(unique_expected, counts_expected))}")
        print(f"  Transformed Counts: {dict(zip(unique_transformed, counts_transformed))}")

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with a standard checkerboard pattern starting with 0 in the top-left corner.
2.  **Trigger Identification:** Find the location (row and column) of the pixel with value '1' in the input grid. If no '1' is present, the initial checkerboard is the output.
3. **Checkerboard shift:**
    *   The checkerboard pattern is shifted based on the '1's position. The row containing the '1' becomes the new "top" row of the checkerboard, and the column containing the '1' become the left-most column.
    *   Additionally, there is an inversion on the column:
      * The columns to the left of pixel '1' are inverted.
      * The column containing pixel '1' defines the start value for the checkerboard sequence for columns to the right of the pixel.

This revised natural language program provides a much more precise description of the transformation, capturing the nuances observed in the additional examples. It acknowledges the crucial role of the '1' in defining the *starting point* of the checkerboard, not just inverting existing rows. The column flip is key to the correct transformation.
