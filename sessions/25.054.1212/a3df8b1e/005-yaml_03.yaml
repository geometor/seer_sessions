objects:

    properties:
      colors: [0, 1]  # All inputs contain 0s and potentially a 1
      dimensions: [rows, cols] # variable
      has_trigger: True # presence of '1' triggers transformation

  - object_id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1] # always a two-color grid
      dimensions: [rows, cols] # same as input
      pattern: checkerboard # fundamental pattern

    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 1
      location: [row, col] # row and column index of the '1' in input_grid

    description: "The presence and location of '1' in input determines starting point and potentially column flip of the checkerboard."
