The primary colors involved are white (0) and blue (1). The input grid appears mostly white, with a single blue pixel in the bottom-left corner. The output grid is also mostly white but contains a cross-shaped pattern of blue pixels. The location of the single blue pixel in the input seems to determine the center of the cross in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
