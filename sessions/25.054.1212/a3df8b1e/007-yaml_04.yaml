facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are 10x3 (height x width).
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
      dominant_color: white (0)
      other_colors: [blue (1)]
    description: A rectangular grid with a single blue pixel at [9,0].
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
      dominant_color: white (0)
      other_colors: [blue(1)]
    description: A rectangular grid with a repeating diagonal pattern of blue pixels.
  - relationship: |
      The output grid's blue pixels appear to be derived from the position of the single blue pixel in the input grid.
  - action: transformation
    description: |
      The single blue pixel in the input seems to trigger the creation of a diagonal pattern of blue pixels in the output.
    parameters: None apparent
  - pattern: output_blue_pixels
    description: |
     The blue pixels in the output grid alternate between the first and second columns, repeating a [1,0], [0,1],[1,0] column pattern.
    details: start on the left column [x,0], and the next row up moves to the center column [x-1,1]. The pattern extends to the last column [x-3,2]. The entire pattern repeats down the array and then starts at the bottom left again.
