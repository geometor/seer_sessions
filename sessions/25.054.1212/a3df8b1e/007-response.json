The primary colors involved appear to be white (0) and blue (1). The input grid contains a single blue pixel in the bottom-left corner, while the rest of the grid is white. The output grid has a more complex pattern of blue pixels, resembling a repeating diagonal line.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Note its row and column coordinates (in this case, row 9, column 0).\n\n2.  **Initiate the pattern**: In the output grid, start at the location of the blue pixel of the seed and place a blue pixel in the corresponding location of the output array\n\n3.  **Extend Diagonally Up-Right:**\n    *   Move up one row and right one column.
