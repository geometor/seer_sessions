            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, understanding the expansion of the grid and some form of mirroring/repetition. However, the exact mirroring logic was incorrect, leading to mismatches in all three training examples. The core issue is the column mapping. The original code copies the input's first column to output columns 1 & 3, and the input second column to output columns 0 and 2. It should instead be mirroring the first columnt to output columns 2 and 4 and the second column to 1 and 3.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Mirroring Logic:** Carefully re-examine the input-output pairs to precisely identify how columns are mapped and mirrored.\n2.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Re-write the natural language program to reflect the corrected mirroring logic. Ensure it's unambiguous.\n3. **Update code:** Modify the transform function to correct the column assignments.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations and how they inform the rule:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 2x3 (width x height)\n    *   Output: 4x9\n    *   Size Change: Width doubled, height tripled.\n    *   Observations:\n        *   Input column 0 (0, 0, 0) appears in output columns 1 and 3, with the azure value mapped to 0\n        *   Input column 1 (8, 0, 8) appears in output columns 0 and 2, with the azure value mapped to 0\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 2x3\n    *   Output: 4x9\n    *   Size Change: Width doubled, height tripled.\n      *   Input column 0 (2, 2, 2) appears in output columns 1 and 3.\n        *   Input column 1 (0, 2, 0) appears in output columns 0 and 2.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 2x3\n    *   Output: 4x9\n    *   Size Change: Width doubled, height tripled.\n       *   Input column 0 (0,0,5) appears in output column 1 and 3\n        *   Input column 1 (0, 5, 0) appears in output columns 0 and 2\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 010\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_size: [2, 3]\n    output_size: [4, 9]\n    column_mapping:\n      - input: 0\n        output: [1, 3]\n      - input: 1\n        output: [0, 2]\n    size_transformation:\n      width: doubled\n      height: tripled\n    objects:\n      - description: input grid columns\n        properties:\n          - attribute: content\n            transformation: mirrored and repeated\n\n  - id: 2\n    input_size: [2, 3]\n    output_size: [4, 9]\n    column_mapping:\n       - input: 0\n         output: [1, 3]\n       - input: 1\n         output: [0, 2]\n    size_transformation:\n      width: doubled\n      height: tripled\n    objects:\n      - description: input grid columns\n        properties:\n          - attribute: content\n            transformation: mirrored and repeated\n\n  - id: 3\n    input_size: [2, 3]\n    output_size: [4, 9]\n    column_mapping:\n      - input: 0\n        output: [1,3]\n      - input: 1\n        output: [0, 2]\n    size_transformation:\n      width: doubled\n      height: tripled\n    objects:\n      - description: input grid columns\n        properties:\n          - attribute: content\n            transformation: mirrored and repeated\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Expand Grid:** The output grid's height is three times the input grid's height, and the output grid's width is two times the input grid's width.\n\n2.  **Column Mirroring with Repetition**:\n    *   The first column of the *input* grid is copied to the *second* and *fourth* columns of the output grid.\n    *   The second column of the *input* grid is copied to the *first* and *third* columns of the output grid.\n\n3.  **Vertical Repetition:** Steps 1 and 2 are applied to each set of three rows within output. The entire mirrored pattern is copied downwards, repeating it three times to achieve the tripled height.\n"
