## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0
0 5
5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x7BFC48A60820>

**output:**
```
0 5 5 0
5 0 0 5
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
5 0 0 5
0 5 5 0
0 5 5 0
5 0 0 5
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC475013F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to contain two colors: white (0) and grey (5).  The output grid is significantly larger and also uses only white and grey. The arrangement of greys in the output seems to be related to the positions of grey in the input, but expanded and patterned. The input grid seems to define a 2x2 pattern which is tiled and repeated.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x2 (rows x columns)
      elements: [0, 5]  # white, grey
      description: "The original smaller grid."

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 9x4
      elements: [0, 5]
      description: "The expanded grid, a patterned transformation of the input."

  - relation: input_to_output_size
    properties:
        type: expansion
        details: "Output dimensions seem derived by multiplying with input dimension: rows x3, cols x2"
  - relation: pattern_replication
    type: tiling
    details: "The output is created by repeating a modified version of a 2x2 sub-grid derived from the input grid."
  - object: cell_values
    properties:
        type: color_values
        details: "0 represents white, 5 represents gray"
  - action: transformation
    properties:
        type: expansion_and_pattern_replication
        details: >
           Take a 2x2 sub-grid area from the input. Transform it. Tile to the output grid dimension.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Receive a 3x2 input grid consisting of 0s (white) and 5s (grey).

2.  **Define Sub-Grid:** Extract the top-left 2x2 region of the input grid.
3.  **Transform 2x2:** Rotate the sub-grid 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   Original:
        
```
        0 0
        0 5
        ```

    *  Rotated sub-grid used for expansion:
        
```
        0 5
        0 0
        ```


4. **Output Dimensions** Output grid dimensions will be based on this rule:  `output_rows = input_rows * 3`, `output_cols = input_cols * 2`. Therefore, output grid will have dimensions 9x4.
5.  **Tile and Replicate:** Create the output grid by tiling the transformed 2x2 sub-grid. Replicate across and down.
    * The top-left cell in output will be equal to top-left of sub-grid
    *   Fill the 9x4 output grid using this transformed 2x2 sub-grid.

6. **Output:** return the completed 9x4 output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
