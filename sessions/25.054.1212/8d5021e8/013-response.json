The input grid appears to contain two colors: white (0) and grey (5).  The output grid is significantly larger and also uses only white and grey. The arrangement of greys in the output seems to be related to the positions of grey in the input, but expanded and patterned. The input grid seems to define a 2x2 pattern which is tiled and repeated.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
