## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 8
0 0
0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x7BFC47FBADA0>

**output:**
```
8 0 0 8
0 0 0 0
8 0 0 8
8 0 0 8
0 0 0 0
8 0 0 8
8 0 0 8
0 0 0 0
8 0 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC47FBA1A0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid-based transformation. The input is a 3x2 grid (3 rows, 2 columns) of digits, and the output is a 9x4 grid. The digits represent colors (0 for white and 8 for azure). The azure pixels seem to define a pattern that gets expanded in the output. The primary operation is an expansion or replication of the input grid, where the initial grid gets scaled. The shape isn't maintained, but a new, larger grid formed.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements: [0, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements: [0, 8]
  - relationship: expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    properties:
      - horizontal_factor: 2
      - vertical_factor: 3
      - pattern_replication: true
  - action: replication
    agent: input grid
    target: output grid
  - colors:
      0 : white
      8: azure

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe the input grid:** Identify the dimensions (3x2) and the arrangement of colored pixels (0 and 8).
2.  **Expand the grid:** Create an output_grid with the shape of the input grid scaled times two in columns and scaled times three in rows
3.  **Replicate the pattern:** Copy each value of the input array cell into a corresponding 3x2 subgrid within the output, effectively replicating pattern.

Essentially, input is scaled to 3 times the height and 2 times the width. Each cell is translated to shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
