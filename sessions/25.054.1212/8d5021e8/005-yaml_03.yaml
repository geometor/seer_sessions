summary: |
  The input grid is transformed into an output grid where each column is repeated three times, and within that repeated block, there is also a vertical repetition of colors.
objects:
  input_grid:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  output_grid:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x6
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    transformation: |
      Each column from the input grid expands to three columns in the output grid by repeating the values vertically.
      Each column from the input grid expands into 2 columns.
      The whole output grid expands to 3 times the height and two times the width of the input grid.
