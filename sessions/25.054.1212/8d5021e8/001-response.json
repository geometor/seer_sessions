The input is a 3x2 grid (3 rows, 2 columns) of digits, and the output is a 9x4 grid. The digits represent colors (0 for white and 8 for azure). The azure pixels seem to define a pattern that gets expanded in the output. The primary operation is an expansion or replication of the input grid, where the initial grid gets scaled. The shape isn't maintained, but a new, larger grid formed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
