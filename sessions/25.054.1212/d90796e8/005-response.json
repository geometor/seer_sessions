            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy was on the right track by focusing on row-wise operations and adjacency of non-zero, non-grey cells. However, the multiplication hack in example 1 revealed a significant flaw: it added context from just one case. It's clear the transformation isn't simply summing adjacent different colors, and my handling of multiple color values in a row requires rethinking, and needs to respect order more carefully.\n\nThe key error seems to stem from incorrect summation logic and the misinterpretation of how colors interact. The 'sum' should be placed on the left, and non-zero, non grey should turn to zero.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Remove the hack:** Eliminate the arbitrary multiplication by 4.\n2.  **Revisit Adjacency and Summation:** Correctly implement the summation of *adjacent* *different* non-zero, non-grey cells within each row. Place this sum at the leftmost, change all summed to zero.\n3. **Iterate and Compare** examine where each example is succeeding and failing\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]]`\n    *   Transformed Output: `[[14, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]]`\n    *   Analysis: first row, the transform should result in `3 + 2*VALUE = 8`. The transformed output has 3 * 4 + 2 = 14, reflecting a bad initial strategy.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Transformed Output: `[[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 14, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *    Analysis: row 2 is correct in setting leftmost value and zeroing the right, but has wrong value, row 4 sets left, but not right, and has wrong value, and row 6 only considers the first of a sequence.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [5, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Transformed Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [17, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Analysis: Row 1 and 2: lose non-grey/non-zero colors that are not adjacent. row 3, 5: zero out non-adjacent, but sum includes self (2+3 = 5, correct, my code gets 2 + 3 + 2*3). row 6, two pairs, but sum includes self.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - description: \"Operations are performed row-wise.\"\n    type: procedural\n  - description: \"Grey (5) cells are copied to the output unchanged.\"\n    type: \"copy_rule\"\n  - description: \"Zero (0) cells remain zero unless they are part of adjacent summation\"\n    type: \"conditional_rule\"\n  - description: \"Within each row, consecutive sequences of adjacent, different, non-zero, and non-grey colored cells are summed.\"\n    type: \"summation_rule\"\n  - description: \"The sum replaces the leftmost cell in a summed sequence.\"\n    type: \"positional_rule\"\n  - description: \"All other cells in summed sequence become zero.\"\n    type: \"positional_rule\"\n  - description: \"Isolated cells (those not adjacent to a different color) are set to zero\"\n    type: \"conditional_rule\"\n  - description: \"2 * VALUE always contributes to adjacent summation\"\n    type: \"constant\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify** sequences of *adjacent* cells within the row that meet *all* these criteria:\n    *   The cell's value is not 0 (white).\n    *   The cell's value is not 5 (grey).\n    *   The cell's value is different from its immediate neighbor(s) within the sequence.\n3.  **Calculate Sum:** For each identified sequence:\n    * if a cell is adjacent to a cell with a different, non-zero, and non-grey value, add the two together\n    * if the added value is 2, multiply by VALUE, then add to the sum of the sequence\n4.  **Leftmost Placement:** Replace the value of the *leftmost* cell in the sequence with the calculated sum.\n5.  **Zeroing:** Set the values of *all other* cells within that identified sequence to 0.\n6. **Isolated Cell Handling**: Any non-zero, non-grey cell that is *not* part of an adjacent sequence (as defined in step 2) is set to 0 in the output.\n7.  **Copy Unchanged:** All cells that are not part of an identified sequence (i.e., 0 (white) or 5 (grey) cells) are copied directly from the input to the output without modification.\n"
