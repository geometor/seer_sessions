            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding derived from the first training example. It correctly identified the \"Green then Red\" adjacency rule but implemented it incompletely, and it also partially and incorrectly implemented the \"Red then Green\" rule. The core issue is that the code modifies the grid *in place* during iteration. When it changes a green pixel to azure in the \"Green then Red\" case, it doesn't subsequently check if that *newly created* azure pixel is next to a *previously existing* red pixel. Similarly, when a red pixel changes to azure due to the \"red then green\" adjacency, the next pixel is skipped and not evaluated. The results show mismatches in multiple examples, especially where sequences of \"Green then Red\" or \"Red then Green\" occur. The updated strategy will focus on preventing updates from interfering with future pixel checks within the same iteration.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations from the results.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `3 2 0; 0 0 0; 0 5 0`\n    *   Expected: `8 0 0; 0 0 0; 0 5 0`\n    *   Actual: `8 2 0; 0 0 0; 0 5 0`\n    *   Issue: The '2' (red) pixel next to the changed green pixel remains. It should not. It changes if followed by green.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `5 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 3 2 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 3 0 0 0 2; 0 2 0 0 0 0; 5 0 0 3 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected: `5 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 8 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 8 0 0 0 2; 0 0 0 0 0 0; 5 0 0 3 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Actual: `5 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 8 2 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 3 0 0 0 2; 0 2 0 0 0 0; 5 0 0 3 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Issues:\n        1.  Row 2: The '2' (red) pixel remains; should be azure as it *was* adjacent to '3' (green)\n        2.  Row 4: The '3' should become '8'.\n        3. Row 5: The 2 should not change as there is not a green to the right.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `0 0 0 0 0 2 0; 3 0 0 0 0 0 3; 5 0 2 3 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 2 0; 3 2 0 0 0 3 0; 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected: `0 0 0 0 0 2 0; 3 0 0 0 0 0 3; 5 0 0 8 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 8 0 0 0 0 8 0; 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`\n    *   Actual: `0 0 0 0 0 2 0; 3 0 0 0 0 0 3; 5 0 8 8 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0 2 0; 8 2 0 0 0 3 0; 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`\n    *   Issues:\n      1.  Row 3: only first azure.\n      2. Row 5: The red 2 does not change\n      3. Row 6: The red 2 should not change. The Green at col 5 should change.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: green\n    value: 3\n    shape: pixel\n    action: change_to_azure_if_followed_by_red\n  - color: red\n    value: 2\n    shape: pixel\n    action: change_to_azure_if_followed_by_green\n  - color: azure\n    value: 8\n    shape: pixel\n    context: result_of_adjacency\n\nrules:\n  - condition: green pixel immediately followed by a red pixel horizontally\n    action: change the green pixel to azure\n  - condition: red pixel immediately followed by a green pixel horizontally\n    action: change both the red and green pixels to azure\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Locate Green and Red:** Identify pixels that are green (3) or red (2).\n3.  **Horizontal Adjacency Check (Green then Red):** If a pixel is green (3) and the pixel immediately to its *right* is red (2), change *only* the green pixel to azure (8).\n4.  **Horizontal Adjacency Check (Red then Green):** If a pixel is red (2) and the pixel immediately to its *right* is green (3), change *both* the red pixel and the green pixel to azure (8).\n5.  **Preservation:** All other pixels remain unchanged. Do not evaluate cells after they have changed.\n\nKey changes from the prior program are bolded - and are intended to clarify the\nlogic for application of the rule during the iteration. The \"do not evaluate\ncells after they have changed\" will be essential to get correct in the code.\n"
