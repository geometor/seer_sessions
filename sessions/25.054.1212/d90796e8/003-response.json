            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it's clear that it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that the initial program *only* considers the top row. The other examples demonstrate that the summation and replacement rule applies to *multiple* rows, and potentially under different conditions (e.g., adjacency to other colored cells). The strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Identify the common pattern across all examples:** It's not just about the top row. It seems to involve summing non-zero, non-grey values *within a row or region*, and placing the sum in a specific location *within that row or region*, zeroing the original summed values.\n2.  **Determine the conditions for applying the rule:** When is a row/region subject to this summation? Is it all rows, or are there specific criteria (like the presence of certain colors)?\n3. **Determine the position of the summed value:** The initial assumption (top-left cell) is wrong. The position could change per row and is likely related to the adjacency of other colors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere is an assessment of the training data and the transformed outputs from\nthe code provided.\n\n*Example 1*:\n - input shape: (3, 3)\n - output shape: (3, 3)\n - Top row has non-zero, non-grey values (3 and 2).\n - expected: Their sum (5) *should have 3 added*, making 8, and it should replace 3 in the\n   top-left\n - actual: Their sum (5) replaces the top-left cell, and input cells\n   are zeroed correctly.\n - The logic worked, but *the sum should have been adjusted somehow*.\n\n*Example 2*:\n - input shape: (7, 6)\n - output shape: (7, 6)\n - Row 2 has non-zero, non-grey values (3 and 2). The expected sum, 8 is placed in the *same row*.\n - Row 4 has non-zero, non-grey values (3 and 2). The sum is 8, replacing the *first* 3.\n - Row 6 has non-zero/grey values 5, 3. The 3 stays put.\n - actual: Only did transform on the top row.\n\n*Example 3*:\n - input shape: (7, 7)\n - output shape: (7, 7)\n - Row 3 has non-zero/non-grey values 2, 3. The expected output shows\n   their sum (8) in between them.\n - Row 5 has non-zero, non-grey values of 2. The expected output has\n   zeroed it.\n - Row 6 has non-zero, non-grey values (3 and 2 and 3). Their sum (8) is\n   placed in place of the 3's.\n - actual: Only did transform on the top row.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    objects:\n      - row: 0\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [3, 2]\n        sum_location: [0, 0]\n        sum_value: 8\n        zeroed_cells: [[0,0], [0,1]]\n  - example: 2\n    objects:\n      - row: 1\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [3, 2]\n        sum_location: [1, 2]\n        sum_value: 8\n        zeroed_cells: [[1,2],[1,3]]\n      - row: 3\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [3, 2]\n        sum_location: [3, 1]\n        sum_value: 8\n        zeroed_cells: [[3,1], [3,5]]\n      - row: 5\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [3] # Only one\n        sum_location: [5,3]\n        sum_value: 3 # unchanged\n        zeroed_cells: []\n\n  - example: 3\n    objects:\n      - row: 2\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [2, 3]\n        sum_location: [2, 3]\n        sum_value: 8\n        zeroed_cells: [[2,3], [2,2]]\n      - row: 5\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [3,2,3]\n        sum_location: [5, 0]\n        sum_value: 8\n        zeroed_cells: [[5,0], [5,1], [5,5]]\n      - row: 4\n        non_zero_non_grey_cells: [2]\n        sum_location: [4,5]  #the original location of 2\n        sum_value: 0 # the value is zeroed\n        zeroed_cells: [[4,5]]\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify** all non-zero and non-grey (value not equal to 5) cells within the *current row*.\n3. **Check Adjacency:**\n    * If a cell is adjacent to a different non-zero and non-grey cell *in the\n      same row*, *sum* all such adjacent cells and place this sum in place of the\n      *leftmost* of the summed numbers.\n    * Change the value to 0 for all non-zero, non-grey cells that were summed.\n    * if a cell is not adjacent to any other non-zero and non-grey cell, set its value to 0 in the output.\n4.  **Copy** all other cells (grey cells or cells not meeting the above criteria) directly from the input grid to the output grid without changes.\n\nKey Changes and Reasoning:\n\n*   **Row-wise Iteration:** The transformation applies independently to each row.\n*   **Adjacency:** The rule isn't about *all* non-zero/non-grey cells in a row, but specifically those *adjacent* to each other within that row.\n*   **Sum Placement:** The sum replaces the leftmost of the values summed in the *current* row.\n* **Zeroing cells:** If a number in the row is not adjacent to another\n    non-zero/non-grey, set it to 0.\n*   **Handling of solitary colored values:** Values that aren't 0 or grey and that are *not* adjacent to any other non-zero and non-grey should be zeroed.\n"
