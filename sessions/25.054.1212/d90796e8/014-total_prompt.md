## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 2 0
3 0 0 0 0 0 3
5 0 2 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 2 0
3 2 0 0 0 3 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7BFC4423D990>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 2 0
3 0 0 0 0 0 3
5 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, broken down into perceptions, a YAML block of facts, and a natural language program.

**Perceptions:**

*   The input and output grids are the same size (7x7).
*   Most of the grid cells are white (value 0).
*   There are a few non-zero colored pixels in the input: red (2), green (3), and gray (5).
*   The output grid maintains some of the input colors (gray (5) and one red (2)) in their original locations.
*	The green(3) pixels remain in place.
*   Some red (2) and green (3) pixels in the input grid are replaced by azure (8) in the output.
*   The transformation seems to be specific to the relationship between red and green, converting some instances to azure.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
        - green (3)
        - gray (5)
        - azure (8)
      position: [row, column]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent."
actions:
  - type: replace_color
    input_color: [red, green]
    output_color: azure
    condition: specific spatial relationship (to be determined)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all red (2), green (3), and gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve** gray (5) pixels; they remain unchanged in the output.
2.  **Preserve** one of the red(2) pixels; they remain unchanged in the output.
3.  **Locate** instances where a red (2) pixel and a green (3) are in specific positions, the red being to the SW and NE of a green.
4.  **Replace** these green and red by the colour azure (8).
5. **Preserve** the location of green pixels.
6.  All other cells remain white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
