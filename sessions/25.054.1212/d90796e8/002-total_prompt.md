## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 2 0
0 0 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44391690>

**output:**
```
8 0 0
0 0 0
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC443923B0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid with single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with single-digit integers (0-9), seemingly derived from the input.
*   **Transformation:** It appears that some colored pixels in the input grid are modified or have their values altered. Specifically, non-zero, non-grey pixels in the top row of the input grid are summed, and the sum replaces the first value, while these summed input pixels are then set to 0. The grey pixel (value 5) remains unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - object: Grid cells with values 0-9.
  - property: Cell values represent colors.
  - action: Summation of specific cell values in the top row.
  - action: Replacement of the first cell's value with the sum.
  - action: Original summed cells changed to 0.
  - relationship: The grey colored cell remains unchanged.
  - relationship: Top row non-zero, non-grey values are summed and the result placed in the top-left cell.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero and non-grey (not equal to 5) cells in the top row of the input grid.
2.  Sum the values of these identified cells.
3.  Replace the value of the top-left cell (first cell) in the output grid with this sum.
4. Set values of the summed cells of the top row in the input to 0 in the output grid.
5.  Copy all other cells, which are not located in the top row or are grey, from the input grid to the output grid without changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
