            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the need to preserve gray pixels and consider red and green pixels, it failed to accurately capture the *conditional* replacement of red and green with azure. The core issue is that the initial program preserved *all* the non replaced red and green pixels, which lead to the mismatches in all examples. The program needs to consider that the pixels are replaced *only* under the diagonal adjacency condition.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Condition:** The natural language program needs to emphasize that the azure replacement happens *only* when red and green pixels are diagonally adjacent (NE or SW). The code did use the correct calculation, but it didn't apply it conditionally when replacing the other red and green pixels.\n2.  **Prioritize Replacement:** The code must consider changing pixels to azure as a primary task before preserving them to their initial color.\n3. **Background:** Be explicit about filling non-gray, non-replaced pixels with white.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Simple 3x3 grid.\n    *   **Error:** Red and green pixels were preserved.\n    *   **Observation:** The red and green pixels *are* SW/NE diagonally adjacent.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Larger 7x6 grid.\n    *   **Error:** One red-green pair was correctly replaced. However, the remaining pixels were preserved when they should be turned white.\n    *   **Observation:** Highlights the need to handle non-replaced pixels correctly.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** 7x7 grid.\n    *   **Error:** The red-green pairs that should be replaced by azure were not, and some other pixels weren't removed.\n    *   **Observation:** More complex diagonal relationships, confirming the need for the correct adjacency check and conditional replacement.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      cols: variable\n      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors\n  - name: pixel\n    type: element\n    properties:\n      color: integer (0-9)\n      row: integer\n      col: integer\n      is_gray: boolean (true if color is 5)\n      is_red: boolean (true if color is 2)\n      is_green: boolean (true if color is 3)\n      is_azure: boolean (true if color is 8)\n      replaced: boolean (initially false, true if part of a replaced pair)\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_pixels\n    description: Locate pixels of a specific color.\n  - name: check_adjacency\n    description: Determine if a red and green pixel are diagonally adjacent (NE or SW).\n  - name: replace_pixels\n    description: Change the color of red and green pixels to azure if they are diagonally adjacent.\n  - name: preserve_gray\n    description: Keep gray pixels unchanged.\n  - name: clear_unrelated\n    description: Change every pixel that doesn't meet any replacement condition to white.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with an output grid filled entirely with white (0).\n2.  **Preserve Gray:** Identify all gray (5) pixels in the input grid. Copy these pixels to the same positions in the output grid, maintaining their color.\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:**\n    *   Locate all red (2) and green (3) pixels in the input grid.\n    *   For each red pixel, check if a green pixel exists diagonally adjacent to it in either the Northeast (NE) or Southwest (SW) direction.\n    *   If such a diagonally adjacent green pixel is found, replace *both* the red and green pixels with azure (8) in the output grid.\n4.  **Clear Remaining:** After processing all red and green pixels, any cell in the output grid that is not gray (5) or azure (8) should be set to white (0). This ensures that only the replaced pairs and the preserved gray pixels remain.\n"
