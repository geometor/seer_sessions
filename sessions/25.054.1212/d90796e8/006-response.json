Identify sequences of *adjacent* cells within the row that meet *all* these criteria:\n    *   The cell's value is not 0 (white).\n    *   The cell's value is not 5 (grey).\n    *   The cell's value is different from its immediate neighbor(s) within the sequence.\n3.  Calculate Sum:** For each identified sequence:\n    *   Sum the values of all cells in the sequence.  If value 2 is involved, multiple by 2.\n4.  Leftmost Placement:** Replace the value of the *leftmost* cell in the sequence with the calculated sum.\n5.  Zeroing:** Set the values of *all other* cells within that identified sequence to 0.\n6.  Isolated Cell Handling**: Any non-zero, non-grey cell that is *not* part of an adjacent sequence (as defined in step 2) is set to 0 in the output.\n7.  Copy Unchanged:** All cells that are not part of an identified sequence (i.e., 0 (white) or 5 (grey) cells) are copied directly from the input to the output without modification.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid as a copy of input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each row\n    for r in range(rows):\n        colored_indices = []\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0 and input_grid[r, c] != 5:\n                colored_indices.append(c)\n\n        # process the colored cells\n        if len(colored_indices) > 0:\n          \n          summed_indices = []\n          sum_val = 0\n          i = 0\n          while i < len(colored_indices):\n            current_val = input_grid[r, colored_indices[i]]\n            current_sum = current_val\n            current_sequence = [colored_indices[i]]\n            \n            j = i + 1\n            while j < len(colored_indices):\n                next_val = input_grid[r, colored_indices[j]]\n                if next_val != current_val:\n                    current_sum += next_val\n                    current_sequence.append(colored_indices[j])\n                    j += 1\n\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            \n            if len(current_sequence) > 1: # adjacent and different\n                if 2 in [input_grid[r,x] for x in current_sequence]:\n                      current_sum = 0\n                      for x in current_sequence:\n                        if input_grid[r,x] == 2:\n                            current_sum = current_sum + (input_grid[r,x] * 3)\n                        else:\n                            current_sum += input_grid[r,x]\n                output_grid[r, current_sequence[0]] = current_sum\n                for k in range(1, len(current_sequence)):\n                  output_grid[r, current_sequence[k]] = 0\n\n            elif len(current_sequence) == 1:\n                output_grid[r, current_sequence[0]] = 0\n\n            i = j\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
