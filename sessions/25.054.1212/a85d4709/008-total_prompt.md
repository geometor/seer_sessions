## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93490>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of single-digit numbers (representing colors) to another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains two distinct colors (0 and 5, which are white and gray), while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (3, which is green). The key observation is that the non-white color in the input (gray) is replaced, and all other colors are replaced as well, with the single green color in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of integers.
    dimensions: Identical for input and output.
    values: Integers in the range 0-9, representing colors.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 5] # White and Gray
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      colors: [3] # Green
  - transformation: replacement
    description: All pixel values change.
    input_color: 5
    output_color: 3
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description: Input grid transforms to output grid.
    rule: "all pixels are assigned to the same color"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the dimensions of the input grid.** The output grid will have the same dimensions.
2.  **Set all of the pixels in the output grid to be the value '3'.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
