## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 5 0
0 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47587CA0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
3 3 3
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48909C90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both 3x3 grids. The input grid contains `0` (white) and `5` (gray) pixels. The output grid contains `4` (yellow) and `3` (green) pixels. The positions of non-zero pixels in input appear to correspond to positions of changed values in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    input_values: [0, 5]
    output_values: [3, 4]

observations:
  - input_gray_pixels:
      count: 3
      positions: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)]
  - input_white_pixels:
      count: 6
      positions:  [(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2)]
  - output_yellow_pixels :
      count: 6
      positions: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
  - output_green_pixels:
    count: 3
    positions: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)]

actions:
  - replace_value:
      from: 0
      to: 4
      condition: "if the original value is 0"
  - replace_value:
      from: 5
      to: 3
      condition: "If the original value is 5"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If a pixel's value is 0 (white), change it to 4 (yellow) in the output grid.
3.  If a pixel's value is 5 (gray), change it to 3 (green) in the output grid.
4. The size and shape of the grid does not change.

Essentially the transformation replaces 0s with 4s and 5s with 3s.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
