## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48908160>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the values 0 and 5, while the output grid contains 2, 3, and 4. It seems that there's a direct mapping or replacement of values rather than a spatial or geometric transformation. The positions of the numbers do not seem to be relevant, only their values.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    role: input
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    role: output

actions:
  - type: value_replacement
    description: Each input value is mapped to a different output value.

relationships:
  - type: direct_mapping
    description: Input values 0 and 5 are consistently replaced.
    mapping:
      0: 3
      5: 2
      other_value: 4

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Replace all occurrences of the integer 0 with the integer 3.
    *   Replace all occurrences of the integer 5 with the integer 2.
    *   Replace all other integers with integer 4.
3.  **Output:** The modified 3x3 grid.

Essentially, this is a simple color substitution cipher applied to the grid. The program describes a value substitution or color replacement process, where specified integers are changed to other specified integers.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
