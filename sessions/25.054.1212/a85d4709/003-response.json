            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple color replacement rule, and it's clear from the test results that this rule is incorrect, or at least incomplete. The code doesn't correctly predict the output in any of the provided examples. A significant issue is the inconsistent mapping of input colors to output colors. We need to carefully re-examine the input-output pairs to identify the *actual* transformation rule, and how it should be expressed to work correctly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Disregard the initial, flawed interpretation. Go back to the raw input/output pairs for *all* examples and look for consistent patterns.\n2.  **Focus on *All* Mappings:** Pay close attention to *every* color transformation that occurs, not just a select few.\n3.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate a new, more comprehensive rule that explains *all* observed transformations. Then we can create a refined natural language program.\n4.  Consider position and neighbors: We should analyze and note if neighboring colors have any bearing on the outcome.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI'll provide a structured analysis of each example, and focus on getting all of the color changes correct.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input:\n        ```\n        0 0 5\n        0 5 0\n        5 0 0\n        ```\n    *   Expected Output:\n        ```\n        3 3 2\n        3 2 3\n        2 3 3\n        ```\n    *   Observations:\n        *   0 -> 3 in the top-left, top-middle, middle-left, and bottom-middle.\n        *   0 -> 2 in the middle.\n        *   5 -> 2 in the top-right.\n        *    5 -> 3 in the bottom-right\n        *   5 -> 2 in the middle-right, bottom-left\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input:\n        ```\n        0 0 5\n        0 0 5\n        0 0 5\n        ```\n    *   Expected Output:\n        ```\n        3 3 2\n        3 3 2\n        3 3 2\n        ```\n    *   Observations:\n        *   All 0s become 3s.\n        *   All 5s become 2s.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input:\n        ```\n        5 0 0\n        0 5 0\n        5 0 0\n        ```\n    *   Expected Output:\n        ```\n        2 3 3\n        3 2 3\n        2 3 3\n        ```\n    *   Observations:\n        *   All 0s become 3s.\n        *   All 5s becomes 2s.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input:\n        ```\n        0 5 0\n        0 0 5\n        0 5 0\n        ```\n    *   Expected Output:\n        ```\n        3 2 3\n        3 3 2\n        3 2 3\n        ```\n    *   Observations:\n      * All 0s become 3\n      * All 5s become 2\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_colors: [0, 5]\n    output_colors: [2, 3]\n    transformations:\n      - input: 0\n        output: 3\n        locations: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [2,1]]\n      - input: 0\n        output: 2\n        locations: [[1,1]]\n      - input: 5\n        output: 2\n        locations: [[0,2], [1,2], [2,0]]\n      - input: 5\n        output: 3\n        locations: [[2,2]]\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_colors: [0, 5]\n    output_colors: [2, 3]\n    transformations:\n      - input: 0\n        output: 3\n        locations: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,0], [2,1]]\n      - input: 5\n        output: 2\n        locations: [[0,2], [1,2], [2,2]]\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_colors: [0, 5]\n    output_colors: [2, 3]\n    transformations:\n      - input: 0\n        output: 3\n        locations:  [[0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]\n      - input: 5\n        output: 2\n        locations: [[0,0], [1,1], [2,0]]\n\n  - example_id: 4\n    input_colors: [0, 5]\n    output_colors: [2, 3]\n    transformations:\n      - input: 0\n        output: 3\n        locations: [[0,0], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [2,0], [2,2]]\n      - input: 5\n        output: 2\n        locations: [[0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nBased on a review of *all* examples, the transformation rule is:\n\n1.
