            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was based on a simple pattern replacement of white (0) pixels, influenced by the nearest non-zero neighbor to the left. The results show a consistent mismatch, indicating the pattern and its starting point are not correctly determined. The program consistently uses the \\[6, 3, 3] pattern when it sees 5 to the left, regardless of the colors that follow this. It also completely ignores the colors and patterns to the *right* of each 5, and it does not account for the correct color transitions observed in the expected outputs. The error isn't just about the specific colors, but also in how the colors relate to the color 5 and its surrounding context.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze all three input/output pairs, paying close attention to *all* non-zero pixels, not just the ones to the left, but around the grey (5) colored pixels.\n2.  **Identify Correct Patterns:** Determine the exact patterns used in *each* case, and how these patterns depend on the surrounding context. Consider the color 5, and the pixels to the right of it.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately capture the relationship between the input and output grids, including pattern identification and positioning. It appears that the patterns are seeded based on the values that follow each 5.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, now observing the colors to the right of the 5s:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `1 1 2 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected Output: `1 1 2 5 4 4 1 5 1 4 4`\n    *   Observation: The pattern after the first 5 is 4, 4, 1. This appears to be using the next three colors that follow a 5, and restarting whenever another 5 appears.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `6 3 3 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected Output: `6 3 3 5 6 6 6 5 2 3 6`\n    *   Observation: First 5 has a pattern of 6,6,6 that fills to the next 5. The next five has a pattern of 2,3,6 to the end of the line. This is again using the next three colors that follow a 5, and restarting whenever another 5 appears, or continuing to the end of the line.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `2 7 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`\n    *   Expected Output: `2 7 8 5 8 7 2 5 8 8 8`\n    *    Observation: First 5 has a pattern of 8,7,2 that fills to the next 5. The next five has a pattern of 8,8,8 to the end of the line. This is again using the next three colors that follow a 5, and restarting whenever another 5 appears, or continuing to the end of the line.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: 3\n      cols: 11\n      elements: integers 0-9\n      meaning: colors\n\n  - object: transformation_rule\n    properties:\n        trigger: \"presence of grey (5)\"\n        seed: \"three digits following 5\"\n        pattern_replacement: \"replaces white (0) pixels\"\n        pattern_behavior: \"continues until next 5 or end of row\"\n\n  - object: example_1\n    type: input-output\n    input: [ [1, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [4, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] ]\n    output: [ [1, 1, 2, 5, 4, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 4], [4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4], [4, 4, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 1] ]\n\n  - object: example_2\n    type: input-output\n    input: [ [6, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 3, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] ]\n    output: [ [6, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 2, 3, 6], [6, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 6], [6, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 6] ]\n\n  - object: example_3\n    type: input-output\n    input:  [ [2, 7, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] ]\n    output: [ [2, 7, 8, 5, 8, 7, 2, 5, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 8, 5, 8, 7, 7, 5, 8, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 7, 2] ]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Seeds:** For each row in the input grid, find all occurrences of the color grey (5).\n2.  **Extract Pattern:** For each grey (5) pixel, extract the next three color values immediately to its right. These three values form the repeating pattern for that section. If there are fewer than three values before another 5 or the end of the row, extract what is available.\n3.  **Replace White Pixels:** Starting from the grey (5) pixel, replace the subsequent white (0) pixels to the right with the extracted pattern. Repeat the pattern as many times as necessary.\n4. **Continue or Restart Pattern:** If another grey (5) pixel is encountered before the end of the row, start a new pattern based on that pixel using Step 2. If the edge of the grid is reached before a grey (5), continue the existing pattern to the end of the row. If a non-zero, non-white pixel is encountered that is not part of the pattern, do not change it.\n\nThis revised program accounts for the observed behavior across all three examples, using the values after '5' to define the filling pattern, and restarting at subsequent 5's.\n"
