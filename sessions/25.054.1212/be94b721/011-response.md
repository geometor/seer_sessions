"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-zero color in the input grid.  Each region is an object.
2.  **Select Object:** Select the *largest* object in the input grid (based on the total number of pixels, or perhaps the area of the bounding box). If there are multiple objects with the same largest size, it is unclear what happens - we might need to examine the data more.
3.  **Create Output Grid**: Create a new output grid that has the *same dimensions* as the selected object's bounding box (same width and height).
4.  **Copy and Move Object:** Copy the selected object to the new grid. The selected object is moved to the top-left corner (position 0,0) of the output grid.
5. **Output:** The output is this new grid.
