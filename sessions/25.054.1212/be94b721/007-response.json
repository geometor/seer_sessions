The output appears to be a smaller grid containing only one color from the input grid. The size and shape of the output grid are significantly different from the input. The example shows distinct colored regions (objects) in the input. The most prominent colors, besides white (0), are green (3), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The output grid consists solely of yellow (4) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
