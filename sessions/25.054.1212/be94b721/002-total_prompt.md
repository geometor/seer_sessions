## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=832x448 at 0x7BFC48A63190>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x7BFC4757DCF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains multiple colored regions (represented by digits 0-9, where 0 is white and other digits represent specific colors: 2=red, 3=green, 1=blue). The output grid seems to focus on a single color (red, represented by '2') from the input. The other colors and the white background are discarded. The spatial arrangement of the selected color (red) is preserved in a compressed form. The output grid only contains the specified color and white pixels, all other colors have been removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # White, Blue, Red, Green
      dimensions: [7, 13]
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2]       # White, Red
      dimensions: [4, 3]
  - id: red_region
    type: object
    properties:
      color: 2  # Red
      shape: irregular
    location:
      input:  "Contiguous block in top-left quadrant"
      output: "Entire output grid"

actions:
  - type: select
    agent: system
    target: red_region
    description: "The system selects the red region from the input grid."
  - type: compress
    agent: system
    target: red_region
    description: "The system compresses the selected region, removing whitespace and other colors."
  - type: discard
    agent: system
    target: "[colors other than 0 and 2]"
    description: all pixels of any color that is not white (0) or red (2) are removed

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    source: red_region (input)
    target: red_region (output)
    description: "The spatial configuration of the red region is roughly preserved during compression."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Locate the contiguous region of red (value '2') pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Isolate:** Discard all pixels that are not part of the target red region.
3.  **Compress:** Remove all white (value '0') rows and columns that contain *only* white pixels, effectively shrinking the grid to tightly enclose the red region. The remaining red region constitutes the core of the output.
4. The result is the output grid.

Essentially, the program extracts and compresses the red region while preserving its overall shape and discarding all other colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
