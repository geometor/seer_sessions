The input grid contains multiple colored regions (represented by digits 0-9, where 0 is white and other digits represent specific colors: 2=red, 3=green, 1=blue). The output grid seems to focus on a single color (red, represented by '2') from the input. The other colors and the white background are discarded. The spatial arrangement of the selected color (red) is preserved in a compressed form. The output grid only contains the specified color and white pixels, all other colors have been removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
