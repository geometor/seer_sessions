            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and an updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code are incorrect. The initial hypothesis was to extract rows and columns containing the color green (value 3). However, the examples demonstrate a more general pattern that applies to *any* non-zero color, not just green. All training examples use '0' as a background, and builds a sub-grid by looking for the rows and colums containing the same, non-zero, values. The initial code failed to achieve this, and also mistakenly extracted extra columns in Example 5, and produced an empty output in examples 1-4.\n\nThe core issue is that the code is too specific (only looking for '3') and the implementation of keeping rows/columns is flawed. The strategy for resolving the errors is to:\n\n1.  **Generalize the color:** Instead of looking for '3', the code should identify the non-zero colors present in the input.\n2. **Construct the output grid:** Extract both rows and columns that contain the non-zero values. The order is important: first filter rows, then columns.\n3. **Fix indexing errors:** Revise the extraction functions to build a new, dense, output grid from the extracted rows and columns\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of observations based on the provided results (without needing code execution for these specific examples):\n\n*   **Example 1-4:**  The transformed outputs are empty. This means `get_rows_with_value` or `get_cols_with_value` are not identifying the rows correctly.\n*   **Example 5:** The transformed output includes an extra column. The values are correct, but the extracted column indices are incorrect.\n*   **All Examples:** The color palette is correct (meaning the values themselves are correct). The size is incorrect, and pixel counts are incorrect. This stems from incorrect row/column identification.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The input grids contain a background color (0) and one or more non-zero colors.\n  - observation: |\n      The output grids are constructed from the intersection of rows and columns containing the same non-zero color in each respective input grid.\n  - observation: |\n      The non-zero colors vary across examples (8, 2, 4, 3).\n  - observation: |\n      The output grids contain only non-zero values found in input.\n  - observation: |\n    The example output grids always contain the same color.\n  - action: Identify non-zero colors in the input grid.\n  - action: Identify rows containing the same non-zero color.\n  - action: Identify columns containing the same non-zero color.\n  - action: Construct a sub-grid based on identified indices.\n  - action: The order of operation is first filter for rows, and then filter for columns.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the dominant non-zero color**: Find the most frequent non-zero color that appears in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Rows:** Find the indices of the rows in the input grid that contain only the dominant non-zero color and the background color '0'.\n3.  **Filter Input by Rows:** Create an intermediate grid by extracting only the rows identified in step 2 from the original input grid.\n4.  **Identify Columns:** Find the indices of the columns in the intermediate grid that contain only the dominant non-zero color and the background color '0'.\n5. **Filter Intermediate by Columns:** Create the final output grid by extracting only the columns identified in step 4 from the intermediate grid.\n6.  **Return Output Grid:** Return the filtered grid as the result.\n"
