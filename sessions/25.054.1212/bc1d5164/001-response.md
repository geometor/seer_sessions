Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integer values, which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The input grid appears larger than the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The azure (8) pixels seem to form a connected shape, like a frame.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: [5, 7]
        output: [3, 3]
      elements:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 8]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        8: azure

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A smaller grid is extracted from the larger input grid.

relationships:
  - The azure pixels in the output form a contiguous frame-like structure.
  - The white and azure pixels occupy the same relative spatial postions in the input and output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the bounding box:** Find the outermost azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This defines a rectangular region of interest.
2.  **Extract the core:** Extract the subgrid contained where the azure pixels are.

In simpler terms: The transformation extracts a "zoomed-in" section of the grid. The azure (8) colored frame of the input are used to subset and determine the size of the output.
