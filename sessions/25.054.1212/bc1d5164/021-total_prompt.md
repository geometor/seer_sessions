"""
1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color yellow (value 4) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the bounding box that encompasses all yellow pixels. Or, determine maximum and minimum row/column.
3. **Create** a new output grid with dimensions that, relatively speaking, capture the yellow pixels in a minimal bounding box.
4. **Map** the positions of the identified yellow pixels from the input grid to the output grid. Preserve position *relative to the minimal bounding box.*
5.  **Fill** all other cells in the output grid with the color white (value 0). Essentially, the bounding box created in (2.) is fit into 3x3 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
