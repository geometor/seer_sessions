            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code attempted to extract a subgrid based on a framing color. However, the code incorrectly returns the entire input grid. The core issue is in how `find_frame_color` and `get_bounding_box` are used to define the transformation. It's selecting the frame incorrectly. It isn't identifying the \"inner\" rectangle. The code is getting the dimensions correct and creating a subgrid, but from the wrong indices, making the output identical to the input in all training examples.\n\nThe strategy to fix this involves:\n\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the Frame:** The current `find_frame_color` function only looks for the first non-zero pixel. Instead, it needs to identify the color that forms the *outermost* rectangular frame. This frame might not always start at the top-left corner.\n2.  **Correctly Defining the Inner Region:** Once the framing color is found, the code has to extract not the frame, but the area *inside* the frame. `get_bounding_box` returns the extents of the frame color, which is not what we want in this case.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the frame might be incomplete or touch the edges of the grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example)**\n\nThe transformed outputs match the inputs for all examples. It is getting the bounding box of the outer frame. The color is correct, but it returns the entire grid instead of the inner portion.\n\nHere is a general summary of the examples:\n\n*   All examples have a single-color rectangular frame surrounding an inner region.\n*   The inner region can contain zeros or other colors.\n*   The frame color can vary between examples.\n*   The goal is to extract the inner region, *excluding* the frame.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\ntask: extract_inner_rectangle\nobservations:\n  - type: grid\n    description: Input is a 2D grid of integers representing colors.\n  - type: frame\n    description: A single-color rectangular frame surrounds an inner region.\n  - type: object\n    attribute: inner_region\n    description: The area enclosed by the frame, excluding the frame itself.\n  - type: action\n    description: Extract the inner_region from the input_grid.\n  - type: constraint\n    description: The frame is exactly one pixel wide.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Framing Color:** Find the color of the outermost rectangular frame. Iterate through the grid, the frame color is the color that forms a rectangle around other colors or 0s.\n2. **Find Inner dimensions:** locate the bounding box formed by this color\n3.  **Extract Inner Region:** extract a new grid that starts one row and one column inside the outer frame, and ends one row and one column before the bottom and right edges of the frame.\n4. **Return subgrid:** return the inner grid.\n\n"
