observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
      - dominant_color: most frequent non-zero color

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_grid
      - contains: subset of input_grid colors
      - size: determined by rows and columns containing dominant_color

  - action: find_dominant_color
    description: Identifies the most frequent non-zero color in the input grid.

  - action: select_rows
    description: Selects rows from the input grid that contain the dominant color.
    criteria: Row must contain at least one instance of the dominant color.

  - action: select_columns
    description: Selects columns from the input grid that contain the dominant color.
    criteria: Column must contain at least one instance of the dominant color.
    
  - action: create_output
    description: creates the final output by including cells at the intersection of the selected rows and columns
    constraints:
      - row_index must be in selected_rows
      - col_index must be in selected_cols
