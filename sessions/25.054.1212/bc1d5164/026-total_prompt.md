## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 3 0 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 0 0 3
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC47F93C10>

**output:**
```
0 3 0
3 0 3
0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63370>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of numerical values (representing colors) to another, smaller grid. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and green (3). The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input, retaining only certain elements. The dimensions of the grid change from 5x7 to 3x3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - elements: integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - transform: reduces dimensions, retains specific values

elements:
  - value: 0
    color: white
  - value: 3
    color: green

relationships:
 - input_grid: contains white and green cells
 - output_grid: contains white and green cells from the input, in reduced dimension

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns with '3's:** Examine the input grid and identify the columns that contain the value '3' (green).
2. **Extract those columns:** From the input, extract and only use those columns
3. **Identify rows with '3's:** Examine the modified grid from step 2 and identify rows that contain '3'.
4. **Extract those rows:** From the modified grid, extract and only use those rows
5.  **Construct Output:** The new grid constructed from extracted columns and rows from the input grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation extracts the columns and rows that contain at least one green (3) cell. All other rows or columns are discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
