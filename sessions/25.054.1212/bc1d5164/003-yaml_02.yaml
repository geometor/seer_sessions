facts:
  - observation: Each input grid contains a rectangular frame of a single color.
  - observation: The framing color varies across examples (azure, red, yellow, green).
  - observation: The output grid is a subgrid extracted from the input, bounded by the frame.
  - observation: The frame encloses a rectangular region within the grid.
  - observation: The code must not assume a fixed frame color.
