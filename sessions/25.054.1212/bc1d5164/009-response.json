            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of focusing on red pixels and extracting a 3x3 subgrid was too specific to the first example and doesn't generalize well. The code fails to correctly transform most of the examples because it relies on finding a very specific arrangement (a square) of red pixels, when the colors and the geometry are different in each of the training examples. The core concept of identifying corners of a shape and extracting a region is relevant, but the color and size constraints are incorrect. We need a more flexible approach that considers the common properties across all examples. We should focus on the outermost pixels of *any* color, not just red, that define a bounding rectangle, and use that to determine output size and content.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Generalize Color:** Instead of looking specifically for red (value 2), we should identify the *non-background* color(s) used to define the corners of the rectangle.\n2.  **Dynamic Size:** Instead of always extracting a 3x3 grid, calculate the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the corner pixels and use that to define the output grid's size.\n3. **Refine corner definition:** The initial red pixel search is returning all pixels, not a rectangle, so it is not working correctly. We need to define \"corner\" in a more abstract way, focusing on edge pixels that mark the boundary of a rectangle.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\nI'll summarize important features from each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: Rectangle of azure (8) on white (0) background.\n    *   Corners: Defined by the azure pixels.\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3 square extracted, azure (8) rectangle from the top-left of the shape.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: Rectangle with Red (2) corners\n    *   Corners: Defined by the red pixels.\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3 square extracted, containing mostly red.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: Rectangular outline of yellow (4)\n    *   Corners: Defined by yellow pixels.\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3, contains yellow and a single black pixel.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input shape: Rectangle outline of Yellow (4)\n    *   Corners: Defined by Yellow pixels.\n    * Output shape: 3x3 containing yellow and black\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    * Input shape: Rectangular outline of Green(3)\n    * Corners: Defined by green pixels\n    * Output shape: 3x3 containing green and black\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_shape: rectangle\n    corner_color: azure\n    output_size: 3x3\n    output_content: cropped_input\n  - example: 2\n    input_shape: rectangle_corners\n    corner_color: red\n    output_size: 3x3\n    output_content: cropped_input\n  - example: 3\n    input_shape: rectangle_outline\n    corner_color: yellow\n    output_size: 3x3\n    output_content: cropped_input\n  - example: 4\n    input_shape: rectangle_outline\n    corner_color: yellow\n    output_size: 3x3\n    output_content: cropped_input\n  - example: 5\n    input_shape: rectangle_outline\n    corner_color: green\n    output_size: 3x3\n    output_content: cropped_input\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the outermost bounding pixels:** Find the non-background colored pixels that form the edges of a conceptual rectangle within the input grid. Consider all non-zero colors.\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the rectangle size from these bounding pixels:\n    - The width and height will be based on the number of pixels from leftmost to rightmost and topmost to bottommost.\n    - if width or height < 3, create 3x3 subgrid.\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid of the appropriate size\n    - Copy the content from the top-left corner of the detected rectangle\n\n"
