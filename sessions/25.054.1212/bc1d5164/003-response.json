            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract a subgrid based on an azure (8) frame.  However, the training examples reveal a more general pattern: the transformation extracts a subgrid framed by *any* color, not just azure. The first example happens to use azure, but subsequent examples use red (2), yellow (4), and green (3). The code fails for examples 2-5 because it's specifically looking for color 8, and it returns an empty grid when color 8 isn't present. The strategy must shift from finding a specific color frame to finding *any* single-color frame.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Generalize Frame Detection:** Modify the code to detect the framing color dynamically. Instead of hardcoding color 8, the code should identify which color forms the frame. A frame is defined along rows and columms, forming a rectangle.\n2.  **Handle Missing Frames:** Although there appears to always be frame, the code should handle input cases where the frame is incomplete or entirely absent.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from code execution and visual inspection):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (5,7)\n    *   Framing Color: Azure (8)\n    *   Transformation: Extracts subgrid defined by the azure frame, the bounding box method appears to be returning the entire image.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Returns full grid instead of subgrid.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Framing Color: Red (2)\n    *   Transformation: Should extract subgrid defined by the red frame.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Returns empty grid because it's searching for azure.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Framing Color: Yellow (4)\n    *   Transformation: Should extract subgrid defined by the yellow frame.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Returns empty grid.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Framing Color: Yellow (4)\n    *   Transformation: Should extract subgrid defined by the yellow frame.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Returns empty grid.\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Framing Color: Green (3)\n    *   Transformation: Should extract subgrid defined by the green frame.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. Returns empty grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: Each input grid contains a rectangular frame of a single color.\n  - observation: The framing color varies across examples (azure, red, yellow, green).\n  - observation: The output grid is a subgrid extracted from the input, bounded by the frame.\n  - observation: The frame encloses a rectangular region within the grid.\n  - observation: The code must not assume a fixed frame color.\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - contains: frame\n  - object: frame\n    properties:\n      - type: rectangular border\n      - color: varies\n      - location: outermost contiguous pixels of same color\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - relationship: subgrid of input_grid, bounded by frame\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Framing Color:** Examine the input grid to determine the color of the rectangular frame. The frame is defined as the outermost layer of contiguous pixels of the same color that forms a rectangle.\n2.  **Determine Frame Boundaries:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the framing color. This defines the bounding box of the subgrid.\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid from the input grid using the boundaries determined in step 2.\n4.  **Handle Edge Cases:** if the framing color is missing, return an appropriate value (empty grid or the entire image).\n\nThis natural language program accurately captures the transformation rule observed across all provided training examples. It avoids the initial assumption of a fixed frame color and provides a general solution.\n"
