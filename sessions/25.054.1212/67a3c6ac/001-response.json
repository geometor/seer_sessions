Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation from input to output appears to involve a manipulation of the grid's spatial arrangement, specifically a rotation or reflection, while maintaining the color of each pixel. The dimensions of the grid (4x4) remain constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
