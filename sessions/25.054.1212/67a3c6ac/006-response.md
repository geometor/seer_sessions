"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  The input grid's columns are processed in *reverse* order.
2.  Each column from the input, taken in reverse order, becomes a *row* in the output grid. In other words, the last column of the input grid is used as the first row in the output. The second-to-last input column becomes the second output row, and so on. This is similar to a transpose but with the columns processed in reversed order.
