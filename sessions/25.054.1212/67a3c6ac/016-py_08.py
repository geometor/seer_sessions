"""
The transformation rule involves a more complex geometric manipulation. It is NOT a simple swap across the diagonal.
The input grid appears to be rotated by 180 degrees, but with some additional adjustments.
It's not a pure 180-degree rotation because simple rotation doesn't match the provided outputs.
It might involve rotations or reflections within subgrids or quadrants. Further investigation is needed.
This version implements a 180-degree rotation as a starting point for refinement.
