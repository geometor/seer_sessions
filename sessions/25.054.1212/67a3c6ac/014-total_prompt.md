## Example 3

**input:**
```
1 2 7 1 1 1
2 1 7 7 2 6
2 1 2 6 2 1
1 2 1 7 6 2
2 7 1 2 7 1
2 1 6 2 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC48A63190>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 7 2 1
6 2 7 7 1 2
1 2 6 2 1 2
2 6 7 1 2 1
1 7 2 1 7 2
7 7 2 6 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC48A601C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 6x6 grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The colors are represented by single digits (1-7). It appears that the transformation involves a mirroring or reflection of some kind, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The positions of some colors change, while others remain in the same location. There might be a specific axis or point of reflection that isn't immediately obvious. It's not a rotation. It seems certain cells swap their values.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: grid transformation
  grid_dimensions: [6, 6]
  colors: [1, 2, 6, 7]
  objects:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        color: integer (1-7)
        position: [row, column]
  actions:
    - type: swap
      description: Exchange the color values of two pixels.
      parameters:
        source_pixel: [row, column]
        target_pixel: [row, column]
  relationships:
    - type: reflection
      description:  A non-standard reflection across a diagonal axis or point, defined by the observed swaps.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Swapping Pairs:** The transformation involves specific pairs of pixels swapping their color values. These pairs are not based on simple horizontal or vertical reflection.

2.  **Describe the Swap Rule:** The input grid is transformed to the output grid by swapping cells across the main diagonal but in reverse.
    In more detail:
    - The cell at `input[row][col]` swaps with `output[5-col][5-row]`
    - iterate through all rows from 0 to 5.
    - inside of each row, iterate through all cols from 0 to 5
    - swap each `input[row][col]` with `input[5-col][5-row]`

3.  **Apply the Swap:** For each identified pair, swap the color values between the corresponding pixels in the input grid to produce the output grid. Any pixel not part of a swapping pair retains its original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
