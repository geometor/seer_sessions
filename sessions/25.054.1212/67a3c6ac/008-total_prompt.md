## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 7 7 6 6 6 2
6 7 1 1 7 7 1
7 7 2 1 2 6 6
2 2 7 7 7 2 2
7 2 7 1 2 7 2
6 6 6 2 2 1 1
6 2 6 6 6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7BFC48A601C0>

**output:**
```
2 6 6 6 7 7 7
1 7 7 1 1 7 6
6 6 2 1 2 7 7
2 2 7 7 7 2 2
2 7 2 1 7 2 7
1 1 2 2 6 6 6
6 6 6 6 6 2 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection operation, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The colors themselves remain unchanged; only their positions are altered. The core challenge lies in discerning the precise nature of this positional rearrangement. There might be "objects" within that grid defined by contiguous regions of the same color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        values: [1, 2, 6, 7] #blue, red, magenta, orange
  - type: transformation
    description: positional rearrangement of pixels
    color_invariance: true
  - type: observation
    description: The output appears to be a mirrored version of the input, but the axis of reflection is not immediately obvious. It's likely diagonal.
  - type: potential_operation
    description: "reflection along a diagonal axis"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Grid:** Consider the provided input grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Diagonal Reflection:** The output grid is created from the input grid, by performing a reflection across the main diagonal running from top-left to bottom-right, and swapped. This operation can be achieved as a transposition.
3. **Preserve Colors**: Ensure that during the transposition, the colors of the pixels are maintained. The color at input `(row, col)` should be the same color at output `(col,row)`


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
