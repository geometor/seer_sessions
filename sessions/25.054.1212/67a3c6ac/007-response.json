The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or reflection operation, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The colors themselves remain unchanged; only their positions are altered. The core challenge lies in discerning the precise nature of this positional rearrangement. There might be \"objects\" within that grid defined by contiguous regions of the same color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This operation can be achieved as a transposition.\n3. **Preserve Colors**: Ensure that during the transposition, the colors of the pixels are maintained.
