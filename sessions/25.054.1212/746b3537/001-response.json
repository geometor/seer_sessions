The colors are represented by single digits (1, 2). The dimensions of the grid change from 3x3 to 3x1. The spatial arrangement of the colors is altered in the transformation. The core operation seems to be a reduction in dimensionality, preserving the vertical order but losing the horizontal information.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
