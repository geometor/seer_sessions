            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program correctly identifies the two key objects (azure and yellow) and has the basic idea of expanding the azure object. However, it's misinterpreting *how* the expansion should occur. It's expanding both to the left and right based on the original bounding box, but the expansion in the output is patterned, showing repetitions and a relationship to the azure object's shape and not filling. It's not simply filling the space.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Expansion Logic:** The current logic assumes a simple fill to the edges. We need to recognize the repeating pattern of the azure object during expansion. The expansion to left fills, but the expansion to the right repeats the original azure object.\n2. **Consider row and column offset:** Examine how columns are added, what determines the content of a column.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations and code execution results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Azure object exists, yellow object exists. Azure is not at left or right edge.\n    *   **Expected:** Azure expands to left edge; Azure object repeats to the right.\n    *   **Observed:** Fills to left edge, and almost fills to right, but with an incorrect pattern.\n    *   **Problems:**\n        *   Right side fill is not correct.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Azure object exists, yellow object exists. Azure is not at left or right edge.\n    *   **Expected:** Azure expands to left edge; Azure object repeats to the right.\n    *   **Observed:** Fills to left edge, and fills completely to right, but with an incorrect pattern.\n    *    **Problems:**\n        *   Right side fill is not correct.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Azure object exists, yellow object exists. Azure is not at left or right edge.\n    *   **Expected:** Azure object expands to left, azure object repeats to the right.\n    *   **Observed:**  Fills to left edge, and almost fills to right, but with an incorrect pattern.\n    *   **Problems:**\n        *   Right side fill is not correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - id: 1\n    color: azure (8)\n    type: dynamic\n    actions:\n      - expand_left:\n        - condition: min_col > 0\n        - action: fill with color 8 from col 0 to min_col -1\n      - expand_right:\n        - condition: max_col < max_width - 1\n        - action: repeat object pattern from min_col to max_col to fill columns, starting from max_col+1 to max_width -1\n\n  - id: 2\n    color: yellow (4)\n    type: static\n    actions: []\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all pixels colored azure (8) and group them as a single \"azure object\". Locate all pixels colored yellow (4) and group them as a single \"yellow object\".\n\n2.  **Yellow Object:** The yellow object remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Azure Object Transformation:**\n    *   Determine the bounding box of the azure object (minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, maximum column).\n    *   **Expand Left:** If the azure object's minimum column is greater than 0, fill the area from column 0 up to (but not including) the azure object's minimum column with the color azure (8). All rows that contain part of the object will be expanded.\n    *   **Expand Right:** If the azure object's maximum column is less than the input grid's width minus 1, copy each column of the azure object, starting at the min_col. Then paste it to the grid to the right of max\\_col, one column at a time, filling each column until the end of the grid.\n\n"
