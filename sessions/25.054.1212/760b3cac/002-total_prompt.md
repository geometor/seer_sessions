## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7BFC4890B040>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, each representing a color. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).  The transformation appears to modify the azure (8) elements, but not the yellow (4) elements. The transformation of the azure elements is not a simple global color swap, so the position must matter. There's some form of spatial relationship between the azure pixels in the input and output. The yellow region is invariant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 9] # 6 rows, 9 columns
      elements:  # Represents cell values and their colors
        0: white
        4: yellow
        8: azure
  - type: object_group
    properties:
      color: azure
      initial_positions: [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5]]
      transformed_positions: [[0, 0], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1,4], [1,5], [2,0], [2, 5]]
  - type: object_group
    properties:
      color: yellow
      positions: [[3, 3], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]  # Remains unchanged
      
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description:  Azure (8) pixels are moved/added while respecting some relative positions.
    target: object_group (azure)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  The position of the azure pixels is changed. The position of the yellow pixels is invariant.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Invariant Region:** Locate the connected region of yellow (4) pixels. This region remains unchanged in the output.
2.  **Analyze Azure Pixels:** Examine the azure (8) pixels.
    -   The top left corner gets a value of azure.
    -   The first row has azure in columns 0, 2, and 3.
    -   If row 0, column 3 is azure, then row 1 columns 0 and 1 are azure.
    -   If row 0, column 5 is azure, then row 1, columns 4 and 5 are azure.
    -    If row 2 column 5 is azure, then row 2 column 0 is azure.
3.  **Preserve Yellow:** Copy the yellow (4) region directly to the output grid.
4.  **Fill Remainder**: Any cell not filled in step 2 or 3 is white (0).

In summary: It appears that azure pixels are placed at specific positions and also moved to the left boundary. The connected yellow component is an invariant region. The transformation seems to 'consolidate' some of the azure pixels to the left, and fills a few specified cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
