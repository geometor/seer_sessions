The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).  The transformation appears to modify the azure (8) elements, but not the yellow (4) elements. The transformation of the azure elements is not a simple global color swap, so the position must matter. There's some form of spatial relationship between the azure pixels in the input and output. The yellow region is invariant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This region remains unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Analyze Azure Pixels:** Examine the azure (8) pixels.\n    -   The top left corner gets a value of azure.\n    -   The first row has azure in columns 0, 2, and 3.\n    -   If row 0, column 3 is azure, then row 1 columns 0 and 1 are azure.\n    -   If row 0, column 5 is azure, then row 1, columns 4 and 5 are azure.\n    -    If row 2 column 5 is azure, then row 2 column 0 is azure.\n3.  **Preserve Yellow:** Copy the yellow (4) region directly to the output grid.\n4.  **Fill Remainder**: Any cell not filled in step 2 or 3 is white (0).\n\nIn summary: It appears that azure pixels are placed at specific positions and also moved to the left boundary. The connected yellow component is an invariant region. The transformation seems to 'consolidate' some of the azure pixels to the left, and fills a few specified cells.\n"
