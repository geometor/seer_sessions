Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program was too simplistic. It assumed that *all* azure regions would expand horizontally to fill *all* available white space in their respective rows. The test results clearly show this isn't the case. The expansion seems to be more localized and constrained, and there is an asymmetry in how the expansion occurs. It is also evident that expansion only happens in the rows that originally contains azure pixels. The yellow pixels are indeed unchanged.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **More Precise Region Identification:** Instead of simply finding all azure pixels, we need to identify *contiguous* azure regions. The current code doesn't properly treat sequences of azure pixels as single units to expand.

2.  **Constrained Expansion:** The expansion is not simply filling the whole row. The algorithm should track each connected azure region and expand them individually and only as far as empty space is available.

3.  **Row Constraint**: Expansion should be constrained to only the original rows containing azure.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting the issues:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Issue:** The azure expands across the entire top three rows, even those without an original azure pixel.
    *   **Metrics:** 11 pixels different.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Issue:** Similar to Example 1, the azure expansion is too broad, filling the top three rows entirely instead of to the available blank space.
    *   **Metrics:** 17 pixels different.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    **Issue:** Again, expansion is too aggressive.
    *   **Metrics:** 16 pixels different.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: azure_regions
    type: connected_component
    color: azure
    behavior: expand_horizontally_limited
    constraints:
      - row_limited #expansion is limited within the original rows
      - blocked_by_other_colors
      - expands_to_white_only
  - object: yellow_regions
    type: connected_component
    color: yellow
    behavior: static
    constraints: []
  - grid:
      rows: 6
      cols: 9

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of one or more azure pixels directly adjacent horizontally or vertically.

2. **Constrained Horizontal Expansion for each region**:
   For each continuous block of azure pixels
        a. Expand the azure region to the left, one pixel at a time, replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8), until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered.
       b. Expand the azure region to the right, one pixel at a time, replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8) until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered.

3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** Do not modify any pixels that are not part of the identified azure regions. Specifically, the yellow regions remain unchanged.

4. **Row Limited Expansion:** Only rows containing original azure pixels will contain azure pixels in the output.
