## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7BFC4423F010>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors present are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). The transformation appears to involve a change in the configuration of the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. Specifically, some azure pixels are duplicated, shifting the existing ones.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_cluster_1
    type: pixel_cluster
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: [(0,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3)]
    final_position:  [(0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3)]
  - id: yellow_cluster_1
    type: pixel_cluster
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
    final_position: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
  - id: background
    type: pixel_cluster
    color: white (0)
    initial_position: "all other cells"
    final_position: "all other cells"

actions:
  - type: duplication_and_shift
    object: azure_cluster_1
    details: >
       The azure cluster is modified. The pixel at (0,3) moves two cells to the left and becomes (0,2).
       The original pixels at (1,4) and (1,5) remain.
       A new group of Azure colored pixels are added to the left of the original (1,4) and (1,5). Two azure colored pixels are added at (1,0) and (1,1).
       The original pixel at (2,3) becomes (2,2), moving one position to the left. The output grid now contains an additional 8 colored pixel at (2,3).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The yellow cluster remains spatially constant. The azure cluster expands and shifts its location to the left.
  - type: unchanged
    description: background remains the same

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous clusters of azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Yellow Cluster:** The yellow (4) cluster remains unchanged in the output grid. Copy it directly.
3.  **Azure Cluster Transformation:**
    *   The top azure pixel located at (0,3) is duplicated and shifted two spaces to the left. (0,2)
    *   Two azure pixels in the second row (1,4) and (1,5) remain the same, however two more are inserted to their left (1,0), (1,1)
    *  The azure pixel at (2,3) is duplicated, the original shifting one space to the left (2,2) and the added pixel remains at (2,3).
4.  **Background:** All other pixels (white/0) remain unchanged.

In short.
The Yellow object remains the same.
The Azure object is copied and expanded to the left.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
