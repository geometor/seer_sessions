Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Azure Regions: Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of one or more azure pixels directly adjacent horizontally or vertically.

2. Constrained Horizontal Expansion for each region:
   For each continuous block of azure pixels
        a. Expand the azure region to the left, one pixel at a time, replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8), until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered.
       b. Expand the azure region to the right, one pixel at a time, replacing white (0) pixels with azure (8), until a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered.

3. Preserve Other Colors: Do not modify any pixels that are not part of the identified azure regions. Specifically, the yellow regions remain unchanged.

4. Row Limited Expansion: Only rows containing original azure pixels will contain azure pixels in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
