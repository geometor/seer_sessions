## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7BFC47FB9600>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0 8
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved appear to be azure (8), yellow (4), and white (0). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6x9). The azure and yellow regions seem to maintain their overall shape but undergo some form of modification. Specifically, the azure region in the top part of the grid appears to be the focus of the transformation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_region_1
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular
      location: top_center
    actions:
      - expand_horizontally:
          details: "Azure pixels expand to fill available white space to their left and/or right based, maintaining vertical position within their starting row."
  - object: yellow_region_1
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: irregular
      location: center
    actions: []
  - object: white_region
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      shape: background
    actions:
      - replaced:
         details: "White pixels adjacent to expanding azure are replaced"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the azure region** in the top half of the grid.
2.  **For each row** within the azure region:
    *   Locate the leftmost and rightmost azure pixels.
    *   Expand the azure color horizontally to fill any white (0) pixels to the *left* until another non-white pixel is hit or the edge of the grid.
    *   Expand the azure color horizontally to fill and white (0) pixels to the *right* until another non-white pixel is hit or the edge of the grid.
3.  **The yellow region remains unchanged.**
4. **All the other white regions remain unchanged.**

Essentially, the azure region expands horizontally within its original rows, filling available white space, but is blocked by other colored blocks. The yellow region does not change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
