            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided examples, analysis, and an updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was overly specific, focusing on a single pixel change observed in the first example. It failed to generalize to other examples. The core issue is that the transformation isn't about a single, hardcoded pixel change, but a more general rearrangement/copying of pixel values based on specific rules related to rows and positions. We need to shift from hardcoded coordinate changes to pattern recognition and relative positioning. It will be important to account for all training examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs to identify common patterns and relationships.\n2.  **Discard Specificity:** Abandon the initial rule focusing on single pixels.\n3.  **Identify General Rules:** Develop rules based on relative positions, row operations, and possibly conditional pixel changes based on values.\n4. **Prioritize Row Operations**: The results so far imply row based transformations or pixel movements within and across rows.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using manual inspection and incorporating results):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid; The `5` at (1,0) moved to (0,2), the `5` at (2,0) moved to (0,1). The bottom row is rotated to the left.\n    *   Result: Incorrect. The code only changes (1,0) to `5`, the value of (0,0).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid. The `5` at (2,0) and (2,1) is replaced by the value of (1,0) and (1,1), and the `5` at (1,2) is replaced by the `5` at (2,0).\n    *   Result: Incorrect.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid. The `5` at (1,0) changed into `9`, the value of(0,0).\n    *   Result: Correct. This example matches by chance with the initial incorrect rule.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid, first row is rotated by 1 to the left, and the first and last element of the last two rows are switched.\n    *   Result: Incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformations: |\n        Elements of the last row shifted within the row.\n        The '5's from the first column are used in the first row.\n\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformations: |\n        The bottom left `5`s are replaced with the values above them, and the last element of the middle row is replaced by a `5` from the row below.\n\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformations: |\n        The '5' at (1,0) is replaced by '9' at (0,0)\n\n  - example_4:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      transformations: |\n        First row rotates by 1 to the left, last two row's first and last elements are switched.\n\n  - general:\n      grid_size: constant\n      colors: preserved, some relocated\n      rows: Elements in rows change based on relative positioning.\n      columns: No specific column operation is consistently applied, focus on row transformations\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **First Row:** The first row seems independent in examples 3 and 4.\n2.  **Other Rows:** For the second and third rows:\n    * The first element of the second row becomes the first element of the first row.\n    * Other elements move in complex patterns.\n3. Look at each row.\n    * The first row is rotated left 1.\n    * the other two rows swap their first and last values.\n\n```\nThe output grid is the same size as the input grid (3x3).\nThe first row of the output grid is obtained by rotating the first row of input to the left by 1 position.\nThe second and third rows of the output grid are derived by swapping the first and last element.\n\n```\n"
