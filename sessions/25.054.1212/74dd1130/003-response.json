            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the 90-degree clockwise rotation hypothesis and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid's dimensions are consistent with a rotation (the number of rows and columns are swapped), the pixel arrangements within the grid don't match a simple rotation. The consistent `pixels_off` count across multiple examples suggests a systematic error, not random misplacement. The \"match: False\" in all the above training examples indicates the hypothesis is flawed. The \"pixels_off\" metrics indicate the number of pixels in the transformed output that do not match the expected output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully compare the input and expected output of *all* provided examples. Look for patterns beyond simple rotation. Consider mirroring, reflection, or combinations of operations.\n2.  **Focus on Specific Pixels:** Trace the path of individual pixels from input to expected output. Note their original and final positions and colors.\n3.  **Consider Object-Based Transformations:** Since ARC problems often involve object manipulation, think about whether parts of the grid are being treated as distinct objects.\n4.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate a new, more complex hypothesis that explains *all* the training examples.\n5.  **Document every observation** in a YAML block\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid: |\n      2 2 1\n      1 5 1\n      5 2 2\n    expected_output: |\n      2 1 5\n      2 5 2\n      1 1 2\n    observations:\n      - object: input_grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [3, 3]\n          colors: [1, 2, 5]\n        transformations:\n          - type: transpose and mirror\n            details: columns become rows, and each new row order is reversed\n      - object: column_1\n        properties:\n            colors: [2,1,5]\n            new_location: row_1 reverse\n            \n      - object: column_2\n        properties:\n            colors: [2,5,2]\n            new_location: row_2 reverse\n\n      - object: column_3\n        properties:\n            colors: [1,1,2]\n            new_location: row_3 reverse\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid: |\n      2 2 5\n      6 2 2\n      5 5 5\n    expected_output: |\n      2 6 5\n      2 2 5\n      5 2 5\n    observations:\n      - object: input_grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [3, 3]\n          colors: [2, 5, 6]\n        transformations:\n          - type: transpose and mirror\n            details: columns become rows, and each new row order is reversed\n      - object: column_1\n        properties:\n          colors: [2,6,5]\n          new_location: row_1 reverse\n\n      - object: column_2\n        properties:\n          colors: [2,2,5]\n          new_location: row_2 reverse\n            \n      - object: column_3\n        properties:\n          colors: [5,2,5]\n          new_location: row_3 reverse\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_grid: |\n      9 9 5\n      5 5 8\n      5 8 9\n    expected_output: |\n      9 5 5\n      9 5 8\n      5 8 9\n    observations:\n      - object: input_grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [3, 3]\n          colors: [5, 8, 9]\n        transformations:\n          - type: transpose and mirror\n            details: columns become rows, and each new row order is reversed\n      - object: column_1\n        properties:\n            colors: [9,5,5]\n            new_location: row_1 reverse\n\n      - object: column_2\n        properties:\n          colors: [9,5,8]\n          new_location: row_2 reverse\n            \n      - object: column_3\n        properties:\n          colors: [5,8,9]\n          new_location: row_3 reverse\n\n  - example_id: 4\n    input_grid: |\n      2 6 6\n      2 1 1\n      2 6 2\n    expected_output: |\n      2 2 2\n      6 1 6\n      6 1 2\n    observations:\n      - object: input_grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [3, 3]\n          colors: [1, 2, 6]\n        transformations:\n          - type: transpose and mirror\n            details: columns become rows, and each new row order is reversed\n      - object: column_1\n        properties:\n          colors: [2,2,2]\n          new_location: row_1 reverse\n            \n      - object: column_2\n        properties:\n          colors: [6,1,6]\n          new_location: row_2 reverse\n            \n      - object: column_3\n        properties:\n          colors: [6,1,2]\n          new_location: row_3 reverse\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Treat the input grid as a collection of columns.** Each column is an object.\n2.  **Transform columns into rows.** The first column of the input becomes the first row of the output, the second column becomes the second row, and so on.\n3.  **Reverse the order of elements within each new row.** The elements that were at the bottom of a column are now at the beginning of the corresponding row. This can be thought of \"reflecting\" or \"mirroring\" each row.\n\nIn shorter terms, the transformation is a *transposition of the grid (columns become rows) followed by a horizontal reflection (reversal) of each newly formed row.*\n"
