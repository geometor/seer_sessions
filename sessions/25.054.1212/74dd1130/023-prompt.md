Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify Stable Elements:**  Pixels that are not red (2) or magenta (6) remain unchanged in their original positions. This includes blue (1) pixels.

2.  **Pixel Replacement:**
    - Examine each row of the input grid.
    - Identify the position of red(2) pixels, if any
    - Identify the position of magenta(6) pixels, if any
    - Determine pixels on the same row in the output grid.
    - Replace red and magenta pixels with values using the color of other pixels in the same row from input to output.

3.  **Preservation of Colors:** The set of colors present in each row of the input grid is the same as the set of colors present in the corresponding row of the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
