## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 2 5
6 2 2
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A200>

**output:**
```
2 6 5
2 2 5
5 2 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93D30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grids contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a change in the position of some, but not all, of the digits/colors. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color: mapped from value
          position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: transpose
    description: Swaps elements across the main diagonal, specifically focused on the top row and first column, leaving the rest of the structure unchanged.
relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid (transformed by transposition)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** We have a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Focus**: Concentrate on the first row and first column specifically.
3. **Action:** The values in cells at positions (0,1) and (1,0) in input grid are swapped and moved to output grid in the corresponding mirrored positions. In this example, the values in positions (0,1) and (1,0) are transposed. Specifically, value in position (0,1) with value `2` in the input is moved to (1,0) in the output and value `6` at postion (1,0) is moved to (0,1) in the output.
4.  **Preserve**: All other cells retain their original values and positions, directly copied from the input grid to the corresponding location in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
