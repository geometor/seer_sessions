            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to improve the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were too narrowly focused on the first example. It correctly identified the \"blue pixel stability\" rule but failed to generalize the \"swapping\" rule correctly. The swapping logic is flawed and doesn't account for different scenarios of magenta and red pixel positions. The results show consistent mismatches across multiple examples, indicating a need for a more robust rule description. The core problem is that the swapping logic in the code does not follow a consistent left/right rule. Instead it seems some pixels are swapped and some are just changed with out swapping.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples, not just the first one.  Pay close attention to the relative positions of the magenta (6) and red (2) pixels in *both* the input and output grids of each example.\n2.  **Identify the Correct Swapping Rule:** Determine the *precise* rule governing the change in position of the magenta and red pixels. The current \"horizontal swap\" idea is close, but the implementation is incorrect. It's not a simple swap, but is related to where red/magenta pixels are on the rows.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:**  Rewrite the natural language program to accurately and unambiguously describe the observed transformation, covering all cases.\n4.  **Abstract the transformation.** The existing program attempts to do too much in the horizontal swap section.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations that will help refine the rule:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `2 1 1`, `1 5 1`, `5 2 2`\n    *   Expected: `2 1 5`, `2 5 2`, `1 1 2`\n    *   Observed: `2 1 1`, `1 5 1`, `5 2 2`\n    *   **Key Observation:** The first row changes the last '1' to '5', the second row changes the first '1' to a '2'.\n        The last row changes from `5 2 2` to `1 1 2`.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `2 6 5`, `6 2 2`, `5 5 5`\n    *   Expected: `2 6 5`, `2 2 5`, `5 2 5`\n    *   Observed: `2 6 6`, `6 2 2`, `5 5 5`\n    *   **Key Observation:** Row 1 is unchanged, row 2: '6' replaced by a '2' and the final '2' by '5'. Row 3: first 5 replaced by 2.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `9 5 5`, `5 5 8`, `5 8 9`\n    *   Expected: `9 5 5`, `9 5 8`, `5 8 9`\n    *   Observed: `9 5 5`, `5 5 8`, `5 8 9`\n    *   **Key Observation:** Row 2: first '5' replaced by '9'.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `2 2 6`, `2 1 1`, `2 6 2`\n    *   Expected: `2 2 2`, `6 1 6`, `6 1 2`\n    *   Observed: `2 2 6`, `2 1 1`, `2 6 6`\n    *   **Key Observation:** Row 1: final '6' changed to '2'. Row 2: first '2' changed to '6' and final '1' also changed to '6'. Row 3: first '2' changed to '6'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: Blue pixels remain in the same position.\n    type: object_stability\n    object: blue pixel\n    property: position\n    action: none\n\n  - description: Other colors besides blue, red, and magenta stay the same.\n    type: object_stability\n    object: other color pixel\n    property: position\n    action: none\n\n  - description: Red pixels are replaced with other colors or stay the same.\n    type: object_transformation\n    object: red pixel\n    property: value\n    action: change\n\n  - description: Magenta pixels are replaced with other colors or stay the same.\n    type: object_transformation\n    object: magenta pixel\n    property: value\n    action: change\n\n  - description: There appears to be a replacement of pixels.\n    type: action\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Stable Elements:**  Pixels that are not red (2) or magenta (6) remain unchanged in their original positions. This includes blue (1) pixels.\n\n2. **Pixel Replacement:**\n   - Examine each row of the input grid.\n   - Identify the position of red(2) pixels, if any\n   - Identify the position of magenta(6) pixels, if any\n   - Determine pixels on the same row in the output grid.\n   - Replace red and magenta pixels with values using the color of other pixels in the same row from input to output.\n\n3.  **Preservation of Colors:** The set of colors present in each row of the input grid is the same as the set of colors present in the corresponding row of the output grid.\n\n"
