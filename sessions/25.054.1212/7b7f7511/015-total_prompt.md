Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program takes the input grid and crops it to produce the output grid. The output grid consists of the top half of the input grid. Specifically, we take all columns, and the rows from the start index (0) up to, but not including, the row at the middle of the height of the input (input rows / 2).

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_rows = len(input_grid)
    input_cols = len(input_grid[0])
    output_rows = input_rows // 2
    output_cols = input_cols
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels 
    for i in range(output_rows):

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

Input:
```

1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3
3 3 1 1 3 3 1 1
2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1 1 3 2
1 1 3 3

Transformed Output:
```
1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
