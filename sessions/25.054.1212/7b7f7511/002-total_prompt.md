## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2
1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3
3 3 1 1 3 3 1 1
2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x256 at 0x7BFC48908FA0>

**output:**
```
1 1 3 2
1 1 3 3
3 3 1 1
2 3 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC48909C90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or cropping operation. The colors present are blue (1), green (3), and red (2). The output grid retains the spatial arrangement of colors from the input, but with reduced dimensions. The core operation seems to be a reduction of the width, and perhaps cropping to remove some columns.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of colored pixels
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: green
        value: 3
      - color: red
        value: 2
  - operation: reduction
    description: Input grid is reduced in size to form the output grid.
  - spatial_relationship: preserved
    description: The relative positions of colors are maintained.
  - input_dimensions:
      width: 8
      height: 4
  - output_dimensions:
      width: 4
      height: 4
  - dimension_change:
    description: width is halved, height remains same.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to reduce the width of the input grid by half, while keeping the height same. Take the original left most four columns and discard the right four columns. The output grid is formed by retaining the top-left quadrant (4x4) of the original input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
