## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7BFC4757BA90>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47579F90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2). The output grid appears to be a simplified or abstracted representation of the input grid, focusing on a specific feature. The red pixel (2) in the center of the output might represent a specific characteristic or pattern in the input. The position (center) of the red pixel, and its relation with the surrounding gray column in input may be a key.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x7
    elements: [0, 1, 5]
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2]

properties:
  - object: input_grid
    property: has_vertical_line
    value: True
    color: 5
    location: center_column
  - object: output_grid
    property: center_pixel_color
    value: 2

actions:
  - type: find_pattern
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: "Locates a specific feature within the input grid and represents it in the output grid"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    object1: input_grid
    object2: output_grid
    description: "The output grid's dimensions are smaller than the input, suggesting a focused extraction or abstraction"
  - type: color_change
    object1: input_grid
    object2: output_grid.center
    from: 5
    to: 2
    description: color change represents central object

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central vertical line/column:** Examine the input grid and locate the vertical column of pixels that divides the grid into two equal horizontal halves. In this example it made of the gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Create Output grid:** create a new 3 x 3 grid
3. **Create Centered Object:** Paint the center pixel of a 3x3 output grid red (2).
4. **Background.** Fill the rest of the output with white (0).

In essence, the transformation isolates the central vertical dividing line and represents its presence with a red pixel in the center of a smaller, otherwise blank, output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
