Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid independently.
2.  **Check for Grey:** For each row, check if it contains the value 5 (grey).
3.  **Transform Row (if grey exists):** If the row contains a 5, create a new row for the output grid:
    *   Iterate through the input row.
    *   If a value in that row is 5 (grey), place a 2 (red) in the corresponding position of the output row.
    *   For all other values in the input row, place a 0 (white) in the corresponding position of the output row.
4.  **Output Grid:** Assemble the transformed rows into a 3x3 output grid. If there are fewer than three rows to transform, fill in default rows of all 0.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the grey-to-red transformation, it failed to account for the positioning of the red pixels within the output grid, it did not accurately reproduce the red positions from the original grey position. The code limited output to at most 3 columns.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Observation:** Analyze *all* training examples to pinpoint the *exact* relationship between the grey pixels in the input and the red pixels in the output. The key is understanding how the column position is determined.
2.  **Improve Position Logic:** The current code simply replaces grey with red in the same column. This is incorrect. We need a mechanism to identify the correct column index, limiting to the first 3 columns.
3.  **Re-evaluate Row Selection:** Confirm that the row selection (taking only rows with grey) is accurate across all examples.
4.  **Output Size:** Enforce a consistent 3x3 output, padding with zeros if necessary.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution for reporting - not shown):**

To get accurate results, I would execute the provided `transform` function against each input, compare it with the expected output, and calculate pixel-level differences. However, I will summarize conceptually what those reports would show, based on the images and data provided:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Pixel Matches: Many mismatches, primarily because of a bug with processing columns beyond the first three.
    *   Observation: The red pixel (2) in the expected output corresponds to the second gray pixel (5) in the input (second row, fourth column).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3,3)
    *   Pixel Matches: Multiple mismatches.
    *    Observation: The first red pixel (2) corresponds to the first gray (5) - first row, fourth column.  The second red (2) is the second gray - second row, fourth column. The third red (2) is third gray - third row, fourth column.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Transformed Output Shape: (3,3)
    *   Pixel Matches:  Multiple mismatches.
    *   Observation: Same pattern as Example 2 - the red position in the output (row, col) corresponds to the Nth grey pixel in the input.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "010"
  - input_objects:
      - description: Input grid of varying size, containing pixels of different colors.
        properties:
          - colors: [0, 1, 5]  # white, blue, grey
          - shape: Variable, up to 30x30
  - output_objects:
      - description: Output grid of fixed size (3x3), containing only white and red pixels.
        properties:
          - colors: [0, 2]  # white, red
          - shape: (3, 3)
  - transformations:
      - description: Grey pixels in the input are transformed to red pixels in the output; all others are changed to white.
        details: >
          The position of a red pixel in the output corresponds to the
          position of the Nth grey pixel in the input, considering only the
          first three grey pixels found, row by row. If a row contains gray,
          a red pixel is placed at column index corresponding to the order
          (first, second, third, from the left) that the grey pixel appeared
          within that input.
          All other pixels in output are white. The output size is always 3x3.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).
2.  **Grey Pixel Counter:** Initialize a counter `grey_count` to 0.
3.  **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  **Grey Detection:** Within each row, iterate through the pixels.
    a. If the current input pixel is grey (5):
    i. Increment `grey_count`.
    ii. If `grey_count` is less than or equal to 3: Determine the output row index (from 0 to 2, it is just the order of rows that contained grey). Place a red pixel (2) in the output grid at the position `[row_index][grey_count - 1]`.
5. Stop processing after three grey pixels have been found, either within the row or across multiple rows.
6.  **Output:** Return the 3x3 output grid.

Essentially the refined logic is to iterate through the input grid row-by-row. Every time a grey pixel is seen, a red pixel is placed in the next available slot (col) of the output. The order of grey pixels determine the red pixel columns in the output. The row order is simply the order of the rows that contained grey.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
