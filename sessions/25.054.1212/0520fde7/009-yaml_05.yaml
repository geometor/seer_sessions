facts:
  - task: "Map values in the row containing grey (5) to a 3x3 output grid."
  - input_objects:
    - description: "Input grid with varying dimensions, containing digits 0-9."
      properties:
        - colors: "Represents colors based on digit values (0-9)."
        - key_color: "Grey (5) acts as a marker."
  - output_objects:
    - description: "A 3x3 output grid."
      properties:
        - size: "Always 3x3."
        - colors: "Contains only white (0) and red (2)."
  - transformations:
    - description: "Row-wise mapping based on the input."
      rules:
        - "If a row contains the number 5, transform and include in the output"
        - "If a row in input has 5, set to 2 in output at the same x coordinate"
        - "All other input pixels on that row transform to 0"
  - constraints:
      - "output is always 3x3"
      - "only map rows with a 5"
