Specifically, blue (1) in the input seems to be related to white(0) in the output and grey (5) seems to correspond to red (2) in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each value extracted in step 2:\n\n    *   If the value is 1 (blue), place a 0 (white) in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n    *   If the value is 5 (grey), place a 2 (red) in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n    * If the value is 0, leave the default 0.\n4. Output the new 3x3 grid\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the column with 5s, maps 1s to 0s, 5s to 2s, and constructs smaller 3x3 output.\n"
