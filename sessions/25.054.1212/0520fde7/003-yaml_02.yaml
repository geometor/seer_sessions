      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        properties:
          - attribute: central_column
            description: The middle column of the grid.
            value: Varies per example.
      - name: gray_pixels
        type: pixels
        properties:
          - attribute: color
            value: gray (5)
          - attribute: location
            description: Indices within the central column.
            value: Varies, but always in central column.
      - name: output_grid
        type: grid
        size: 3x3
        properties:
          - attribute: content
            description: Represents the presence of gray pixels in the input's central column using red pixels. All other pixels are white
            value: dynamic
      - name: red_pixels
        type: pixels
        properties:
          - attribute: color
            value: red (2)
          - attribute: location
            description:  Row indices in the output grid corresponding to the row indices of gray pixels in the input grid's central column. Columns are not 1:1, but a mapping to a single, centered, column.
            value: Varies per example
    actions:
      - description: Identify the central column of the input grid.
      - description: Find the indices of gray (5) pixels within the central column.
      - description: Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white pixels (0).
      - description: For each gray pixel found in the input's central column, set the corresponding row index in the output grid's central column to red (2), all other output is white (0)
