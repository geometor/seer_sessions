## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
0 0 1 5 1 1 1
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7BFC475A1A80>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A3880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 3x7 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The output is a 3x3 grid, also of single-digit integers.
*   There's a noticeable reduction in size from input to output.
*   Specific colors in the input seem to correspond to specific colors in the output. Specifically, blue (1) in the input seems to be related to white(0) in the output and grey (5) seems to correspond to red (2) in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    dimensions: 3x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - observation: reduction in grid size
    from: input
    to: output
  - observation: color correspondence
    input_color: 1 (blue)
    output_color: 0 (white)
  - observation: color correspondence
    input_color: 5 (grey)
    output_color: 2 (red)
  - observation: all other colors in the input are 0, and do not appear to contribute the non-zero values in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus Column:** Identify the column in the input grid that contains the value 5 (grey).
2.  **Extraction:** Extract the values from this grey column.
3. **Color Mapping:** Create a new 3x3 grid. For each value extracted in step 2:

    *   If the value is 1 (blue), place a 0 (white) in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    *   If the value is 5 (grey), place a 2 (red) in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    * If the value is 0, leave the default 0.
4. Output the new 3x3 grid

Essentially, the transformation extracts the column with 5s, maps 1s to 0s, 5s to 2s, and constructs smaller 3x3 output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
