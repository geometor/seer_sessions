Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies the central vertical line in the input grid and represents it with a red pixel in the center of a 3x3 output grid, which is otherwise filled with white pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def get_central_column(grid):
    """
    Returns index of the central column of a 2D numpy array.
    """
    _, num_cols = grid.shape
    central_col_index = num_cols // 2
    return central_col_index

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid into output representation.
    """
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # find input central column
    #central_column_index = get_central_column(input_grid)
    #central_column = input_grid[:, central_column_index]
    
    # change output pixels 
    output_grid[1, 1] = 2  # Set the center pixel to red (2)

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
