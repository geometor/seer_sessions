## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC47F93880>

**output:**
```
0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC4423CA60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain only two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The input grid appears to have a sparse distribution of blue pixels, while the output grid has a more regular, checkerboard-like pattern of blue and white pixels. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid in both dimensions. There is no readily-apparent spatial correspondence (like a direct sub-sampling or windowing) between the positions of the blue pixels in the input and output. The transformation likely involves some form of summarization or pattern extraction from the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements: [0, 1]  # white, blue
    properties:
      - sparse_blue: True

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements: [0, 1] # white, blue
    properties:
      - checkerboard_pattern: True

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    type: summarization/pattern_extraction #Hypothesized, not definitive

relationships:
  - input_grid:larger_than:output_grid
  - input_grid:less_structured_than:output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide** the input grid into 2x2 blocks of pixels.
2.  **Evaluate** each 2x2 block: if the block contains *any* blue (1) pixels, the corresponding output pixel is blue (1).
3.  If a 2x2 block in the input is completely all white (0) pixels, the corresponding output pixel is white(0).
4.  **Construct** output grid. The output grid's dimensions will be input_height/2 x input_width/2, and will contain these calculated blue or white pixels.

Essentially, each 2x2 block in the input grid gets reduced to a single pixel in the output grid, with the presence of any blue within a block dictating the resulting output pixel's color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
