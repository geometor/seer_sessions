Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer, corresponding to a specific color (as defined in the system prompt's color map). The transformation seems to involve propagating or filling certain colors based on the initial configuration. Specifically, it looks like the magenta (6) color in the top right corner is expanding or being used to fill other cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
