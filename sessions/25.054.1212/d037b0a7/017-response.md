Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the duplication of yellow and red pixels downwards, it failed to account for:

1.  **Chaining:** The duplication should continue. If a pixel is duplicated, the newly created pixel should also be duplicated downwards, and so on, until the bottom of the grid is reached.
2.  **Simultaneous Propagation**: The propogation of the red and yellow pixels are linked to each other. The nature of this linkage isn't completely clear from the examples.

The strategy to resolve the errors will involve these main parts:

1. **Clarify Chaining**: Revise the natural language program to capture the chained downward duplication. This will likely transform the Python code from a single duplication step to a loop or recursive call.
2. **Determine linkage between propagation**: Identify the row and column of each instance, and use this insight to form the new natural language program.
3. **Metrics Gathering**: Collect the specific data for this insight, such as the row and column for the red and yellow pixel in each image.

**Metrics Gathering**

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def find_pixel(grid, color_value):
    """Finds the coordinates of a pixel with a specific color value."""
    coords = []
    for r_idx, row in enumerate(grid):
        for c_idx, pixel in enumerate(row):
            if pixel == color_value:
                coords.append((r_idx, c_idx))
    return coords

def analyze_examples(examples):
    results = {}
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

        results[f'example_{i+1}'] = {
            'input_yellow': find_pixel(input_grid, 4),
            'input_red': find_pixel(input_grid, 2),
            'output_yellow': find_pixel(output_grid, 4),
            'output_red': find_pixel(output_grid, 2),
        }
    return results

# example data structure
examples = [
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]],
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]],
    },
     {
        "input": [[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]],
    },
]

analysis = analyze_examples(examples)
print(analysis)


```
