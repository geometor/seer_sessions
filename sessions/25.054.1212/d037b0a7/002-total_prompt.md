## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A3B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890B430>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer, corresponding to a specific color (as defined in the system prompt's color map). The transformation seems to involve propagating or filling certain colors based on the initial configuration. Specifically, it looks like the magenta (6) color in the top right corner is expanding or being used to fill other cells.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    representation: integers (0-9)
  - object: pixel_colors
    values:
      0: white
      3: green
      4: yellow
      6: magenta
  - observation:
      input: magenta (6) is only in the top-right corner
      output: magenta (6) occupies the entire rightmost column.
  - observation:
      input: yellow (4) is in the center, and green (3) is in the bottom-left corner
      output: yellow (4) and green (3) maintain relative positions.
  - relationship: values_propagate
    agent: magenta (6)
    target: rightmost column
  - action: fill
    agent: magenta (6)
    location: rightmost_column

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the rightmost column:** Locate the column of pixels on the far right side of the grid.
2.  **Propagate Magenta:** Fill all pixels in the rightmost column with the color magenta (6).
3. **Preserve other colors:** Ensure that any colors other then the right-most edge are not changed.

In essence, the transformation rule is to fill the rightmost column with magenta (6), while leaving all of the other input pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
