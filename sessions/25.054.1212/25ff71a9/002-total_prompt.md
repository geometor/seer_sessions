## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47547370>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47545690>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid has a row of blue pixels (represented by '1') at the top, and the rest are white pixels (represented by '0'). The output grid shows the row of blue pixels moved to the middle row, with the top row becoming white. It appears the transformation involves a downward shift or rotation of the rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0 for white, 1 for blue)

actions:
  - type: row_shift
    description: The top row of blue pixels is moved to the middle row.

relationships:
  - input: grid with blue pixels in the top row
  - output: grid with blue pixels in the middle row
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to shift the top row of the input grid down by one position, making it the middle row in the output grid. The other rows shift accordingly, with original middle row becoming the bottom row in the input and original bottom row becoming the top row in the output. In other words, cyclically permute rows down by one.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
