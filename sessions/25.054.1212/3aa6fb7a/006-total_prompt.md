Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all distinct, contiguous shapes composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** For each azure object, determine its bounding box. This is the smallest rectangle that fully encloses the object.

3.  **Prioritized Hint Placement:** For each azure object, attempt to place a single blue (1) pixel in the following order of priority, based on the *top-left* pixel of the object's bounding box (minimum row, then minimum column):
    1.  **Left:** Place a blue pixel immediately to the left of the top-left corner of the bounding box, if the cell exists and is white(0).
    2.  **Above:** If the left position is unavailable, place a blue pixel immediately above the top-left corner of the bounding box, if the cell exists and is white(0).
    3.  **Right:** If both previous locations are not possible, check to place a blue pixel to the right of the *bottom-right* corner of the bounding box + 1 in x, if the cell exists and is white(0)
    4.  **Below:** If all previous steps do not work, check to place the blue pixel below the *bottom-right* corner of the bounding box + 1 in y, if the cell exists and is white(0).

4.  **Preserve Original:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not azure, or selected for hint placement, remain unchanged.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the testing on the second example reveals limitations in the placement logic of the blue (1) pixels. The original strategy prioritized placement to the "left" and "above" the top-left corner of the azure (8) object's bounding box.  However, the second example shows that the placement doesn't always adhere strictly to this "top-left" priority. We need to refine the rule to more accurately describe the observed behavior, and the error on the first example must be corrected. The primary issue is the placement of 'hint' pixels (blue) relative to azure objects is not consistent in terms of priority (left, above, right, below). The code tries all 4 directions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each example, focusing on:
    *   The exact locations of azure objects.
    *   The positions of the placed blue pixels relative to *all* azure pixels, not just the top-left of the bounding box. This is crucial for understanding the true placement rule.
    *   Any constraints or patterns that might be influencing the placement (e.g., are there obstacles preventing placement in certain directions?).

2.  **Refine Placement Logic:** Based on the detailed analysis, rewrite the natural language program to describe a more precise placement rule. The current rule is too simplistic. We might need to consider:
    *   Placement relative to the *entire* azure object, not just the top-left of the bounding box.
    *   A more sophisticated priority system (it is not a simple "left, above, right, below").
    *   The influence of empty and occupied cells on the placement.

3.  **Code Modification:** Update the Python code to reflect the refined natural language program.

4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated code on all available examples. Repeat the analysis and refinement process if necessary.

**Metrics and Observations using Code Execution**
I will reproduce parts of the code from above to develop accurate metrics and reports.

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all distinct, contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:**  Calculate the bounding box for each azure object.

3.  **Blue Pixel Placement:** For each azure object, place a *single* blue (1) pixel adjacent to one of the azure pixels of that object, if possible. Placement follows this logic:
  - check to see if placing *to the right* of a top-right azure pixel is possible
  - if not possible, then check to see if placing to the *left* of a bottom-left azure pixel is possible.
  - if not possible (edge of grid, or non-white adjacent cell), then do not place a blue pixel

4.  **Preservation:** All non-azure pixels in the input, that are not chosen for blue pixel placement, remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
