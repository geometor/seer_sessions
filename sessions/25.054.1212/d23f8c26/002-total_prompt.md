## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 4 0
0 3 9
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A601C0>

**output:**
```
0 4 0
0 3 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A61C00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The most noticeable change is that many of the colored pixels in the input grid become white (0) in the output grid. Only two pixels retain their original color and value. There appears to be a selection process determining which pixels to keep and which to blank out. The positions of the yellow (4) and green (3) appear to remain consistent.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - data_type: integer (0-9 representing colors)

  - type: object
    description: Pixels within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Represented by an integer (0-9).
      - position: Defined by row and column index.

  - type: transformation
    description:  Conversion of input grid to output grid.
    actions:
      - selection:  Pixels are selected to retain their original color/value.
      - blanking:  Non-selected pixels are changed to white (0).
      - persistence: Two colored blocks seem to persist.

  - type: observation
      description: colors yellow(4) and green(3) in the center of their respective rows.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Examine the input grid. Locate the pixel with the value '4' (yellow) and the pixel with value of '3'(green).
2.  **Preserve Key Pixels:** Maintain the color and position of the yellow '4' pixel and green '3' pixel in the output grid.
3. **Blank Other Pixels:** Change all other pixels in the input grid to the color white, with the color code '0'.
4. **construct new array:** Assemble the 3x3 output grid by applying the operation above.

Essentially, the rule seems to be: "Keep only the pixels with values '3' and '4', and set all other pixels to '0'".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
