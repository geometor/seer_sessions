            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too restrictive, only preserving pixels with values '3' or '4' and setting the rest to '0'. While this worked for the first example, it failed for the second and third. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify *which* pixels of value `3` or `4` should be kept and how other values in the input should be considered. It appears we are keeping certain colors and setting others to the background color, `0`.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all three input/output pairs to identify a consistent pattern. Look for a relationship between colors, not just fixed values.\n2.  **Focus on Background:** It seems the transformation involves setting some colors to the background color (0). Identify which colors are consistently treated as background.\n3.  **Conditional Logic:** We might need a rule that says \"If a pixel is color X, keep it; otherwise, set it to 0\".\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the counts of each color in the input and output grids:\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   Input:\n    *   0: 4\n    *   1: 1\n    *   3: 1\n    *   4: 1\n    *   6: 1\n    *   9: 1\n\n*   Output:\n    *   0: 7\n    *   3: 1\n    *   4: 1\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   Input\n    *   0: 11\n    *   3: 2\n    *   5: 3\n    *   6: 2\n    *   8: 2\n    *   9: 2\n*   Output\n    *   0: 20\n    *   3: 2\n    *   5: 1\n    *   9: 1\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*   Input:\n    *  0: 13\n    *  2: 2\n    *  3: 2\n    *  4: 2\n    *  6: 1\n    *  7: 2\n    *  8: 3\n\n*  Output:\n    *   0: 21\n    *   4: 2\n    *   8: 1\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 6\n      count: 1\n    - color: 4\n      count: 1\n    - color: 0\n      count: 4\n    - color: 3\n      count: 1\n    - color: 9\n      count: 1\n    - color: 1\n      count: 1\n  output_objects:\n    - color: 0\n      count: 7\n    - color: 4\n      count: 1\n    - color: 3\n      count: 1\n  transformation:\n    - keep: [4, 3]\n    - set_to_background: [0, 6, 9, 1]\n\nexample_2:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 8\n      count: 2\n    - color: 0\n      count: 11\n    - color: 3\n      count: 2\n    - color: 5\n      count: 3\n    - color: 6\n      count: 2\n    - color: 9\n      count: 2\n  output_objects:\n     - color: 0\n       count: 20\n     - color: 3\n       count: 2\n     - color: 5\n       count: 1\n     - color: 9\n       count: 1\n  transformation:\n    - keep: [3, 5, 9]\n    - set_to_background: [8, 0, 6]\n\nexample_3:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 3\n      count: 2\n    - color: 0\n      count: 13\n    - color: 4\n      count: 2\n    - color: 6\n      count: 1\n    - color: 7\n      count: 2\n    - color: 8\n      count: 3\n    - color: 2\n      count: 2\n  output_objects:\n    - color: 0\n      count: 21\n    - color: 4\n      count: 2\n    - color: 8\n      count: 1\n\n  transformation:\n    - keep: [4, 8]\n    - set_to_background: [3, 0, 6, 7, 2]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Examine each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  Identify the colors present in all output grids from the training examples.\n3.  If the pixel's color is present in all of the output grids, keep its original value in the output grid.\n4.  If the pixel's color is *not* present in all of the output grids, set its value to 0 (background) in the output grid.\n"
