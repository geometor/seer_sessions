## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 5 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7BFC475030D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7BFC47502E60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The grids appear to have the same dimensions (3 rows x 11 columns in this example). The transformation seems to involve a combination of:
1.  color replacement and dropping
2.  shifting

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 11
      - cells: integers (0-9)

  - type: color_group
    description: Contiguous block of same color pixels.
    properties:
     - color_value: integer #example specific

actions:
  - type: replace
    description: replace one color with another
    parameters:
      - source_color: 5, 6
      - target_color: 0, 8

  - type: shift_down
    description: shift the color group down one cell
    parameters:
        - rows: [1]

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: transformation by actions, shift, and replace
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify target color groups:** Find the groups in the input grid of color 5, and color 6.
2.  **Replace color groups:**
    *   Replace all color 5's with color 0.
    *   Replace all color 6's with color 8.

3.  **Locate shifted groups:** Identify the color groups that consist of colors 8.

4.  **Shift to row 3**: Move the first identified color group to the location of the second identified color group.

5. **Shift to row 2**: Move the second identifed color group down to replace color 5 in row 3.

6. **Shift color 2 group**: if there is a horizontal group of color 2 in row 2, shift the group of color 2 to the vertical position of the first color 8 group.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
