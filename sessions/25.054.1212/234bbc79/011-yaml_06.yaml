observations:
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: 5 # Grey
          action: Replaced with smaller blue object, shifted position.
        - color: 1 # Blue
          action: Size reduced.
        - color: 2 # Red
          action: Remains mostly unchanged in shape, may shift position.
      output_size: Determined by bounding box of transformed objects, except zero rows/cols are trimmed.
  - example_2:
      objects:
        - color: 5 # Grey
          action: Replaced by smaller blue object, some disappear.
        - color: 1 # Blue
          action: Some disappear or become white.
        - color: 2 # Red
          action: Remains unchanged.
        - color: 3 # Green
          action: Remains unchanged.
      output_size: Determined by bounding box of transformed objects, except zero rows/cols are trimmed.
  - example_3:
      objects:
        - color: 5 # Grey
          action: Replaced by smaller blue object. Some are combined based on proximity.
        - color: 8 # Azure
          action: Combines with nearby color 6, all becoming 6.
        - color: 6 # Magenta
          action: Combines with color 8.
        - color: 2 # Red
          action: Remains unchanged.
      output_size: Determined by bounding box of transformed objects, except zero rows/cols are trimmed.
  - example_4:
        - color: 5
          action: Replaced by smaller blue object
        - color: 1
          action: size reduced, may remain
        - color: 2
          action: Remains but position might be changed.
      output_size: Determined by bounding box of transformed objects, except zero rows/cols are trimmed
