## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 5 1 0 5 2 2
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7BFC48908D00>

**output:**
```
0 2 1 1 0 0 0
2 2 0 1 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7BFC4890B040>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The grids appear to be smaller versions of the JPEGs provided. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid and changes in the values of certain pixels. The most prominent change is the replacement of 5s with other colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x9 (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: [white, gray, red, blue]  # Based on provided values
    
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x7 (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: [white, red, blue]

  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: string

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Change the value/color of a pixel.
  - name: reduce_size
    description: reduce the number of columns

relationships:
 - input_grid contains pixels
 - output_grid contains pixels
 - corresponding_pixels:  input and output may have related pixels by index
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Column Reduction:** The output grid has fewer columns than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has 7 columns while the input has 9. Columns are removed. The rule to determine which columns are removed is not immediately obvious, but it's consistent across the example: columns 3 and 6 of the *input* are removed (counting from 0).

2.  **Color Replacement (5s):** All pixels with a value of '5' (gray) in the input grid are changed.

3.  **Replacement Logic:**
    *   Input '5' pixels directly above or below a '1' (blue) become '1' (blue).
    *   Input '5' pixels adjacent to a '2' (red) become '2'(red) if the '5' is at the edge and a '2' exist.

4.  **Other Pixels:** Pixels that are not '5' in the input grid retain their original values in the output grid, maintaining relative position after column removal.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
