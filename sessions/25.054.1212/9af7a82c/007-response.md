Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to contain distinct colored regions, while the output grid expands upon this, introducing a significant amount of white space (represented by '0'). The relative positioning of the original colors appears to be somewhat maintained, but mirrored and possibly inverted. There's a clear expansion in size, suggesting a scaling or replication factor at play, coupled with a transformation of the layout.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x4
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    observations:
      - "Contains distinct color blocks: green (3), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4)."
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 6x4
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    observations:
      - "Larger than the input grid."
      - "Mostly filled with white (0)."
      - "Preserves some color relationships from the input, but mirrored."
  - relationship: transformation
    type: input_to_output
    description: "The input grid is transformed into the output grid through a process involving mirroring, expansion, and color preservation, likely following an identifiable rule."
    details:
      - "Horizontal mirroring and expansion are apparent, yellow remains in the leftmost column"
      - "The input grid appears in reverse order of columns from right to left"
      - "Each row is expanded downward by copying the input row until the left most column is filled."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the height of the input grid but with same width. Fill the entire output grid with 0 (white).

2.  **Reverse Column Order:** Process the columns of the input grid in reverse order (from right to left).

3.  **Column-wise Transformation:** For each column in the input grid (processed in reverse):
    *   Copy the color values from the input column, starting from the top, into the corresponding column of the output grid from top row down, until the bottom row is reached.

4.  **Fill with white:** After placing the colors in the output, any remaining cells at that stage are left at their initial value (0, representing white).

In summary, the transformation reverses the order of columns, expands to left with repeats of the input row, and fills the remaining space with 0.
