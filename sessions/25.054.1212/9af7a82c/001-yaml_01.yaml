facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
      - observation: each cell's value corresponds to a color.

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x3
      - values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
      - observation: dimensions are related to input grid dimensions; presence of '0' values.

  - type: transformation
    description: input to output
    properties:
      - relationship: input values seem to map to output columns.
      - observation: input dimensions * constant = output dims
      - observation: "height" seems like a more critical/driving attribute than "width"
      - observation: "0" (white color) is used as an empty cell
