The colors in the input grid seem to dictate the structure and colors in the output grid. There's a clear relationship between the input grid's dimensions and the output grid's dimensions. Specifically the height of input is multiplied by a constant to make the height of the output, while the input's width is also multiplied by a constant to create the output width. The numbers/colors in the input seem to map to columns in the output, with '0' (white) appearing where a number is absent.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

That number of rows containing '1' + 2. Each row contains 1 value of '1'. The output grid's width is the same as the input's width.\n\n2.  **Iterate through Input Grid:** For each column in the input grid, create a column of the output grid by duplicating the value the number of times as the number of rows.\n\n3.  **Populate Output:**\n    *   Iterate through each column from the input grid.\n    *   For input grid columns: Create an output column where: The cells from top to bottom will contain a number from left to right of the input grid, and the rest will be filled with \"0\".\n    *   Example input column `[2, 3, 1]` becomes output column `[1, 2, 3, 0, 0]`\n\nIn summary the transformation stacks the values from the input column into output column, and completes with white cells.\n"
