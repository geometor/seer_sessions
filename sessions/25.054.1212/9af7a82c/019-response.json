The input grid appears to have a smaller height and width compared to the output grid. There's a noticeable change in the arrangement and colors of pixels. The input grid seems to contain three distinct columns, which appear to be re-arranged and expanded in the output. Some colors are changed, for example the first column, containing color `1`, which remains as `1`, the second containing `2`, also remains `2`, and the third column, with values `1`, `1`, `8`, `8`, gets replaced with `8, 8, 0, 0`. The layout changes from 3 columns of 4 rows to 3 columns of 6 rows. The last two rows contain only the value `1` in the first columns, and zeros elsewhere.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
