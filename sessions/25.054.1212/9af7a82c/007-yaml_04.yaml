facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 3x4
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    observations:
      - "Contains distinct color blocks: green (3), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4)."
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 6x4
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    observations:
      - "Larger than the input grid."
      - "Mostly filled with white (0)."
      - "Preserves some color relationships from the input, but mirrored."
  - relationship: transformation
    type: input_to_output
    description: "The input grid is transformed into the output grid through a process involving mirroring, expansion, and color preservation, likely following an identifiable rule."
    details:
      - "Horizontal mirroring and expansion are apparent, yellow remains in the leftmost column"
      - "The input grid appears in reverse order of columns from right to left"
      - "Each row is expanded downward by copying the input row until the left most column is filled."
