## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 8 2
3 8 8
3 3 4
3 3 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x7BFC48DA7D90>

**output:**
```
3 8 4 2
3 8 4 0
3 8 0 0
3 8 0 0
3 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x320 at 0x7BFC4890B7F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, including my perception of elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grid seems to be transformed into the output grid based on some rule involving the colors and positions of the pixels. It appears that columns are being reordered or replaced, and some are being set to zero (white). The specific colors in the input seem important for determining which color ends up where in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      cells: [color_values]
  - type: color
    properties:
      value: [integer, 0-9]
      name: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]

actions:
  - type: reorder_columns
    description: Rearrange the order of columns based on an unknown rule.
  - type: replace_column
    description:  Replace entire columns with a specific color, potentially zero (white).

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains original arrangement of colored pixels.
  - output_grid: Contains transformed arrangement of colored pixels.
  - color_mapping: Defines the integer-to-color relationship.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Observe the input grid. The columns containing colors '8' (azure) and '3'(green) are significant, and are maintained. The column that has '2' (red) moves to the last position, while the column that has yellow ('4') moves to the second to last.

2.  **Column Reordering:**
    *   The first and second column of the output grid are copies of the '3' and '8' columns in the original, respectively.
    *   The third column of the output is a copy of the last input column which contains color `4`.
    *   The fourth column of the output is copy of the first input column which has color `2`.

3.  **Zeroing Out (Replacement):**
    Any remaining columns that are lower in the y axis than a maintained element are set to '0' (white).

In summary, the transformation involves finding the positions of colors '3','8','4' and '2' in the input, preserving those, reordering the '4' and'2' columns, and setting cells to zero (white) below maintained elements.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
