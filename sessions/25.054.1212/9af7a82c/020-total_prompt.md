## Example 4

**input:**
```
1 1 1
2 2 1
2 8 1
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x7BFC475013F0>

**output:**
```
1 2 8
1 2 8
1 2 0
1 2 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC4890A200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a smaller height and width compared to the output grid. There's a noticeable change in the arrangement and colors of pixels. The input grid seems to contain three distinct columns, which appear to be re-arranged and expanded in the output. Some colors are changed, for example the first column, containing color `1`, which remains as `1`, the second containing `2`, also remains `2`, and the third column, with values `1`, `1`, `8`, `8`, gets replaced with `8, 8, 0, 0`. The layout changes from 3 columns of 4 rows to 3 columns of 6 rows. The last two rows contain only the value `1` in the first columns, and zeros elsewhere.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x3 (height x width)
      - values: integers (representing colors)
      - columns: 3
      - rows: 4
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - values: integers (representing colors)
      - columns: 3
      - rows: 6
  - observation: color_mapping
    details: Input colors are mostly maintained in their relative column positions, with a change in the last column replacing color '1' with '0', except on the first and second row.
  - observation: spatial_transformation
    details: The output grid is larger than the input grid. The columns of the input appear reordered and repeated or changed in the output.
  - observation: row_addition
      details: Two new rows are added filled with color '1' in column 1 and '0' in the rest.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Read** the input grid's pixel values.
2.  **Copy** first column of the input to the first column of the output.
3.  **Copy** second column of the input to the second column of the output.
4.  **Column 3 transformation**: The third column is changed: the values 1, 1, 8, and 8, are replaced by 8, 8, 0, and 0, and written on the first 4 rows of the third column of the output.
5.  **Create** two additional rows at the bottom of the output grid.
6.  **Fill** first column of added rows with color blue (1).
7.  **Fill** the rest of added rows with color white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
