Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid. Each element in the input grid maintains its original color/value, but its position changes according to the rotation.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The rotated grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise.
    rotated_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)  # k=-1 for clockwise rotation

    # Convert the rotated array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = rotated_array.tolist()

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
