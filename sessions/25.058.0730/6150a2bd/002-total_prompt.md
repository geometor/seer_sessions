## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x77844EADE5D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x77844EADECB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors.  The transformation appears to be a rotation of the entire grid. The colors themselves seem to be maintained; that is, the transformation is purely spatial. The direction and degree of rotation are key to understanding the rule.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color
    transformation_type: rotation
    rotation_direction: clockwise
    rotation_degree: 90
  - input:
    grid: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
  - output:
    grid: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid.  Each element in the input grid maintains its original color/value, but its position changes according to the rotation.

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Process:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  **Output:** The rotated 3x3 grid.

Specifically:
*   The top-left element of the input becomes the top-right element of the output.
*   The top-center element of the input becomes the right-center element of the output.
*   The top-right element of the input becomes the bottom-right element of the output.
*   The center-left element of the input becomes the top-center element of the output.
*   The center element remains the center element of the output.
*   The center-right element of the input becomes the bottom-center of the output.
*   The bottom-left element of the input becomes to top-left element of the output.
*   The bottom-center element of the input becomes the left-center element of the output.
*   The bottom-right element of the input becomes the bottom-left element of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
