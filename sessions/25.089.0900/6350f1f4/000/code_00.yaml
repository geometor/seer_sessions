constants:
  - color_white: 0
  - adjacency_type: non-diagonal (up, down, left, right)

variables:
  - input_grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - output_grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
  - grid_dimensions: height and width of the input/output grids
  - dominant_color: The color identified as the primary agent of change.
  - target_pixel: A pixel whose color might change.
  - neighbor_pixel: A pixel adjacent to the target_pixel.

properties:
  - white pixels (color_white) are static and never change.
  - The dominant_color is determined by the color of the pixel at index (0, 0) in the input_grid.
  - Target_pixels are those whose color is neither color_white nor the dominant_color.

actions:
  - identify_dominant_color: Get the color from input_grid[0, 0].
  - iterate_pixels: Process each pixel (r, c) in the input_grid.
  - check_neighbors: For a target_pixel, examine its non-diagonal neighbors in the input_grid.
  - update_pixel: If a target_pixel has at least one neighbor with the dominant_color in the input_grid, change the target_pixel's color to the dominant_color in the output_grid. Otherwise, the pixel retains its original color.

relationships:
  - Adjacency: A target_pixel's potential change depends on the color of its adjacent neighbors in the input grid.
  - Dominance: The dominant_color replaces the color of adjacent target_pixels.
  - Invariance: White pixels and pixels already having the dominant_color are unaffected by the transformation.
