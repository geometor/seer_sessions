            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are rectangular grids of varying sizes (5x5 and 11x11 in the examples).\n2.  **Color Palette:** Multiple colors are used: green (3), red (2), white (0), blue (1), azure (8), gray (5), yellow (4). White (0) seems to act as a background or separator.\n3.  **Invariant Pixels:** White (0) pixels remain unchanged in all examples.\n4.  **Color Changes:** Other colors change based on their adjacency to a specific \"dominant\" color.\n5.  **Dominant Color Identification:** In each example pair, one color seems to take precedence and \"spread\" to adjacent, non-white pixels.\n    *   Example 1: Green (3) is dominant. Red (2) changes to green (3) if adjacent to green.\n    *   Example 2: Blue (1) is dominant. Azure (8) and Gray (5) change to blue (1) if adjacent to blue.\n    *   Example 3: Green (3) is dominant. Yellow (4) and Gray (5) change to green (3) if adjacent to green.\n    *   Example 4: Yellow (4) is dominant. Red (2) and Gray (5) change to yellow (4) if adjacent to yellow.\n6.  **Dominant Color Source:** The dominant color appears to be the color of the top-left pixel (0, 0) in the input grid in all provided examples.\n7.  **Adjacency Rule:** The color change depends on non-diagonal adjacency (sharing an edge: up, down, left, or right). A pixel changes *if* at least one of its adjacent neighbors in the *input* grid has the dominant color.\n8.  **Target Pixels:** Only pixels that are *not* white and *not* the dominant color are candidates for changing.\n9.  **Transformation Logic:** The transformation identifies the dominant color from the top-left pixel. It then iterates through the grid. Any pixel that isn't white or the dominant color changes *to* the dominant color if it's adjacent to a dominant-colored pixel in the original input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
