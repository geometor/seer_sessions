Task: Extract a specific horizontal slice from the input grid.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Height: H_in
      - Width: W_in
      - Pixels: Array of colors (0-9)
  - Structure: Composed of vertically stacked slices.

Output_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Height: H_out
      - Width: W_out (W_out == W_in)
      - Pixels: Array of colors (0-9)
  - Relationship_to_Input: Is one of the horizontal slices of the Input_Grid.

Slice:
  - Properties:
      - Height: H_slice (H_slice == H_out)
      - Width: W_slice (W_slice == W_in)
      - Index: Position in the vertical stack (0-indexed from top)
      - Pixels: Sub-array of Input_Grid pixels
      - Colors_Present: Set of unique colors within the slice
      - Content_Pixel_Count: Number of pixels whose color is not a Background_Color.

Background_Colors:
  - Definition: Set of colors that are present in *every* Slice of the Input_Grid.
  - Role: Represent background or framing elements, not primary content.

Selection_Rule:
  - Action: Compare slices based on their Content_Pixel_Count.
  - Condition: The Slice with the maximum Content_Pixel_Count is selected.
  - Tie-breaking: If multiple slices share the maximum count, the one with the lowest Index (topmost) is selected (although not observed in examples).
  - Result: The selected Slice becomes the Output_Grid.

Assumptions:
  - H_in is divisible by H_out.
  - W_in is equal to W_out.
  - There are at least two slices to compare to determine Background_Colors effectively (if only one slice, it is the output).
