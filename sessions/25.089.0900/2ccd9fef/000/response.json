            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe task involves extracting a specific horizontal subgrid (a slice) from a larger input grid. The input grids appear to be composed of vertically stacked repeating or related patterns/blocks. The height of the output grid dictates the height of these blocks or slices within the input grid. The core challenge is identifying *which* slice from the input becomes the output.\n\nObserving the two examples:\n\n1.  **Example 1:** Input is 24x11, output is 8x11. The input can be seen as three 8x11 slices stacked vertically. The output corresponds to the middle slice (rows 8-15).\n2.  **Example 2:** Input is 21x11, output is 7x11. The input can be seen as three 7x11 slices stacked vertically. The output corresponds to the middle slice (rows 7-13).\n\nIt seems we need a criterion to select the correct slice. Let's analyze the content of the slices:\n\n*   In Example 1, the slices contain colors {white(1), yellow(4), green(3), azure(8)}, {white(1), yellow(4), green(3), azure(8)}, and {white(1), yellow(4)} respectively. The colors common to all slices are white(1) and yellow(4), likely acting as background or frame. The \"content\" colors are green(3) and azure(8). Slice 1 has 7 content pixels, Slice 2 has 11, and Slice 3 has 0. The output (Slice 2) has the maximum number of content pixels.\n*   In Example 2, the slices contain colors {red(2), azure(8), blue(1), yellow(4)}, {red(2), azure(8), blue(1), yellow(4)}, and {red(2), azure(8)} respectively. The colors common to all slices are red(2) and azure(8). The \"content\" colors are blue(1) and yellow(4). Slice 1 has 6 content pixels, Slice 2 has 8, and Slice 3 has 0. The output (Slice 2) has the maximum number of content pixels.\n\nThis suggests a rule based on maximizing the count of non-background/non-frame pixels within a slice.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
