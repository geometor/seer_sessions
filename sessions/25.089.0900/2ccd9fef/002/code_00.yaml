Task: Extract and modify a specific horizontal slice from the input grid.

Input_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Height: H_in
      - Width: W_in
      - Pixels: Array of colors (0-9)
  - Structure: Assumed to be composed of exactly 3 vertically stacked slices of equal height.

Output_Grid:
  - Properties:
      - Height: H_out (H_out == H_in / 3)
      - Width: W_out (W_out == W_in)
      - Pixels: Array of colors (0-9)
  - Relationship_to_Input: A transformed version of one of the horizontal slices of the Input_Grid.

Slice:
  - Properties:
      - Height: H_slice (H_slice == H_out)
      - Width: W_slice (W_slice == W_in)
      - Index: Position in the vertical stack (0-indexed from top)
      - Pixels: Sub-array of Input_Grid pixels
      - Colors_Present: Set of unique colors within the slice
      - Content_Pixel_Count: Number of pixels whose color is not a Background_Color.

Background_Colors:
  - Definition: Set of colors that are present in *every* Slice of the Input_Grid.
  - Role: Represent background or framing elements.

Content_Colors:
  - Definition: Set of colors present in the Selected_Slice but not in the Background_Colors set.
  - Role: Represent foreground objects that undergo transformation.

Fill_Color:
  - Definition: The color within the Background_Colors set that has the highest frequency (count) within the Selected_Slice.
  - Role: Represents the area/pixels that can be overwritten during horizontal expansion.

Selection_Rule:
  - Action: Compare slices based on their Content_Pixel_Count.
  - Condition: The Slice with the maximum Content_Pixel_Count is selected (Selected_Slice).
  - Tie-breaking: If multiple slices share the maximum count, the one with the lowest Index (topmost) is selected.

Transformation_Rule (Applied to Selected_Slice):
  - Action: Horizontal Expansion.
  - For each pixel (r, c) in the Selected_Slice:
      - If the pixel's color is a Content_Color:
          - Expand Left: Check pixels (r, c-1), (r, c-2), ... Change their color to the content color *if* their original color was the Fill_Color. Stop expanding left when the grid boundary is reached or a pixel is encountered that is *not* the Fill_Color.
          - Expand Right: Check pixels (r, c+1), (r, c+2), ... Change their color to the content color *if* their original color was the Fill_Color. Stop expanding right when the grid boundary is reached or a pixel is encountered that is *not* the Fill_Color.
  - Result: The transformed Selected_Slice becomes the Output_Grid.

Assumptions:
  - Input height is divisible by 3.
  - Input grid is not empty.
  - There is always at least one background color present in the selected slice to determine a Fill_Color (or a default behavior is needed if not).
