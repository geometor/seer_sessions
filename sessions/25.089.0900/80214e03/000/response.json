These objects appear to be arranged in a rough grid-like pattern (e.g., 3x3 in train_1, 2x2 in train_2, 2x3 in train_3). The output grid's dimensions correspond to this implicit grid structure in the input. The colors in the output grid are derived from the colors of the objects in the corresponding input regions, but the columns are reversed within each row.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
