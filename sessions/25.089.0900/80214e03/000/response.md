*   **Perception**: The input grids contain multiple distinct, single-colored objects separated by white space. These objects appear to be arranged in a rough grid-like pattern (e.g., 3x3 in train_1, 2x2 in train_2, 2x3 in train_3). The output grid's dimensions correspond to this implicit grid structure in the input. The colors in the output grid are derived from the colors of the objects in the corresponding input regions, but the columns are reversed within each row.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: grid_transformation
    input_features:
      - description: A large grid containing white pixels (0) as background.
      - description: Multiple distinct objects, each composed of a single non-white color.
      - description: Objects are spatially separated by white pixels.
      - description: The arrangement of objects suggests an underlying grid structure (rows and columns).
    output_features:
      - description: A smaller grid whose dimensions match the implicit grid structure of the input objects.
      - description: Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a region in the input's implicit grid.
      - description: The color of an output cell is determined by the color of the object(s) occupying the corresponding input region.
    transformation:
      - step: Identify the implicit grid structure (M rows, N columns) based on the spatial arrangement of non-white objects in the input.
      - step: Create an intermediate M x N grid.
      - step: For each cell (r, c) in the intermediate grid, determine the color by finding the non-white color present within the corresponding spatial region of the input grid. (Assumption: Each region contains only one non-white color based on examples).
      - step: Create the final output grid by reversing the order of elements (colors) in each row of the intermediate grid (horizontal reflection).
    relationships:
      - The output grid size is determined by the number of rows and columns in the spatial grouping of input objects.
      - The color in output cell (r, c') is the color found in the input region corresponding to the intermediate cell (r, c), where c' is the horizontally reflected column index of c.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Analyze the input grid to identify the spatial grid layout formed by the arrangement of the colored objects. Determine the number of rows (M) and columns (N) in this layout.
    2.  Create an intermediate grid of size M x N.
    3.  For each cell (row `r`, column `c`) in the M x N layout of the input grid:
        a.  Identify the spatial region corresponding to this cell.
        b.  Find the single non-white color present within this region.
        c.  Assign this color to the cell (`r`, `c`) in the intermediate grid.
    4.  Create the final output grid of size M x N.
    5.  For each row `r` (from 0 to M-1) in the intermediate grid:
        a.  Reverse the order of the colors in that row.
        b.  Place the reversed sequence of colors into row `r` of the final output grid.
    6.  Return the final output grid.
