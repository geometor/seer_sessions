"""
Identifies specific 6x6 shapes within an input grid based on non-background, non-noise colors.
Filters these shapes to keep only those with exact 6x6 bounding boxes.
Determines the stacking order based on the top-left corner of the shapes (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), 
reversing this order if any Orange (7) pixels are present in the original input.
Extracts each selected shape's 6x6 area from the input.
Cleans the extracted 6x6 grids by replacing noise pixels (Gray=5, Orange=7, Maroon=9) with the background color.
Vertically stacks the cleaned 6x6 grids in the determined order to produce the final output grid.
