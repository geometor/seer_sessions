**General Assessment**

The previous code failed on all examples with a `list index out of range` error. The root cause analysis revealed that the initial strategy of identifying contiguous non-background/non-noise objects and then filtering them based on whether their *minimal* bounding box was exactly 6x6 was incorrect. The examples show that the relevant shapes *reside within* specific 6x6 regions, but their own pixels might not span the full 6x6 area.

The revised strategy involves:
1.  Identifying the background color and noise colors.
2.  Using a sliding window approach to find all 6x6 subgrids in the input.
3.  Selecting only those 6x6 windows that contain at least one pixel that is neither background nor noise.
4.  Ordering these selected windows based on their top-left coordinates (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
5.  Reversing this order if the original input grid contains any Orange (7) pixels.
6.  Extracting each selected 6x6 window.
7.  Cleaning each extracted window by replacing noise pixels (Gray=5, Orange=7, Maroon=9) with the background color.
8.  Vertically stacking the cleaned windows to produce the output.

This approach directly targets the 6x6 structure observed in the outputs and correctly incorporates the noise-cleaning step and the conditional order reversal.

**Analysis of Metrics Results**

The metrics reveal a significant flaw in the "sliding window + contains non-background/non-noise" strategy: it identifies far too many candidate windows (e.g., 166 in `train_1` where only 3 are expected). The condition `np.any((window != bg_color) & (~np.isin(window, list(noise_colors))))` is too permissive. It correctly identifies the presence of target object pixels but doesn't sufficiently constrain *which* 6x6 windows are the correct ones to extract.

**Refined Hypothesis / Strategy Revision**

We need a better way to pinpoint the *exact* 6x6 windows. Let's reconsider the original `find_objects` approach but adapt it.

1.  **Find Objects First:** Identify all contiguous groups of non-background, non-noise pixels, just like the initial `find_objects` function did. Calculate the minimal bounding box for each *object*.
2.  **Center in 6x6:** For each found object, determine its center point (or top-left point, or some other representative point). Perhaps the task requires placing the *minimal bounding box* of the object within a 6x6 grid, aligning it in a specific way (e.g., centered, top-left aligned)? This seems complex.
3.  **Fixed 6x6 Grids:** What if the 6x6 grids are located at specific, predictable positions within the larger grid? Unlikely in ARC.
4.  **Markers Revisited:** Could the noise pixels (especially Gray=5) be markers for the *corners* or *centers* of the 6x6 regions?
    *   **Train 1:** Gray pixels at (2, 3), (2, 17), (9, 7), (16, 10), (19, 0). Output shapes correspond to input regions starting roughly at (7, 2), (7, 7), (8, 11). The gray pixel at (9, 7) is *inside* the second target 6x6 region (7,7) to (12,12). The others don't seem directly related to the *start* corners (7,2), (7,7), (8,11).
    *   **Train 2:** Gray pixels at (1, 0), (7, 2), (9, 6). Target regions start at (1, 2), (1, 2) ? Wait, the shapes overlap significantly in input. This suggests the object finding must be robust. Target regions: (1,2) -> (6,7) for Yellow/Azure shape, (1,2) -> (6,7) for Blue shape? The output shows Yellow, then Azure, then Blue. The shapes in input are Yellow(4) at (1,3)-(1,4), (2,2)-(2,5), (3,1)-(3,6), (4,1)-(4,6), (5,2)-(5,5), (6,3)-(6,4). Bbox: (1,6,1,6) -> 6x6. Azure(8) at (2,4), (3,3), (4,2),(4,7), (5,7), (6,6). Bbox: (2,6,2,7) -> 5x6. Blue(1) at (4,3), (5,1),(5,4),(5,6), (6,0),(6,5), (7,0),(7,6), (8,1),(8,4), (9,2),(9,3). Bbox: (4,9,0,6) -> 6x7.
        *   My previous bounding box calculations were wrong or the object finder was flawed. Let's re-run the *original* object finder logic mentally on `train_2`:
            *   BG=3, Noise={5}
            *   Shape 1 (Yellow/Azure/Blue combined?): Starts BFS at (1,3) [Yellow=4]. Finds all connected 4, 8, 1. Minimal box containing *all* these pixels? Min R=1, Max R=9. Min C=0, Max C=7. Bbox(1, 9, 0, 7) -> 9x8.
        *   This confirms the original `find_objects` was merging distinct shapes if they touched. It needs modification to only group pixels of the *same* color.

**Revised Strategy 2.0:**

1.  Determine background color.
2.  Define noise colors {5, 7, 9}.
3.  Find *potential* objects: Iterate through the grid. If a pixel `(r, c)` is non-background and non-noise, and hasn't been visited:
    *   Start a BFS from `(r, c)`.
    *   The BFS queue only adds neighbors `(nr, nc)` if `grid[nr, nc]` is the *same color* as `grid[r, c]` and `(nr, nc)` hasn't been visited.
    *   Record all visited pixels for this object.
    *   Calculate the minimal bounding box `(min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)` for *this specific object*.
4.  **Filter by Size:** Keep only objects whose minimal bounding box height (`max_r - min_r + 1`) and width (`max_c - min_c + 1`) are both `<= 6`. (Maybe exactly 6? Let's try `<= 6` first).
5.  **Determine 6x6 Extraction Window:** For each filtered object, how do we determine the corresponding 6x6 window to extract from the input?
    *   Hypothesis: The 6x6 window is the one whose top-left corner `(win_r, win_c)` minimizes the distance (e.g., Euclidean or Manhattan) to the object's center or top-left corner, *subject to the constraint that the entire object's minimal bounding box fits within the window*. OR, perhaps the 6x6 window is simply defined by the object's `min_r` and `min_c`, i.e., `input[min_r:min_r+6, min_c:min_c+6]`? Let's test this simpler idea first. If an object's minimal bounding box starts at `(min_r, min_c)`, extract the 6x6 window starting there.
6.  **Consolidate Overlapping Windows?** What if multiple distinct objects (found in step 3) fall into the *same* starting 6x6 window defined in step 5? The output seems to show combined shapes if they originated in the same 6x6 region (e.g., Yellow and Azure in train_2 might originate from the same 6x6 window extraction). This suggests we should find the unique *starting corners* `(min_r, min_c)` from the filtered objects and use those to define the windows.
7.  Refined Steps:
    a. Find background color (BG) and noise colors (N).
    b. Find all contiguous objects of the *same* color `C` where `C != BG` and `C not in N`. Store each object's pixels and its minimal bounding box `(min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c)`.
    c. Filter these objects: Keep only those where `height <= 6` and `width <= 6`.
    d. Determine unique 6x6 target window top-left corners: For each filtered object, the potential corner is `(min_r, min_c)`. Collect all unique `(min_r, min_c)` pairs generated from *all* filtered objects. Let this set be `TargetCorners`.
    e. Sort `TargetCorners` by row, then column.
    f. Check original input for Orange (7). If present, reverse the sorted `TargetCorners`.
    g. For each corner `(r, c)` in the final ordered list:
        i. Extract `subgrid = input[r:r+6, c:c+6].copy()`. Check bounds: ensure `r+6 <= input_rows` and `c+6 <= input_cols`.
        ii. Clean the `subgrid`: replace noise colors {5, 7, 9} with the background color.
        iii. Add cleaned `subgrid` to a list.
    h. Stack the list of cleaned subgrids vertically.

Let's dry run this on `train_1`:
- BG=2, Noise={5, 9}
- Object 1: Yellow(4). Pixels: (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,5), (9,2), (9,6), (10,2), (10,6), (11,2), (11,5), (12,3), (12,4). Bbox: (7, 12, 2, 6). Height=6, Width=5. <=6x6. Keep. Corner: (7, 2).
- Object 2: Azure(8). Pixels: (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,10), (9,7), (9,11), (10,7), (10,11), (11,7), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9). Bbox: (7, 12, 7, 11). Height=6, Width=5. <=6x6. Keep. Corner: (7, 7).
- Object 3: Green(3). Pixels: (8,12), (8,13), (9,14), (10,11), (10,15), (11,12), (11,15), (12,11), (12,14), (13,12), (13,13). Bbox: (8, 13, 11, 15). Height=6, Width=5. <=6x6. Keep. Corner: (8, 11).
- Other Pixels: Red(2)=BG. Gray(5)=Noise. Maroon(9)=Noise.
- Unique Corners: {(7, 2), (7, 7), (8, 11)}
- Sort: [(7, 2), (7, 7), (8, 11)]
- No Orange(7). Order remains the same.
- Extract window at (7, 2): `input[7:13, 2:8]`. Clean noise (Gray=5 at (9,7), Maroon=9 at (10, 13) - these are *absolute* coordinates, need relative: Gray is at relative (2,5), Maroon is not in this window).
- Extract window at (7, 7): `input[7:13, 7:13]`. Clean noise (Gray=5 at absolute (9,7) -> relative (2,0), Maroon=9 at absolute (10,13) -> not in window).
- Extract window at (8, 11): `input[8:14, 11:17]`. Clean noise (Gray=5 at absolute (9,7) -> not in window, Maroon=9 at absolute (10,13) -> relative (2,2), Maroon=9 at absolute (11,13) -> relative (3,2)).
- Stack these three cleaned 6x6 windows. Output size: 18x6. Matches example 1.

Dry run `train_3`:
- BG=4, Noise={5, 7, 9}. Note: Orange=7 is noise *and* reverses order.
- Find objects (color, bbox, corner):
    - Red(2): Bbox(2,6,2,4), H=5, W=3. <=6x6. Corner(2,2).
    - Azure(8): Bbox(5,10,5,8), H=6, W=4. <=6x6. Corner(5,5).
    - Green(3): Bbox(8,12,7,12), H=5, W=6. <=6x6. Corner(8,7).
- Unique Corners: {(2, 2), (5, 5), (8, 7)}
- Sort: [(2, 2), (5, 5), (8, 7)]
- Orange(7) is present in input. Reverse order: [(8, 7), (5, 5), (2, 2)]
- Extract window (8, 7): `input[8:14, 7:13]`. Clean noise (Orange=7, Gray=5).
- Extract window (5, 5): `input[5:11, 5:11]`. Clean noise.
- Extract window (2, 2): `input[2:8, 2:8]`. Clean noise.
- Stack these three cleaned 6x6 windows. Output size: 18x6. Matches example 3.

This revised strategy seems robust and consistent with all examples.

**YAML Facts Block**


```yaml
task_description: >
  Identify distinct, same-colored contiguous objects (non-background, non-noise) whose minimal bounding box fits within 6x6.
  Use the top-left corner of each such object's bounding box to define the top-left corner of a 6x6 window to extract from the input.
  Collect all unique 6x6 window definitions. Order them top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on their top-left corner.
  If the input grid contains any Orange (7) pixels, reverse this order.
  Extract each 6x6 window, clean it by replacing noise pixels (Gray=5, Orange=7, Maroon=9) with the background color,
  and vertically stack the cleaned windows to create the output.

    properties:
      - size: Exactly 6x6 pixels.
      - location: Defined by a top-left corner (r, c) derived from the minimal bounding box corner of a valid 'object'. Unique corners define the set of windows.
      - content: Pixels copied from the input grid at the specified location.

  - element: noise_pixel

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color, which is the most frequent color in the input grid.
2.  Define the set of noise colors as {Gray (5), Orange (7), Maroon (9)}.
3.  Find all contiguous objects in the input grid. An object consists of connected pixels of the *same* color, where that color is *not* the background color and *not* a noise color. For each object found, determine its minimal bounding box (top row, bottom row, left column, right column).
4.  Filter these objects, keeping only those whose bounding box height (bottom row - top row + 1) is 6 or less, AND whose bounding box width (right column - left column + 1) is 6 or less.
5.  Create a list of the top-left corner coordinates (top row, left column) from the bounding boxes of all the filtered objects found in step 4.
6.  Remove duplicate coordinates from this list to get a list of unique window corners.
7.  Sort the unique window corners primarily by row index (ascending) and secondarily by column index (ascending).
8.  Check the entire original input grid to see if it contains any Orange (7) pixels.
9.  If Orange (7) pixels are present, reverse the sorted list of unique window corners.
10. Initialize an empty list to store the final 6x6 output grids.
11. Iterate through the unique window corners `(r, c)` in the final (potentially reversed) order:
    a.  Extract the 6x6 subgrid from the input grid starting at row `r` and column `c`. Ensure extraction is within the bounds of the input grid.
    b.  Create a cleaned copy of this 6x6 subgrid. Iterate through each pixel of the copied subgrid. If a pixel's color is one of the noise colors (5, 7, or 9), change its color to the background color identified in step 1.
    c.  Append the cleaned 6x6 subgrid to the list initialized in step 10.
12. Vertically stack all the cleaned 6x6 subgrids in the list to form the final output grid. If no valid window corners were found, the output is an empty grid.
