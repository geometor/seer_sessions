            "text": "**Perception of the Task Elements**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** The input is a larger grid, and the output is a taller, narrower grid composed of vertically stacked smaller grids.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant background color (Red, Green, Yellow, Azure in the examples). This background color is preserved in the output grid's background areas.\n3.  **Objects/Shapes:** Embedded within the input grid's background are distinct geometric shapes made of various colors (Yellow, Azure, Green, Blue, Red). These shapes appear to be the primary focus. Based on the output dimensions, these shapes seem to occupy a 6x6 bounding box.\n4.  **Noise Pixels:** Some input grids contain scattered pixels of specific colors (Gray=5, Orange=7, Maroon=9 - although Maroon=9 isn't seen in these examples). These pixels are not part of the main shapes and do not appear in the final output grid; they seem to be noise or potentially control signals. Gray pixels appear frequently but are removed. Orange pixels appear only in `train_3`.\n5.  **Transformation Goal:** The task seems to be about identifying specific shapes (those fitting a 6x6 bounding box) in the input, extracting them, cleaning them (removing noise pixels within their bounds), and arranging them vertically in the output.\n6.  **Extraction:** Each relevant shape from the input corresponds to one 6x6 grid in the output. The extraction seems based on the shape's 6x6 bounding box.\n7.  **Cleaning:** Any 'noise' pixels (Gray=5, Orange=7) found within the extracted 6x6 bounding box of a shape are replaced with the input grid's background color.\n8.  **Ordering:** The extracted and cleaned 6x6 shapes are stacked vertically. The order appears to be determined by the top-to-bottom, then left-to-right position of the shape's bounding box in the input grid. However, in `train_3`, where Orange(7) pixels are present in the input, this order is reversed.\n\n**YAML Facts Block**\n\n"
