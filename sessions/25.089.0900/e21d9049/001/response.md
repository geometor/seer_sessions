"""
Identify the unique intersection point of a horizontal and a vertical sequence of non-background colors in the input grid. 
Extract these two color sequences (H for horizontal, V for vertical).
Compare the sequences H and V.
If H and V are identical, the pattern P for tiling the intersection row is H, and the pattern Q for tiling the intersection column is V cyclically shifted left by one position.
If H and V are different, the pattern P is H cyclically shifted left by one position, and the pattern Q is V itself.
Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initialized with the background color (white, 0).
Tile the entire intersection row in the output grid using the repeating pattern P.
Tile the entire intersection column in the output grid using the repeating pattern Q.
The cell at the intersection will be correctly colored by both tiling operations.
