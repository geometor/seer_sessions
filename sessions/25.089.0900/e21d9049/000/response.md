*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input grids contain a single connected object composed of different colored pixels (non-white) on a white background.
    *   This object generally forms a shape where a horizontal segment and a vertical segment of pixels intersect.
    *   The output grids are largely white, except for one specific row and one specific column.
    *   The row that is filled in the output corresponds to the row of the horizontal segment in the input object.
    *   The column that is filled in the output corresponds to the column of the vertical segment in the input object.
    *   The filled row and column in the output consist of repeating sequences of colors.
    *   These repeating color sequences are derived from the color sequences of the horizontal and vertical segments found in the input object.
    *   One of the input sequences (either horizontal or vertical) appears to be cyclically shifted by one position before being used as the repeating pattern in the output, while the other is used directly. The choice of which sequence to shift depends on whether the horizontal and vertical input sequences are identical.

    task_description: Identify intersecting horizontal and vertical color sequences in the input grid and use them (potentially with a cyclic shift) to tile the corresponding row and column in the output grid.

        properties:
          - derived_from: Input Grid
          - type: list of colors
          - definition: The sequence of colors along the maximal vertical contiguous non-white segment involved in the intersection.

      - object: Output Grid Pattern - Horizontal (P)
        properties:
          - derived_from: H or V
          - type: list of colors (repeating pattern)
          - generation_rule: Either H directly, or H cyclically shifted left by 1.
      - object: Output Grid Pattern - Vertical (Q)
        properties:
          - derived_from: H or V
          - type: list of colors (repeating pattern)
          - generation_rule: Either V directly, or V cyclically shifted left by 1.
      - object: Output Grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array of integers (colors)
          - dimensions: same as Input Grid
          - background_color: white (0)
          - content: Intersection row `r` filled with pattern P, intersection column `c` filled with pattern Q.

    relationships:
      - H and V intersect at the Intersection Point (r, c).
      - The generation of P and Q depends on whether H == V.
        - If H == V: P = H, Q = shift_left(V)
        - If H != V: P = shift_left(H), Q = V
      - Output Grid's row `r` is tiled using pattern P.
      - Output Grid's column `c` is tiled using pattern Q.
      - The value at Output Grid `(r, c)` is determined by both tiling operations (which consistently yield the same value based on the examples).

    actions:
      - Find the intersection point (r, c).
      - Extract the horizontal color sequence H passing through (r, c).
      - Extract the vertical color sequence V passing through (r, c).
      - Compare sequences H and V.
      - Determine patterns P and Q based on the comparison (applying shift if necessary).
      - Create a new grid of the same size, filled with white.
      - Tile row `r` of the new grid with pattern P.
      - Tile column `c` of the new grid with pattern Q.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the single connected non-white object in the input grid.
    2.  Find the unique pixel `(r, c)` which is part of both the longest contiguous horizontal sequence of non-white pixels and the longest contiguous vertical sequence of non-white pixels within the object.
    3.  Extract the full sequence of colors along this horizontal segment; call this sequence `H`. Let its length be `len(H)`.
    4.  Extract the full sequence of colors along this vertical segment; call this sequence `V`. Let its length be `len(V)`.
    5.  Compare the sequences `H` and `V`.
    6.  If `H` is identical to `V`:
        *   Define the horizontal repeating pattern `P` as `H` itself.
        *   Define the vertical repeating pattern `Q` by cyclically shifting `V` one position to the left (e.g., `[v1, v2, ..., vn]` becomes `[v2, ..., vn, v1]`).
    7.  If `H` is *not* identical to `V`:
        *   Define the horizontal repeating pattern `P` by cyclically shifting `H` one position to the left.
        *   Define the vertical repeating pattern `Q` as `V` itself.
    8.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
    9.  Fill the entire row `r` (the intersection row) of the output grid by repeating the pattern `P`. For each column `j` in row `r`, the color is `P[j % len(P)]`.
    10. Fill the entire column `c` (the intersection column) of the output grid by repeating the pattern `Q`. For each row `i` in column `c`, the color is `Q[i % len(Q)]`. (Note: The cell `(r, c)` will be written twice, once by the row fill and once by the column fill; the rules ensure the value is consistent).
