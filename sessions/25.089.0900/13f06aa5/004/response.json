            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempt correctly identified the core concept of \"contained pixels\" and the idea of projecting their color onto an edge. However, it misinterpreted two key aspects:\n1.  **Projection Action:** The code placed only a single pixel on the target edge. The examples clearly show that the *entire* target edge is filled with the projected color, except possibly at corners where different edge fills intersect.\n2.  **Contained Pixel Fate:** The code incorrectly replaced the contained pixel with the background color. The examples show the contained pixel remains unchanged in its original position.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the definition of a \"contained pixel\" using the examples.\n2.  Confirm the edge-filling behavior for each projection color (Blue/Green -> Top, Red -> Left, Azure -> Right, Magenta -> Bottom).\n3.  Confirm the special column-filling rule for Magenta.\n4.  Confirm the corner-filling rule (White) for intersecting edge fills.\n5.  Re-implement the logic based on these refined rules, ensuring the original contained pixel is untouched and projections fill entire edges.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's re-run the contained pixel detection logic from the previous attempt (without the transformations) to confirm the triggers.\n"

The condition \"completely surrounded by 8 pixels of *another* color C2\" seems incorrect or incomplete based on the examples.\n\nLet's re-examine the inputs and outputs visually:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Blue(1) at (3,9) is surrounded by Yellow(4). Azure(8) at (8,2) is surrounded by Yellow(4). The background is Red(2). Yellow(4) is not the background.\n    *   Output: Top edge filled with Blue(1), Right edge filled with Azure(8). Corner (0,13) is White(0). The original Blue(1) and Azure(8) pixels *remain* in the output! My previous code replaced them. The yellow surrounding pixels also remain.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Green(3) at (3,9) surrounded by Azure(8). Red(2) at (5,3) surrounded by Azure(8). Background is Blue(1). Azure(8) is not the background.\n    *   Output: Top edge filled with Green(3). Left edge filled with Red(2). Corner (0,0) is White(0). Original Green(3) and Red(2) remain. Surrounding Azure(8) pixels remain.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Magenta(6) at (2,5) surrounded by Blue(1). Background is Green(3). Blue(1) is not the background.\n    *   Output: Bottom edge filled with Magenta(6). Magenta(6) placed at (4,5), (6,5), (8,5), (10,5), (12,5). Original Magenta(6) at (2,5) remains. Surrounding Blue(1) pixels remain.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe trigger is indeed a pixel (`C1` at `(r, c)`) completely surrounded by 8 pixels of a single, different color (`C2`), where `C2` is *not* the background color. My detection code must have had a bug. Let's retry the detection logic carefully.\n\nThe transformation is:\n1.  Identify all such \"contained pixels\" (`C1`, `r`, `c`) and their surrounding color `C2`.\n2.  Keep the input grid entirely intact initially for the output.\n3.  Determine the target edge based on `C1`.\n4.  Fill the *entire* target edge with color `C1`.\n5.  Apply the special Magenta column fill rule if `C1` is Magenta(6).\n6.  Check for edge intersections and set corners to White(0).\n7.  The original `C1` pixel and the surrounding `C2` pixels are *not* explicitly changed by steps 1-6; they only change if overwritten by an edge fill or a corner fill.\n\nLet's retry the detection logic more carefully within the tool.\n"

            "text": "**Further Analysis:**\n\nThe corrected detection logic *still* doesn't find the contained pixels. This is very strange. Let's manually check the conditions for Example 1's Blue(1) pixel at (3, 9):\n*   `C1 = grid[3, 9] = 1` (Blue)\n*   `Background = 2` (Red)\n*   `C1 != Background` (True: 1 != 2)\n*   Neighbors: `grid[2,8]=2`, `grid[2,9]=2`, `grid[2,10]=2`, `grid[3,8]=4`, `grid[3,10]=4`, `grid[4,8]=2`, `grid[4,9]=4`, `grid[4,10]=4`\n*   The neighbors are *not* all the same color. My assumption about \"8 neighbors of a single color C2\" was wrong.\n\nLet's rethink the \"contained pixel\" definition based on the visual structure.\nIt looks like the trigger pixel (C1) is *adjacent* to an \"object\" (C2), and this object largely surrounds it, separating it from the background. It doesn't require *all 8* neighbors to be C2.\n\nMaybe the rule is: Find a non-background pixel `C1` at `(r, c)` such that *at least one* neighbor has color `C2` (where `C2` is also not the background color and `C1 != C2`), and there is *no path* from `(r, c)` to the grid boundary consisting only of pixels with color `C1` or the background color. This sounds like a \"flood fill\" or \"region containment\" concept.\n\nLet's simplify: Could the trigger be just the *color* C1 that is adjacent to C2?\n*   Ex1: Blue(1) is adjacent to Yellow(4). Azure(8) is adjacent to Yellow(4). Background Red(2).\n*   Ex2: Green(3) is adjacent to Azure(8). Red(2) is adjacent to Azure(8). Background Blue(1).\n*   Ex3: Magenta(6) is adjacent to Blue(1). Background Green(3).\n\nThis seems too simple. Why *those specific* pixels? Why the Blue(1) at (3,9) and not the other adjacent Blue/Yellow pixels? Why the Azure(8) at (8,2) and not others?\n\nWhat if it's the *innermost* pixel of color C1 within a C2 structure?\n*   Ex1: The Blue(1) at (3,9) is the only Blue pixel. The Azure(8) at (8,2) is the only Azure pixel. Both are adjacent to Yellow(4).\n*   Ex2: The Green(3) at (3,9) is the only Green pixel. The Red(2) at (5,3) is the only Red pixel. Both are adjacent to Azure(8).\n*   Ex3: The Magenta(6) at (2,5) is the only Magenta pixel. It's adjacent to Blue(1).\n\nThis looks much more promising! The trigger is a pixel whose color `C1` appears *only once* in the entire grid, is *not* the background color, and is adjacent (sharing an edge or corner) to *at least one* pixel of *another* non-background color `C2`.\n\n**Final Refined Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Find Trigger Pixels:** Identify all pixels `(r, c)` with color `C1` such that:\n    *   `C1` is not the background color.\n    *   The count of pixels with color `C1` in the entire grid is exactly 1.\n    *   (Optional check, maybe redundant): It has at least one neighbor `(nr, nc)` whose color `C2` is not `C1` and not the background color.\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n3.  **Process Triggers:** For each trigger pixel (`C1`, `r`, `c`) found:\n    *   Determine the target edge based on `C1`:\n        *   Blue(1) or Green(3): Top edge (row 0)\n        *   Red(2): Left edge (column 0)\n        *   Azure(8): Right edge (column `width-1`)\n        *   Magenta(6): Bottom edge (row `height-1`)\n    *   Fill the *entire* target edge in the output grid with color `C1`. Record which edges were filled.\n    *   If `C1` is Magenta(6): Perform the additional action of filling pixels in column `c` at rows `r+2, r+4, ...` up to `height-2` with Magenta(6).\n4.  **Handle Corners:** After processing all triggers, check for edge intersections based on the recorded filled edges:\n    *   If Top and Left edges were filled, set `output_grid[0, 0] = 0` (White).\n    *   If Top and Right edges were filled, set `output_grid[0, width-1] = 0` (White).\n5.  **Result:** The final state of the output grid.\n\nThis hypothesis matches all examples and observations.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
