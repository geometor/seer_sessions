task_description: Identify unique non-background pixels (triggers), and based on the trigger color, fill a corresponding edge of the grid with that color. Apply special rules for Magenta triggers and handle corner intersections.

definitions:
  background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  trigger_pixel: A pixel at (r, c) with color C1 that satisfies the following:
    - C1 is not the background_color.
    - The total count of pixels with color C1 in the input grid is exactly 1.
  target_edge: The specific boundary row or column determined by the trigger_pixel's color C1.
    - Blue (1): Top edge (row 0)
    - Green (3): Top edge (row 0)
    - Red (2): Left edge (column 0)
    - Azure (8): Right edge (column width-1)
    - Magenta (6): Bottom edge (row height-1)

transformations:
  - operation: initialize_output
    description: Create the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
  - operation: find_triggers
    description: Identify all trigger_pixels (C1, r, c) in the input grid.
  - operation: process_triggers
    description: For each trigger pixel (C1, r, c) found:
      - action: fill_edge
        target: The target_edge corresponding to C1.
        color: C1
        effect: Sets all pixels on the target_edge to C1 in the output grid.
        record_filled_edge: Keep track of which edges (Top, Left, Right, Bottom) have been filled.
      - action: magenta_special_rule (conditional)
        condition: C1 is Magenta (6).
        effect: In the output grid, set pixels at (r+2, c), (r+4, c), ..., up to row (height-2) inclusive, to Magenta (6).
  - operation: handle_intersections
    description: After processing all triggers, modify corner pixels based on recorded filled edges.
    rules:
      - condition: Top edge AND Left edge were filled.
        action: Set pixel (0, 0) to White (0).
      - condition: Top edge AND Right edge were filled.
        action: Set pixel (0, width-1) to White (0).
        
unchanged_elements:
  - All pixels from the input grid remain in the output grid unless they are on a target_edge that gets filled, are part of the Magenta special rule column fill, or are a corner pixel modified due to intersection handling. The trigger_pixel itself is only modified if it happens to lie on an edge/corner being overwritten.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
