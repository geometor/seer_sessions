            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of colored pixels. The size of the grid remains the same between input and output.\n2.  **Background Color:** Each input grid has a dominant background color (Red in Ex1, Blue in Ex2, Green in Ex3). This background color plays a role in the transformation.\n3.  **Objects:** There are distinct objects made of colors different from the background. Some objects fully enclose a pixel of another color.\n    *   Example 1: Yellow (4) objects enclose Blue (1) and Azure (8). Background is Red (2).\n    *   Example 2: Azure (8) objects enclose Green (3) and Red (2). Background is Blue (1).\n    *   Example 3: A Blue (1) object encloses Magenta (6). Background is Green (3).\n4.  **Key Feature:** The core transformation seems triggered by these \"contained\" pixels \u2013 single pixels completely surrounded by another color, which is itself distinct from the background.\n5.  **Transformation Actions:**\n    *   The contained pixel is removed (replaced by the background color).\n    *   The color of the contained pixel (let's call it C1) is projected onto one of the grid's outer edges.\n    *   The specific edge depends on the color C1: Blue(1)/Green(3) -> Top, Red(2) -> Left, Azure(8) -> Right, Magenta(6) -> Bottom.\n    *   The position on the edge depends on the original position of C1: for Top/Bottom edges, the projection appears in the same column; for Left/Right edges, it appears in the same row.\n    *   If two contained pixels exist and their projections land on intersecting edges (e.g., Top and Left, or Top and Right), the corner pixel at the intersection becomes White (0).\n    *   The Magenta (6) case has an additional effect: the entire target edge row (Bottom) is filled with Magenta, and Magenta pixels are placed periodically down the original column below the original contained pixel's location.\n    *   The containing object (color C2) and other parts of the grid remain unchanged unless overwritten by a projection or the background color fill.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"

Determine the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid.\n3.  Scan the input grid to locate all 'contained pixels'. A pixel at coordinates (`r`, `c`) with color `C1` is considered 'contained' if all eight of its immediate neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) have the same color `C2`, where `C2` is different from the background color. Record the color `C1`, row `r`, and column `c` for each contained pixel found.\n4.  Create a list to store details of the projections to be made later (color, target row, target column).\n5.  Iterate through the recorded contained pixels (`C1`, `r`, `c`):\n    a.  In the output grid, change the color of the pixel at (`r`, `c`) to the background color.\n    b.  Based on the color `C1`:\n        i.  If `C1` is Blue (1) or Green (3), add projection details (`C1`, 0, `c`) to the list.\n        ii. If `C1` is Red (2), add projection details (`C1`, `r`, 0) to the list.\n        iii.If `C1` is Azure (8), add projection details (`C1`, `r`, grid\\_width - 1) to the list.\n        iv. If `C1` is Magenta (6):\n            1.  Fill the *entire* bottom row (row `grid_height - 1`) of the output grid with Magenta (6).\n            2.  Starting from row `r + 2`, proceeding downwards in steps of 2, change the color of pixels in column `c` to Magenta (6), stopping at or before row `grid_height - 1`. (Effectively, fill (r+2, c), (r+4, c), ... as long as the row index is less than `grid_height - 1`).\n            3.  (Note: The specific pixel (height-1, c) will also be set by the row fill).\n6.  Apply the standard projections: Iterate through the projection list created in step 4. For each entry (`Color`, `TargetRow`, `TargetCol`), set the pixel at (`TargetRow`, `TargetCol`) in the output grid to `Color`.\n7.  Check for and resolve corner intersections caused by projections:\n    a.  If projections placed colors on both the Top edge (row 0) and the Left edge (column 0), set the pixel at (0, 0) to White (0).\n    b.  If projections placed colors on both the Top edge (row 0) and the Right edge (column `grid_width - 1`), set the pixel at (0, `grid_width - 1`) to White (0).\n8.  The final state of the output grid is the result."
