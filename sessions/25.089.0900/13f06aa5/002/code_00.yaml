task_description: Identify isolated pixels (triggers), replace them with the background color, and project their original color onto a grid edge based on the color. Handle special rules for Magenta projections and corner intersections.

definitions:
  background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid.
  trigger_pixel:
    description: A pixel at (r, c) with color C1 that meets two conditions:
      1. C1 is not the background_color.
      2. None of the 8 neighboring pixels (if they exist within grid bounds) have the color C1.
    properties:
      color: C1
      location: (r, c)

transformations:
  - operation: setup
    action: Copy the input grid to create the output grid.
    action: Determine the background_color.
  - operation: find_triggers
    action: Identify all trigger_pixels using the definition above. Store their color C1, row r, and column c.
  - operation: process_triggers
    description: For each trigger pixel (C1, r, c) found:
      - action: replace_pixel
        target: output grid location (r, c)
        new_color: background_color
      - action: determine_projection_or_special_action
        based_on: C1
        rules:
          - color: Blue (1)
            effect: Standard projection
            target_edge: Top row (row 0)
            target_coord: (0, c)
            projected_color: Blue (1)
          - color: Red (2)
            effect: Standard projection
            target_edge: Left column (col 0)
            target_coord: (r, 0)
            projected_color: Red (2)
          - color: Green (3)
            effect: Standard projection
            target_edge: Top row (row 0)
            target_coord: (0, c)
            projected_color: Green (3)
          - color: Azure (8)
            effect: Standard projection
            target_edge: Right column (col width-1)
            target_coord: (r, width-1)
            projected_color: Azure (8)
          - color: Magenta (6)
            effect: Special action (applied immediately to output grid)
            actions:
              - fill_row:
                  row_index: height-1
                  color: Magenta (6)
              - place_pixels_periodically:
                  column_index: c
                  start_row: r + 2 # Row below the original trigger's row + 1
                  step: 2
                  end_row_exclusive: height - 1 # Stop before the last row
                  color: Magenta (6)
  - operation: apply_standard_projections
    description: After processing all triggers, apply the standard projections determined in the previous step.
    action: For each standard projection (Color, TargetRow, TargetCol), set the pixel at (TargetRow, TargetCol) in the output grid to Color. Keep track of which edges (Top, Left, Right) received projections.
  - operation: handle_intersections
    description: Resolve conflicts at corners if standard projections landed on intersecting edges.
    action: If both Top and Left edges received projections, set output_grid[0, 0] to White (0).
    action: If both Top and Right edges received projections, set output_grid[0, width-1] to White (0).

unchanged_elements:
  - All pixels not identified as trigger_pixels and not modified by projections or special actions retain their original color from the input grid.

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: Input and output grids have the same height and width.
