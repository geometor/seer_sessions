The input grids primarily consist of an azure (8) background, with scattered pixels of other colors, notably blue (1), magenta (6), and orange (7). The transformation rule focuses specifically on the interaction between blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels when they are vertically adjacent. Orange (7) and azure (8) pixels appear unaffected and act as background or static elements. The core operation is a conditional positional swap between vertically adjacent magenta and blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
