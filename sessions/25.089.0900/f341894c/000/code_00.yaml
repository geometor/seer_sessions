task_elements:
  - grid_dimensions: Variable (e.g., 10x10, 8x8, 14x14)
  - background_color: azure (8)
  - relevant_colors:
      - blue (1)
      - magenta (6)
  - static_colors:
      - orange (7)
      - azure (8)
  - key_relationship: Vertical adjacency
  - condition: A magenta (6) pixel is located directly above a blue (1) pixel.
  - action: If the condition is met, swap the positions (colors) of the magenta (6) and blue (1) pixels.
  - constraints:
      - Only applies to vertical adjacency (not horizontal or diagonal).
      - Only applies when magenta (6) is above blue (1).
      - Swaps happen in pairs; isolated blue or magenta pixels are not affected unless they form the specific vertical pair.
      - Other colors (orange, azure) are unchanged.
