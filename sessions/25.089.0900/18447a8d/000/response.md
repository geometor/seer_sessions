**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are composed of pixels with colors 0-9. Orange (7) serves as the primary background color and also forms horizontal dividing lines.
2.  **Horizontal Bands:** The grids are segmented into horizontal bands by rows consisting entirely of the orange (7) background color.
3.  **Marker Objects:** Within each band, on the left side, there is an "L-shaped" or line-like object composed of azure (8) pixels. These markers remain unchanged between input and output. Their rightmost extent defines a boundary.
4.  **Payload Objects:** Within each band, on the right side of the *input* grid, there is a rectangular block of a single color (neither orange 7 nor azure 8). These are the "payload" objects.
5.  **Transformation - Movement:** In the output grid, each payload object is moved from its position on the right to a position on the left. The moved object is placed immediately to the right of the azure (8) marker object within the same horizontal band.
6.  **Transformation - Color Change:** The color of the payload object *may* change during the move. This change depends on the specific *set* of unique payload colors present across *all* bands in the input grid.
    *   If the input colors are {Maroon (9), Green (3), Blue (1)}, the mapping is 9->1, 3->9, 1->3.
    *   If the input colors are {Maroon (9), Red (2)}, the mapping is 9->9, 2->2 (no change).
    *   If the input colors are {Red (2), Yellow (4), Green (3), Magenta (6)}, the mapping is 2->2, 4->
