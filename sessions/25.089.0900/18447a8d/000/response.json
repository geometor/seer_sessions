Orange (7) serves as the primary background color and also forms horizontal dividing lines.\n2.  **Horizontal Bands:** The grids are segmented into horizontal bands by rows consisting entirely of the orange (7) background color.\n3.  **Marker Objects:** Within each band, on the left side, there is an \"L-shaped\" or line-like object composed of azure (8) pixels. These markers remain unchanged between input and output. Their rightmost extent defines a boundary.\n4.  **Payload Objects:** Within each band, on the right side of the *input* grid, there is a rectangular block of a single color (neither orange 7 nor azure 8). These are the \"payload\" objects.\n5.  **Transformation - Movement:** In the output grid, each payload object is moved from its position on the right to a position on the left. The moved object is placed immediately to the right of the azure (8) marker object within the same horizontal band.\n6.  **Transformation - Color Change:** The color of the payload object *may* change during the move. This change depends on the specific *set* of unique payload colors present across *all* bands in the input grid.\n    *   If the input colors are {Maroon (9), Green (3), Blue (1)}, the mapping is 9->1, 3->9, 1->3.\n    *   If the input colors are {Maroon (9), Red (2)}, the mapping is 9->9, 2->2 (no change).\n    *   If the input colors are {Red (2), Yellow (4), Green (3), Magenta (6)}, the mapping is 2->2, 4->"
