The output grids are modifications of the input grids where the 'azure' segments are extended downwards. The extension seems to originate from below the existing 'azure' segments in specific columns and continues towards the bottom of the grid, potentially interacting with or being limited by the 'red' object, although closer inspection reveals the extension goes all the way down regardless of the red object, only changing white pixels.\n\n*   **Facts YAML:**\n    "
