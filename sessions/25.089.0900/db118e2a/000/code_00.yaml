task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_size: variable (height H, width W)
    - output_size: fixed (15x15)
    - background_color: orange (7)
    - border: Input grid typically has a 1-pixel wide border of the background color.
  objects:
    - name: inner_pattern
      description: The central part of the input grid, obtained by removing the outermost 1-pixel border.
      properties:
        - source: Input grid coordinates from (1, 1) to (H-2, W-2).
        - size: (H-2) x (W-2)
        - content: Varies per example, includes colors other than the background.
  actions:
    - name: initialize_output
      description: Create a 15x15 grid filled entirely with the background color (orange 7).
    - name: extract_pattern
      description: Identify and isolate the 'inner_pattern' from the input grid.
    - name: place_copy_1
      description: Copy the 'inner_pattern' onto the output grid.
      target_location: Top-left corner at (row=2, column=2).
    - name: place_copy_2
      description: Copy the 'inner_pattern' onto the output grid again.
      target_location: Top-left corner at (row=8, column=8).
  relationships:
    - The output grid's content is determined by the input grid's 'inner_pattern' and the fixed placement rules.
    - The two copies placed on the output grid are identical to the 'inner_pattern'.
