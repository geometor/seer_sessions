**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** The task takes an input grid of variable size and produces a fixed-size output grid (15x15).
2.  **Background Color:** Both input and output grids predominantly use orange (7) as a background or border color.
3.  **Core Pattern:** The input grids contain a central pattern surrounded by a single-pixel orange border. This central pattern consists of various colors.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the central pattern within the input grid (by removing the 1-pixel orange border) and duplicating this pattern twice onto the larger output grid.
5.  **Placement:** The two copies of the central pattern are placed at specific, fixed locations within the 15x15 output grid:
    *   The first copy's top-left corner is placed at row 2, column 2 (using 0-based indexing).
    *   The second copy's top-left corner is placed at row 8, column 8 (using 0-based indexing).
6.  **Output Background:** The remaining area of the 15x15 output grid, not covered by the two pattern copies, is filled with the orange (7) color.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_properties:
    - input_size: variable (height H, width W)
    - output_size: fixed (15x15)
    - background_color: orange (7)
    - border: Input grid typically has a 1-pixel wide border of the background color.
  objects:
    - name: inner_pattern
      description: The central part of the input grid, obtained by removing the outermost 1-pixel border.
      properties:
        - source: Input grid coordinates from (1, 1) to (H-2, W-2).
        - size: (H-2) x (W-2)
        - content: Varies per example, includes colors other than the background.
  actions:
    - name: initialize_output
      description: Create a 15x15 grid filled entirely with the background color (orange 7).
    - name: extract_pattern
      description: Identify and isolate the 'inner_pattern' from the input grid.
    - name: place_copy_1
      description: Copy the 'inner_pattern' onto the output grid.
      target_location: Top-left corner at (row=2, column=2).
    - name: place_copy_2
      description: Copy the 'inner_pattern' onto the output grid again.
      target_location: Top-left corner at (row=8, column=8).
  relationships:
    - The output grid's content is determined by the input grid's 'inner_pattern' and the fixed placement rules.
    - The two copies placed on the output grid are identical to the 'inner_pattern'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new 15x15 grid and fill it completely with the orange color (7). This will be the output grid.
2.  Identify the "inner pattern" from the input grid. This pattern is the subgrid formed by excluding the single outermost pixel layer from all four sides of the input grid. (Specifically, if the input grid has height H and width W, the inner pattern spans from row index 1 to H-2 and column index 1 to W-2).
3.  Copy the identified "inner pattern" onto the output grid, placing its top-left corner at output grid coordinates (row=2, column=2).
4.  Copy the same "inner pattern" again onto the output grid, this time placing its top-left corner at output grid coordinates (row=8, column=8).
5.  The resulting 15x15 grid is the final output.
