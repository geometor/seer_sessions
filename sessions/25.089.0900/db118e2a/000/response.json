This central pattern consists of various colors.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying the central pattern within the input grid (by removing the 1-pixel orange border) and duplicating this pattern twice onto the larger output grid.\n5.  **Placement:** The two copies of the central pattern are placed at specific, fixed locations within the 15x15 output grid:\n    *   The first copy's top-left corner is placed at row 2, column 2 (using 0-based indexing).\n    *   The second copy's top-left corner is placed at row 8, column 8 (using 0-based indexing).\n6.  **Output Background:** The remaining area of the 15x15 output grid, not covered by the two pattern copies, is filled with the orange (7) color.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the \"inner pattern\" from the input grid. This pattern is the subgrid formed by excluding the single outermost pixel layer from all four sides of the input grid. (Specifically, if the input grid has height H and width W, the inner pattern spans from row index 1 to H-2 and column index 1 to W-2).\n3.  Copy the identified \"inner pattern\" onto the output grid, placing its top-left corner at output grid coordinates (row=2, column=2).\n4.
