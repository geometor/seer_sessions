            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    *   The input grid contains a white background, two distinct vertical red lines (color 2) usually near the left and right edges, and several azure pixels (color 8) scattered between the red lines.\n    *   The output grid retains the original red lines. New horizontal lines appear, primarily composed of azure (8) pixels, with some yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   The azure pixels in the input act as markers or triggers. They are located on rows that are part of one of the red vertical line segments.\n    *   Each input azure pixel seems to generate two horizontal lines in the output:\n        1.  A line on the *same row* as the input azure pixel. This line starts from the red line on the same side as the azure pixel and extends towards the column of the azure pixel. The pixel at the azure pixel's original coordinates becomes yellow (4), and the pixels between the red line and the yellow pixel become azure (8).\n        2.  A line on the *corresponding row* of the *opposite* red line segment. This line starts from the opposite red line and extends fully across the gap towards the first red line, filling the space between the two red lines (exclusive) with azure (8) pixels.\n    *   The \"corresponding row\" is determined by the relative position within the red line segment. For example, if an azure pixel is on the 2nd row of the left red segment, the corresponding row on the right segment is the 2nd row of that segment.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but remove all azure (8) pixels from the copy, reverting them to white (0).\n    2.  Identify the two vertical red (2) line segments. Record their column indices (`col_left`, `col_right`) and their starting and ending row indices (`row_start_left`, `row_end_left`, `row_start_right`, `row_end_right`).\n    3.  Find all azure (8) pixels in the *original input* grid.\n    4.  For each found azure pixel at input coordinates (`r`, `c`):\n        a.  **Determine Source/Target:** Check if row `r` falls within the range [`row_start_left`, `row_end_left`].\n            *   If yes, the left segment is the 'source' and the right is the 'target'. Set `source_col = col_left`, `target_col = col_right`, `source_row_start = row_start_left`, `target_row_start = row_start_right`.\n            *   If no (meaning `r` is in the right segment's range), the right segment is the 'source' and the left is the 'target'. Set `source_col = col_right`, `target_col = col_left`, `source_row_start = row_start_right`, `target_row_start = row_start_left`.\n        b.  **Generate Same-Side Line:**\n            *   Place a yellow (4) pixel in the output grid at (`r`, `c`).\n            *   Determine the range of columns to fill with azure (8):\n                *   If source is left (`source_col = col_left`), fill columns from `col_left + 1` to `c - 1` in row `r` with azure (8).\n                *   If source is right (`source_col = col_right`), fill columns from `c + 1` to `col_right - 1` in row `r` with azure (8).\n        c.  **Generate Opposite-Side Line:**\n            *   Calculate the relative row index within the source segment: `relative_row = r - source_row_start`.\n            *   Calculate the corresponding row index in the target segment: `r_target = target_row_start + relative_row`.\n            *   Determine the range of columns to fill with azure (8) in row `r_target`: Fill columns from `min(col_left, col_right) + 1` to `max(col_left, col_right) - 1` with azure (8).\n    5.
