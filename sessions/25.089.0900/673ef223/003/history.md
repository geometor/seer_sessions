*   **Perception:**
    *   The input grid contains a white background, two distinct vertical red lines (color 2) usually near the left and right edges, and several azure pixels (color 8) scattered between the red lines.
    *   The output grid retains the original red lines. New horizontal lines appear, primarily composed of azure (8) pixels, with some yellow (4) pixels.
    *   The azure pixels in the input act as markers or triggers. They are located on rows that are part of one of the red vertical line segments.
    *   Each input azure pixel seems to generate two horizontal lines in the output:
        1.  A line on the *same row* as the input azure pixel. This line starts from the red line on the same side as the azure pixel and extends towards the column of the azure pixel. The pixel at the azure pixel's original coordinates becomes yellow (4), and the pixels between the red line and the yellow pixel become azure (8).
        2.  A line on the *corresponding row* of the *opposite* red line segment. This line starts from the opposite red line and extends fully across the gap towards the first red line, filling the space between the two red lines (exclusive) with azure (8) pixels.
    *   The "corresponding row" is determined by the relative position within the red line segment. For example, if an azure pixel is on the 2nd row of the left red segment, the corresponding row on the right segment is the 2nd row of that segment.

    actions:
      - identify: locate the two vertical red line segments and their row ranges.
      - identify: locate all azure marker pixels.
      - for_each: azure marker pixel at (r, c):
          - determine: which red segment (source) row 'r' belongs to, and identify the other segment (target).
          - generate_same_side:
              - draw: horizontal line in row 'r' starting adjacent to the source red line.
              - fill: with azure (8) pixels up to, but not including, column 'c'.
              - place: yellow (4) pixel at (r, c).
          - generate_opposite_side:
              - calculate: the corresponding row 'r_target' in the target segment's row range.
              - draw: horizontal line in row 'r_target' starting adjacent to the target red line.
              - fill: with azure (8) pixels across the entire width between the two red lines (exclusive of the columns containing the red lines).
      - copy: retain the original red lines in the output.
      - maintain: keep the background white where no lines are drawn.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but remove all azure (8) pixels from the copy, reverting them to white (0).
    2.  Identify the two vertical red (2) line segments. Record their column indices (`col_left`, `col_right`) and their starting and ending row indices (`row_start_left`, `row_end_left`, `row_start_right`, `row_end_right`).
    3.  Find all azure (8) pixels in the *original input* grid.
    4.  For each found azure pixel at input coordinates (`r`, `c`):
        a.  **Determine Source/Target:** Check if row `r` falls within the range [`row_start_left`, `row_end_left`].
            *   If yes, the left segment is the 'source' and the right is the 'target'. Set `source_col = col_left`, `target_col = col_right`, `source_row_start = row_start_left`, `target_row_start = row_start_right`.
            *   If no (meaning `r` is in the right segment's range), the right segment is the 'source' and the left is the 'target'. Set `source_col = col_right`, `target_col = col_left`, `source_row_start = row_start_right`, `target_row_start = row_start_left`.
        b.  **Generate Same-Side Line:**
            *   Place a yellow (4) pixel in the output grid at (`r`, `c`).
            *   Determine the range of columns to fill with azure (8):
                *   If source is left (`source_col = col_left`), fill columns from `col_left + 1` to `c - 1` in row `r` with azure (8).
                *   If source is right (`source_col = col_right`), fill columns from `c + 1` to `col_right - 1` in row `r` with azure (8).
        c.  **Generate Opposite-Side Line:**
            *   Calculate the relative row index within the source segment: `relative_row = r - source_row_start`.
            *   Calculate the corresponding row index in the target segment: `r_target = target_row_start + relative_row`.
            *   Determine the range of columns to fill with azure (8) in row `r_target`: Fill columns from `min(col_left, col_right) + 1` to `max(col_left, col_right) - 1` with azure (8).
    5.  The final output grid contains the original red lines and the newly generated yellow and azure pixels.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial code correctly identified the core components (red lines, azure markers) and the general transformation logic (generating two lines per marker). However, the execution results show consistent errors in the placement or extent of the "opposite side line" (the full horizontal line generated on the corresponding row of the target red segment). In all failed examples, the transformed output is missing azure (8) pixels where they are expected, specifically at the column corresponding to the *target* red line. This indicates the rule for drawing this line needs refinement; it appears the line should start *at* the target red line's column, overwriting it, rather than starting adjacent to it.

*   **Metrics:**
    Let's verify the locations and ranges for each example.

      - exists_on_row_corresponding_to_trigger_row_in_target_segment

actions:
  - identify: locate the two vertical red line segments and their row ranges.
  - identify: locate all azure marker pixels in the original input.
  - initialize: create output grid by copying input grid and removing azure markers (setting to white 0).
  - for_each: azure marker pixel at input coordinates (r, c):
      - determine: which red segment (source) row 'r' belongs to, and identify the other segment (target). Record source/target columns and row starts.
      - generate_same_side:
          - place: yellow (4) pixel at (r, c) in output.
          - draw: horizontal azure (8) line in row 'r' starting adjacent to the source red line column and ending just before column 'c'.
      - generate_opposite_side:
          - calculate: the corresponding row 'r_target' in the target segment's row range.
          - check: if 'r_target' is valid within the target segment's row range.
          - draw: horizontal azure (8) line in row 'r_target' starting *at* the target red line column and ending just before the source red line column. This overwrites the target red pixel at (r_target, target_col).
  - maintain: keep the original red lines (except where overwritten by opposite-side azure lines) and background white pixels.

```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but replace all azure (8) pixels in the copy with white (0) pixels.
    2.  Identify the two vertical red (2) line segments. For each segment, record its column index and the range of rows it spans (start row, end row). Let these be (`col_left`, `row_start_left`, `row_end_left`) and (`col_right`, `row_start_right`, `row_end_right`), assuming `col_left < col_right`.
    3.  Find the coordinates (`r`, `c`) of all azure (8) pixels in the *original input* grid.
    4.  For each found azure pixel at input coordinates (`r`, `c`):
        a.  **Determine Source/Target:** Check if the marker's row `r` falls within the row range of the left red segment ([`row_start_left`, `row_end_left`]).
            *   If yes: The left segment is the 'source'. Set `source_col = col_left`, `target_col = col_right`, `source_row_start = row_start_left`, `target_row_start = row_start_right`, `target_row_end = row_end_right`.
            *   If no (meaning `r` must be in the right segment's range [`row_start_right`, `row_end_right`]): The right segment is the 'source'. Set `source_col = col_right`, `target_col = col_left`, `source_row_start = row_start_right`, `target_row_start = row_start_left`, `target_row_end = row_end_left`.
        b.  **Generate Same-Side Segment:**
            *   Place a yellow (4) pixel in the output grid at (`r`, `c`).
            *   If the source is the left segment (`source_col == col_left`), fill the output grid cells from (`r`, `col_left + 1`) up to (`r`, `c - 1`) with azure (8).
            *   If the source is the right segment (`source_col == col_right`), fill the output grid cells from (`r`, `c + 1`) up to (`r`, `col_right - 1`) with azure (8).
        c.  **Generate Opposite-Side Line:**
            *   Calculate the relative row index within the source segment: `relative_row = r - source_row_start`.
            *   Calculate the potential corresponding row index in the target segment: `r_target = target_row_start + relative_row`.
            *   **Check Validity:** Proceed only if `r_target` is within the valid row range of the target segment (i.e., `target_row_start <= r_target <= target_row_end`).
            *   If valid, determine the column range for the full line: `fill_start = min(col_left, col_right)`, `fill_end = max(col_left, col_right)`.
            *   Fill the output grid cells in row `r_target` from column `fill_start` up to (but *not* including) column `fill_end` with azure (8). Note: This step implicitly assumes the line should fill between the columns *inclusive* of the target column and *exclusive* of the source column, based on the observed correction needed. Let's refine: fill from `target_col` (inclusive) to `source_col` (exclusive).
                *   If target is left (`target_col == col_left`): Fill columns `col_left` through `col_right - 1` in row `r_target` with azure (8).
                *   If target is right (`target_col == col_right`): Fill columns `col_left + 1` through `col_right` in row `r_target` with azure (8).
                *   *Correction based on analysis:* The fill should always span *between* the inner edges of the red lines, but also include the cell *at* the target red line's column.
                    *   Fill columns from `min(col_left, col_right) + 1` to `max(col_left, col_right) - 1` with azure (8).
                    *   Additionally, set the pixel at (`r_target`, `target_col`) to azure (8).
    5.  Return the modified output grid.
