Transformation Rule:

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, replacing all azure (8) pixels with white (0).
2.  Identify the two vertical red (2) line segments, recording their column indices (`col_left`, `col_right`) and their row spans (`row_start_left`, `row_end_left`, `row_start_right`, `row_end_right`).
3.  Find all azure (8) marker pixels in the original input grid.
4.  For each azure marker pixel at input coordinates (r, c):
    a. Determine which red line segment ('source') its row 'r' belongs to and identify the other segment ('target'). Note the source/target columns and row start/end indices.
    b. On the output grid, place a yellow (4) pixel at the marker's original coordinates (r, c).
    c. Draw a horizontal azure (8) line segment in row 'r' starting from the column adjacent to the source red line and extending up to (but not including) column 'c'.
    d. Calculate the corresponding row 'r_target' in the target red line segment based on the relative position of 'r' within the source segment.
    e. Check if 'r_target' falls within the row span of the target red line segment.
    f. If 'r_target' is valid, draw a horizontal azure (8) line segment in row 'r_target' that spans the columns strictly between the two red lines (i.e., from `min(col_left, col_right) + 1` to `max(col_left, col_right) - 1`).
    g. Additionally, set the pixel at (`r_target`, `target_col`) in the output grid to azure (8), overwriting the original red pixel at that location.
5.  The final output grid contains the modified red lines, the generated yellow markers, and the two types of generated azure horizontal lines.
