            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core mechanism: reflection across a blue axis line combined with color swapping. However, it failed because it only placed the *result* of the reflection, effectively deleting the original objects (or, more accurately, failing to reflect objects from the *other* side of the axis). The comparison between expected and transformed outputs clearly shows that the correct transformation involves reflecting objects *from above* the axis to *below*, *and* reflecting objects *from below* the axis to *above*. Both sets of reflected objects appear in the final output, along with the preserved blue axis line.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs, focusing on the source and destination of each non-axis object.\n2.  Confirm the bidirectional nature of the reflection. Objects originally above the line appear reflected below it in the output, and objects originally below appear reflected above.\n3.  Update the algorithm to perform two passes or a single pass that handles both reflection directions:\n    *   Identify the axis.\n    *   Initialize the output grid.\n    *   Copy the axis line pixels.\n    *   Iterate through input pixels:\n        *   If a pixel is above the axis (and not axis/background color), calculate its reflected position below, swap color, and place it on the output grid.\n        *   If a pixel is below the axis (and not axis/background color), calculate its reflected position above, swap color, and place it on the output grid.\n4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately describe this bidirectional reflection and color swap process.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 in detail to confirm the bidirectional reflection.\n\n*   **Input:** Blue line at column 6. Azure (8) and Yellow (4) objects are to the *right* of the line.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue line at column 6. The *original* Azure/Yellow objects appear reflected to the *left* of the line (with swapped colors: Azure->Yellow, Yellow->Azure). Additionally, the Azure/Yellow objects that were *originally* to the right also appear on the right, but with their colors swapped. This contradicts the initial assessment based on output images. Let me re-examine.\n\n*   **Re-assessment of Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Blue line (1) is vertical at index `c=6`. Objects (8, 4) are to the right (`c > 6`).\n    *   Expected Output: Blue line (1) is vertical at `c=6`. The *original* objects (8, 4) that were at `c>6` are now *gone* from the right side. Instead, their *reflected and color-swapped* versions appear on the *left* side (`c < 6`). Let's check the coordinates:\n        *   Input (2, 8) = 8 (Azure). Distance from axis (c=6) is 8-6 = +2. Reflected c = 6 - 2 = 4. Swapped color = 4 (Yellow). Expected Output (2, 4) = 4. **Incorrect, Expected Output (2, 8) = 4**. It seems the *original column* is used for the swapped color. Let's re-examine the expected output visually.\n\n    *   **Visual Re-check of Example 1:**\n        *   Input Object 1 (Azure, 8): (2,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10)\n        *   Input Object 2 (Yellow, 4): (3,10)\n        *   Axis: c=6\n        *   Expected Output Object 1 (Yellow, 4): (2,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10) -> **Wait, these are the original positions!** But the colors are swapped (8->4).\n        *   Expected Output Object 2 (Azure, 8): (3,10) -> **Original position!** Color swapped (4->8).\n        *   Expected Output also has new objects on the *left* side (`c<6`):\n            *   New Object 1 (Azure, 8): (2,4), (3,3?), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) -> Seems reflected shape of Input Object 1. Let's check reflection:\n                *   (2, 8) -> dist +2 -> reflect c = 6-2 = 4 -> (2, 4) color 8->4. **Output has 8 here.**\n                *   (3, 9) -> dist +3 -> reflect c = 6-3 = 3 -> (3, 3) color 8->4. **Output has 8 here.**\n                *   (4, 8) -> dist +2 -> reflect c = 6-2 = 4 -> (4, 4) color 8->4. **Output has 4 here.**\n                *   (4, 9) -> dist +3 -> reflect c = 6-3 = 3 -> (4, 3) color 8->4. **Output has 4 here.**\n                *   (4, 10) -> dist +4 -> reflect c = 6-4 = 2 -> (4, 2) color 8->4. **Output has 8 here.**\n            *   New Object 2 (Yellow, 4): (3, 2) -> Reflected shape of Input Object 2.\n                *   (3, 10) -> dist +4 -> reflect c = 6-4 = 2 -> (3, 2) color 4->8. **Output has 4 here.**\n\n    *   **Revised Hypothesis:** This is much more complex. It seems like:\n        1.  Find the axis (vertical in Ex1, horizontal in Ex2, Ex3).\n        2.  Identify objects on one side (e.g., right side in Ex1, above in Ex2, below in Ex3). Let's call this the \"source\" side. The other side is the \"target\" side.\n        3.  The objects on the source side *disappear* from the source side in the output.\n        4.  The *color-swapped versions* of the source objects appear in their *original positions* on the source side (e.g., Ex1 right side has swapped colors). **No, re-reading Ex1 Output, the right side is empty except for the axis.** My previous reading was wrong.\n        5.  The *reflected versions* of the source objects appear on the *target* side, but *their colors are also swapped*.\n\n    *   **Let's re-re-check Example 1:**\n        *   Input: Vertical axis c=6. Objects 8 & 4 are right (c>6). Left side (c<6) is empty.\n        *   Output: Vertical axis c=6. Right side (c>6) is empty. Left side (c<6) contains the *reflected* shapes, but with *swapped* colors.\n            *   Input (2, 8)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (2, 4). Swap 8->4. Output (2, 4)=4. **Match!**\n            *   Input (3, 9)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (3, 3). Swap 8->4. Output (3, 3)=4. **Match!**\n            *   Input (4, 8)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (4, 4). Swap 8->4. Output (4, 4)=4. **Match!**\n            *   Input (4, 9)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (4, 3). Swap 8->4. Output (4, 3)=4. **Match!**\n            *   Input (4, 10)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (4, 2). Swap 8->4. Output (4, 2)=4. **Match!**\n            *   Input (3, 10)=4 -> reflect across c=6 -> (3, 2). Swap 4->8. Output (3, 2)=8. **Match!**\n\n    *   **Let's check Example 2 with this new hypothesis:**\n        *   Input: Horizontal axis r=4. Objects 2 & 3 are above (r<4). Below (r>4) is empty.\n        *   Output: Horizontal axis r=4. Above (r<4) is empty. Below (r>4) contains *reflected* shapes with *swapped* colors.\n            *   Input (0, 3)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (8, 3). Swap 2->3. Output (8, 3)=3. **Match!**\n            *   Input (0, 5)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (8, 5). Swap 2->3. Output (8, 5)=3. **Match!**\n            *   Input (1, 2)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 2). Swap 2->3. Output (7, 2)=3. **Match!**\n            *   Input (1, 3)=3 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 3). Swap 3->2. Output (7, 3)=2. **Match!**\n            *   Input (1, 4)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 4). Swap 2->3. Output (7, 4)=3. **Match!**\n            *   Input (1, 5)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 5). Swap 2->3. Output (7, 5)=3. **Match!**\n            *   Input (2, 4)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (6, 4). Swap 2->3. Output (6, 4)=3. **Match!**\n\n    *   **Let's check Example 3:**\n        *   Input: Horizontal axis r=8. Objects 5 & 6 are below (r>8). Above (r<8) is empty.\n        *   Output: Horizontal axis r=8. Below (r>8) is empty. Above (r<8) contains *reflected* shapes with *swapped* colors.\n            *   Input (10, 2)=5 -> reflect across r=8 -> (6, 2). Swap 5->6. Output (6, 2)=6. **Match!**\n            *   Input (10, 3)=6 -> reflect across r=8 -> (6, 3). Swap 6->5. Output (6, 3)=5. **Match!**\n            *   ...and so on. This pattern holds.\n\n    *   **Final Confirmed Hypothesis:**\n        1.  Identify the axis (vertical or horizontal line containing blue (1) and maybe white (0) pixels, choosing the one with the most blue pixels).\n        2.  Identify all non-axis, non-background pixels. These constitute the \"source objects\". Note: All source objects appear only on *one* side of the axis in the examples.\n        3.  Create an empty output grid (all white/0).\n        4.  Copy only the blue (1) pixels from the axis line onto the output grid.\n        5.  For each pixel belonging to a source object:\n            a.  Calculate its reflected position across the axis.\n            b.  Determine the swapped color using the pairs (8<>4, 2<>3, 5<>6).\n            c.  Place the *swapped color* at the *reflected position* in the output grid.\n        6.  The original positions of the source objects remain empty (white/0) in the output grid because we start with an empty grid and only add the reflected, swapped pixels.\n\nThis matches the results from the code execution - the code *was* correctly reflecting and swapping, but my interpretation of the *expected* output was flawed initially. The code failed because the axis finding or reflection logic must have a subtle bug. Let's re-examine the code's logic vs the failed Example 1.\n\n*   Code `find_reflection_axis` correctly identifies axis `c=6` (vertical) for Ex1.\n*   Code initializes `output_np` to zeros.\n*   Code copies blue pixels from axis `c=6` to `output_np`. Correct.\n*   Code iterates through input `(r, c)`.\n*   Consider input pixel (2, 8) = 8.\n    *   `original_color = 8`. Not 0.\n    *   `axis_type = 'vertical'`, `c = 8`, `axis_idx = 6`. `c != axis_idx`. Condition `if axis_type == 'vertical' and c == axis_idx:` is false. Correct.\n    *   `reflected_r = r = 2`.\n    *   `reflected_c = (2 * axis_idx) - c = (2 * 6) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4`. Correct.\n    *   Bounds check: `0 <= 2 < 11` (True), `0 <= 4 < 12` (True). Correct.\n    *   `swapped_color = COLOR_SWAP_MAP[8] = 4`. Correct.\n    *   `output_np[reflected_r, reflected_c] = swapped_color` -> `output_np[2, 4] = 4`.\n*   Compare with `Transformed Output` from report for Ex1: `output[2, 4]` is indeed 4.\n*   Let's check another pixel: input (3, 10) = 4.\n    *   `original_color = 4`. Not 0.\n    *   `c = 10`. `c != axis_idx`. Skip check ok.\n    *   `reflected_r = r = 3`.\n    *   `reflected_c = (2 * 6) - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2`. Correct.\n    *   Bounds check: `0 <= 3 < 11` (True), `0 <= 2 < 12` (True). Correct.\n    *   `swapped_color = COLOR_SWAP_MAP[4] = 8`. Correct.\n    *   `output_np[reflected_r, reflected_c] = swapped_color` -> `output_np[3, 2] = 8`.\n*   Compare with `Transformed Output` from report for Ex1: `output[3, 2]` is indeed 8.\n\n**Conclusion from Re-analysis:** The code *seems* to be implementing the \"Final Confirmed Hypothesis\" correctly. Why did the comparison fail? Let's look at the *full* transformed output vs expected for Example 1 again.\n\nExpected:\n"

The discrepancy lies between the \"Transformed Output\" and the \"Expected Output\".\n\n*   Expected Output has objects on *both* sides of the axis.\n*   Transformed Output has objects *only* on the side opposite the original objects.\n\n**Where did the objects on the right side of the Expected Output come from?**\nLooking at Expected Output for Ex 1:\n*   Left side (`c<6`): has reflected & swapped shapes from input right side. (e.g., `output[2,4]=4`, `output[3,2]=8`)\n*   Right side (`c>6`): has *different* shapes.\n    *   `output[2,8]=4`, `output[2,10]=4`\n    *   `output[3,9]=4`, `output[3,11]=8`\n    *   `output[4,8]=4`, `output[4,9]=4`, `output[4,10]=4`\nThese shapes on the right side of the output do *not* correspond directly to the input shapes on the right side. Are they reflections of something else? There was nothing on the left side of the input. This implies a more complex rule than simple reflection.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"objectness\" prior. Maybe the transformation applies to the *bounding box* or some property *of the object* rather than pixel-by-pixel?\n\n**Hypothesis 3: Object-based Reflection + Color Swap**\n1. Find Axis.\n2. Find contiguous objects (non-axis, non-background) on one side (\"source side\").\n3. For each source object:\n    a. Determine its bounding box.\n    b. Reflect the bounding box across the axis to the \"target side\".\n    c. \"Stamp\" the object onto the target side, aligned with the reflected bounding box, BUT using the swapped color(s).\n    d.
