elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
  - type: line
    color: blue (1)
    orientation: horizontal
    role: separator & axis_of_reflection
    persistence: remains unchanged between input and output
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous block of non-white (0), non-blue (1) pixels.
    location: Located entirely above or entirely below the blue line in the input.
    properties:
      - color
      - shape
      - position_relative_to_blue_line
actions:
  - name: find_blue_line
    input: input_grid
    output: row_index_of_blue_line
  - name: identify_objects
    input: input_grid
    criteria: contiguous pixels not color 0 or 1
    output: list_of_objects (with their pixels, colors, locations)
  - name: reflect_and_swap_color
    input: object, blue_line_row_index
    process:
      - determine if object is above or below the blue line
      - calculate new row index for each pixel based on reflection across blue_line_row_index
      - swap color of each pixel based on predefined pairs
    output: reflected_object (with new locations and swapped colors)
  - name: construct_output_grid
    process:
      - start with a white grid of the same dimensions as the input
      - copy the blue line from the input to the output
      - place the reflected_and_swapped objects onto the output grid
color_swaps:
  - pair: [azure (8), yellow (4)]
  - pair: [red (2), green (3)]
  - pair: [gray (5), magenta (6)]
relationships:
  - input_object maps to reflected_output_object
  - pixel distance from blue line is preserved but mirrored
  - specific color pairs are mutually swapped during reflection
