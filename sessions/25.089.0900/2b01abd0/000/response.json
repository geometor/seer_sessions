This blue line remains unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a reflection across the horizontal blue line, combined with a color swap.\n4.  **Objects:** Objects are contiguous blocks of non-white (color 0) and non-blue (color 1) pixels. These objects exist either entirely above or entirely below the blue line in the input.\n5.  **Reflection Action:**\n    *   Objects *above* the blue line in the input are reflected *below* the blue line in the output. The reflection is symmetrical with respect to the blue line's row index.\n    *   Objects *below* the blue line in the input are reflected *above* the blue line in the output.\n    *   The original objects are removed from their initial positions in the output grid, leaving white pixels (color 0) behind, unless overwritten by a reflected object.\n6.  **Color Swapping:** During the reflection, specific pairs of colors are swapped:\n    *   Example 1: Azure (8) swaps with Yellow (4).\n    *   Example 2: Red (2) swaps with Green (3).\n    *   Example 3: Gray (5) swaps with Magenta (6).\n7.  **Symmetry:** The reflection preserves the shape and relative positions of the pixels within an object, but flips it vertically across the blue line. The distance of each pixel from the blue line remains the same but on the opposite side.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
