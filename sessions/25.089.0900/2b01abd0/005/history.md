**Perception:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with different colors.
2.  **Key Feature:** A prominent horizontal blue line (color 1) exists in all examples, dividing the grid into an upper and a lower section. This blue line remains unchanged in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a reflection across the horizontal blue line, combined with a color swap.
4.  **Objects:** Objects are contiguous blocks of non-white (color 0) and non-blue (color 1) pixels. These objects exist either entirely above or entirely below the blue line in the input.
5.  **Reflection Action:**
    *   Objects *above* the blue line in the input are reflected *below* the blue line in the output. The reflection is symmetrical with respect to the blue line's row index.
    *   Objects *below* the blue line in the input are reflected *above* the blue line in the output.
    *   The original objects are removed from their initial positions in the output grid, leaving white pixels (color 0) behind, unless overwritten by a reflected object.
6.  **Color Swapping:** During the reflection, specific pairs of colors are swapped:
    *   Example 1: Azure (8) swaps with Yellow (4).
    *   Example 2: Red (2) swaps with Green (3).
    *   Example 3: Gray (5) swaps with Magenta (6).
7.  **Symmetry:** The reflection preserves the shape and relative positions of the pixels within an object, but flips it vertically across the blue line. The distance of each pixel from the blue line remains the same but on the opposite side.

**YAML Facts:**

      - swap color of each pixel based on predefined pairs
    output: reflected_object (with new locations and swapped colors)
  - name: construct_output_grid
    process:
      - start with a white grid of the same dimensions as the input
      - copy the blue line from the input to the output
      - place the reflected_and_swapped objects onto the output grid
color_swaps:
  - pair: [azure (8), yellow (4)]
  - pair: [red (2), green (3)]
  - pair: [gray (5), magenta (6)]
relationships:
  - input_object maps to reflected_output_object
  - pixel distance from blue line is preserved but mirrored
  - specific color pairs are mutually swapped during reflection
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
2.  Identify the row index of the horizontal blue line (color 1) in the input grid.
3.  Copy the blue line from the input grid to the same row index in the output grid.
4.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
5.  If a pixel is *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1):
    a.  Determine its original row (`r_orig`) and column (`c`).
    b.  Determine its original color (`color_orig`).
    c.  Calculate the vertical distance (`dist`) from the pixel's row to the blue line's row (`blue_line_row`). `dist = r_orig - blue_line_row`.
    d.  Calculate the reflected row index (`r_refl`) by flipping the distance: `r_refl = blue_line_row - dist`.
    e.  Determine the swapped color (`color_swapped`) based on the original color:
        *   If `color_orig` is azure (8), `color_swapped` is yellow (4).
        *   If `color_orig` is yellow (4), `color_swapped` is azure (8).
        *   If `color_orig` is red (2), `color_swapped` is green (3).
        *   If `color_orig` is green (3), `color_swapped` is red (2).
        *   If `color_orig` is gray (5), `color_swapped` is magenta (6).
        *   If `color_orig` is magenta (6), `color_swapped` is gray (5).
        *   (Assume other colors, if any, remain unchanged, although none are present in examples).
    f.  Place the `color_swapped` pixel at the calculated reflected position (`r_refl`, `c`) in the output grid.
6.  Return the completed output grid.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the core mechanism: reflection across a blue axis line combined with color swapping. However, it failed because it only placed the *result* of the reflection, effectively deleting the original objects (or, more accurately, failing to reflect objects from the *other* side of the axis). The comparison between expected and transformed outputs clearly shows that the correct transformation involves reflecting objects *from above* the axis to *below*, *and* reflecting objects *from below* the axis to *above*. Both sets of reflected objects appear in the final output, along with the preserved blue axis line.

**Strategy:**

1.  Re-analyze the input-output pairs, focusing on the source and destination of each non-axis object.
2.  Confirm the bidirectional nature of the reflection. Objects originally above the line appear reflected below it in the output, and objects originally below appear reflected above.
3.  Update the algorithm to perform two passes or a single pass that handles both reflection directions:
    *   Identify the axis.
    *   Initialize the output grid.
    *   Copy the axis line pixels.
    *   Iterate through input pixels:
        *   If a pixel is above the axis (and not axis/background color), calculate its reflected position below, swap color, and place it on the output grid.
        *   If a pixel is below the axis (and not axis/background color), calculate its reflected position above, swap color, and place it on the output grid.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately describe this bidirectional reflection and color swap process.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's analyze Example 1 in detail to confirm the bidirectional reflection.

*   **Input:** Blue line at column 6. Azure (8) and Yellow (4) objects are to the *right* of the line.
*   **Expected Output:** Blue line at column 6. The *original* Azure/Yellow objects appear reflected to the *left* of the line (with swapped colors: Azure->Yellow, Yellow->Azure). Additionally, the Azure/Yellow objects that were *originally* to the right also appear on the right, but with their colors swapped. This contradicts the initial assessment based on output images. Let me re-examine.

*   **Re-assessment of Example 1:**
    *   Input: Blue line (1) is vertical at index `c=6`. Objects (8, 4) are to the right (`c > 6`).
    *   Expected Output: Blue line (1) is vertical at `c=6`. The *original* objects (8, 4) that were at `c>6` are now *gone* from the right side. Instead, their *reflected and color-swapped* versions appear on the *left* side (`c < 6`). Let's check the coordinates:
        *   Input (2, 8) = 8 (Azure). Distance from axis (c=6) is 8-6 = +2. Reflected c = 6 - 2 = 4. Swapped color = 4 (Yellow). Expected Output (2, 4) = 4. **Incorrect, Expected Output (2, 8) = 4**. It seems the *original column* is used for the swapped color. Let's re-examine the expected output visually.

    *   **Visual Re-check of Example 1:**
        *   Input Object 1 (Azure, 8): (2,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10)
        *   Input Object 2 (Yellow, 4): (3,10)
        *   Axis: c=6
        *   Expected Output Object 1 (Yellow, 4): (2,8), (3,9), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10) -> **Wait, these are the original positions!** But the colors are swapped (8->4).
        *   Expected Output Object 2 (Azure, 8): (3,10) -> **Original position!** Color swapped (4->8).
        *   Expected Output also has new objects on the *left* side (`c<6`):
            *   New Object 1 (Azure, 8): (2,4), (3,3?), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) -> Seems reflected shape of Input Object 1. Let's check reflection:
                *   (2, 8) -> dist +2 -> reflect c = 6-2 = 4 -> (2, 4) color 8->4. **Output has 8 here.**
                *   (3, 9) -> dist +3 -> reflect c = 6-3 = 3 -> (3, 3) color 8->4. **Output has 8 here.**
                *   (4, 8) -> dist +2 -> reflect c = 6-2 = 4 -> (4, 4) color 8->4. **Output has 4 here.**
                *   (4, 9) -> dist +3 -> reflect c = 6-3 = 3 -> (4, 3) color 8->4. **Output has 4 here.**
                *   (4, 10) -> dist +4 -> reflect c = 6-4 = 2 -> (4, 2) color 8->4. **Output has 8 here.**
            *   New Object 2 (Yellow, 4): (3, 2) -> Reflected shape of Input Object 2.
                *   (3, 10) -> dist +4 -> reflect c = 6-4 = 2 -> (3, 2) color 4->8. **Output has 4 here.**

    *   **Revised Hypothesis:** This is much more complex. It seems like:
        1.  Find the axis (vertical in Ex1, horizontal in Ex2, Ex3).
        2.  Identify objects on one side (e.g., right side in Ex1, above in Ex2, below in Ex3). Let's call this the "source" side. The other side is the "target" side.
        3.  The objects on the source side *disappear* from the source side in the output.
        4.  The *color-swapped versions* of the source objects appear in their *original positions* on the source side (e.g., Ex1 right side has swapped colors). **No, re-reading Ex1 Output, the right side is empty except for the axis.** My previous reading was wrong.
        5.  The *reflected versions* of the source objects appear on the *target* side, but *their colors are also swapped*.

    *   **Let's re-re-check Example 1:**
        *   Input: Vertical axis c=6. Objects 8 & 4 are right (c>6). Left side (c<6) is empty.
        *   Output: Vertical axis c=6. Right side (c>6) is empty. Left side (c<6) contains the *reflected* shapes, but with *swapped* colors.
            *   Input (2, 8)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (2, 4). Swap 8->4. Output (2, 4)=4. **Match!**
            *   Input (3, 9)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (3, 3). Swap 8->4. Output (3, 3)=4. **Match!**
            *   Input (4, 8)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (4, 4). Swap 8->4. Output (4, 4)=4. **Match!**
            *   Input (4, 9)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (4, 3). Swap 8->4. Output (4, 3)=4. **Match!**
            *   Input (4, 10)=8 -> reflect across c=6 -> (4, 2). Swap 8->4. Output (4, 2)=4. **Match!**
            *   Input (3, 10)=4 -> reflect across c=6 -> (3, 2). Swap 4->8. Output (3, 2)=8. **Match!**

    *   **Let's check Example 2 with this new hypothesis:**
        *   Input: Horizontal axis r=4. Objects 2 & 3 are above (r<4). Below (r>4) is empty.
        *   Output: Horizontal axis r=4. Above (r<4) is empty. Below (r>4) contains *reflected* shapes with *swapped* colors.
            *   Input (0, 3)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (8, 3). Swap 2->3. Output (8, 3)=3. **Match!**
            *   Input (0, 5)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (8, 5). Swap 2->3. Output (8, 5)=3. **Match!**
            *   Input (1, 2)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 2). Swap 2->3. Output (7, 2)=3. **Match!**
            *   Input (1, 3)=3 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 3). Swap 3->2. Output (7, 3)=2. **Match!**
            *   Input (1, 4)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 4). Swap 2->3. Output (7, 4)=3. **Match!**
            *   Input (1, 5)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (7, 5). Swap 2->3. Output (7, 5)=3. **Match!**
            *   Input (2, 4)=2 -> reflect across r=4 -> (6, 4). Swap 2->3. Output (6, 4)=3. **Match!**

    *   **Let's check Example 3:**
        *   Input: Horizontal axis r=8. Objects 5 & 6 are below (r>8). Above (r<8) is empty.
        *   Output: Horizontal axis r=8. Below (r>8) is empty. Above (r<8) contains *reflected* shapes with *swapped* colors.
            *   Input (10, 2)=5 -> reflect across r=8 -> (6, 2). Swap 5->6. Output (6, 2)=6. **Match!**
            *   Input (10, 3)=6 -> reflect across r=8 -> (6, 3). Swap 6->5. Output (6, 3)=5. **Match!**
            *   ...and so on. This pattern holds.

    *   **Final Confirmed Hypothesis:**
        1.  Identify the axis (vertical or horizontal line containing blue (1) and maybe white (0) pixels, choosing the one with the most blue pixels).
        2.  Identify all non-axis, non-background pixels. These constitute the "source objects". Note: All source objects appear only on *one* side of the axis in the examples.
        3.  Create an empty output grid (all white/0).
        4.  Copy only the blue (1) pixels from the axis line onto the output grid.
        5.  For each pixel belonging to a source object:
            a.  Calculate its reflected position across the axis.
            b.  Determine the swapped color using the pairs (8<>4, 2<>3, 5<>6).
            c.  Place the *swapped color* at the *reflected position* in the output grid.
        6.  The original positions of the source objects remain empty (white/0) in the output grid because we start with an empty grid and only add the reflected, swapped pixels.

This matches the results from the code execution - the code *was* correctly reflecting and swapping, but my interpretation of the *expected* output was flawed initially. The code failed because the axis finding or reflection logic must have a subtle bug. Let's re-examine the code's logic vs the failed Example 1.

*   Code `find_reflection_axis` correctly identifies axis `c=6` (vertical) for Ex1.
*   Code initializes `output_np` to zeros.
*   Code copies blue pixels from axis `c=6` to `output_np`. Correct.
*   Code iterates through input `(r, c)`.
*   Consider input pixel (2, 8) = 8.
    *   `original_color = 8`. Not 0.

**Conclusion from Re-analysis:** The code *seems* to be implementing the "Final Confirmed Hypothesis" correctly. Why did the comparison fail? Let's look at the *full* transformed output vs expected for Example 1 again.

Expected:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0  <- ERROR IS HERE
0 0 4 8 0 0 1 0 0 4 8 0  <- ERROR IS HERE
0 0 8 8 8 0 1 0 4 4 4 0  <- ERROR IS HERE
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
...
```

Transformed:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  <- No, I misread the report output image earlier. THIS IS THE ACTUAL TRANSFORMED OUTPUT
0 0 8 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  <- THIS IS THE ACTUAL TRANSFORMED OUTPUT
0 0 4 4 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 0  <- THIS IS THE ACTUAL TRANSFORMED OUTPUT
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
...
```

My detailed trace matches the "Transformed Output" reported. The discrepancy lies between the "Transformed Output" and the "Expected Output".

*   Expected Output has objects on *both* sides of the axis.
*   Transformed Output has objects *only* on the side opposite the original objects.

**Where did the objects on the right side of the Expected Output come from?**
Looking at Expected Output for Ex 1:
*   Left side (`c<6`): has reflected & swapped shapes from input right side. (e.g., `output[2,4]=4`, `output[3,2]=8`)
*   Right side (`c>6`): has *different* shapes.
    *   `output[2,8]=4`, `output[2,10]=4`
    *   `output[3,9]=4`, `output[3,11]=8`
    *   `output[4,8]=4`, `output[4,9]=4`, `output[4,10]=4`
These shapes on the right side of the output do *not* correspond directly to the input shapes on the right side. Are they reflections of something else? There was nothing on the left side of the input. This implies a more complex rule than simple reflection.

Let's reconsider the "objectness" prior. Maybe the transformation applies to the *bounding box* or some property *of the object* rather than pixel-by-pixel?

**Hypothesis 3: Object-based Reflection + Color Swap**
1. Find Axis.
2. Find contiguous objects (non-axis, non-background) on one side ("source side").
3. For each source object:
    a. Determine its bounding box.
    b. Reflect the bounding box across the axis to the "target side".
    c. "Stamp" the object onto the target side, aligned with the reflected bounding box, BUT using the swapped color(s).
    d. What happens on the source side? Does it become blank? Does it get filled with something else?

Let's try this on Ex 1:
*   Input objects on right (c>6). Axis c=6.
*   Object 1 (Azure 8): Pixels {(2, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10)}. Bbox approx R=[2,4], C=[8,10].
*   Object 2 (Yellow 4): Pixel {(3, 10)}. Bbox R=[3,3], C=[10,10].
*   Combined Bbox: R=[2,4], C=[8,10].
*   Reflect Bbox across c=6: C=[8,10] -> Dist from 6 is [+2, +4]. Reflect -> [-2, -4] from 6 -> C = [6-2, 6-4] = [4, 2]. So reflected C range is [2, 4]. Reflected Bbox: R=[2,4], C=[2,4].
*   Stamp Object 1 with swapped color 4 into reflected Bbox R=[2,4], C=[2,4].
    *   Original (2,8) -> Relative (0,0) in its bbox. Put color 4 at reflected bbox (0,0) -> (2,2)? No, maybe reflect relative coords? (2,8) is top-left-ish. Reflect c=8 -> c=4. Put swapped color 4 at (2,4).
    *   Original (3,9) -> Relative (1,1). Reflect c=9 -> c=3. Put swapped color 4 at (3,3).
    *   Original (4,8) -> Relative (2,0). Reflect c=8 -> c=4. Put swapped color 4 at (4,4).
    *   Original (4,9) -> Relative (2,1). Reflect c=9 -> c=3. Put swapped color 4 at (4,3).
    *   Original (4,10) -> Relative (2,2). Reflect c=10 -> c=2. Put swapped color 4 at (4,2).
*   Stamp Object 2 with swapped color 8 into reflected Bbox R=[2,4], C=[2,4].
    *   Original (3,10) -> Relative (1,2). Reflect c=10 -> c=2. Put swapped color 8 at (3,2).
*   Resulting left side:
    *   (2,4)=4
    *   (3,2)=8, (3,3)=4
    *   (4,2)=4, (4,3)=4, (4,4)=4
*   This **matches** the left side of the **Transformed Output** from the code, which we know is *incorrect* compared to the **Expected Output**.

There must be something fundamentally different happening.

**Hypothesis 4: Dual Reflection / Symmetry**

Perhaps the rule isn't "reflect A to get B", but "create a symmetric output based on input A".
Look at Ex1 Expected Output:
*   Axis c=6 (Blue 1s).
*   Left side (c<6): Contains shapes.
*   Right side (c>6): Contains shapes.
*   Is the left side a reflection of the right side (or vice-versa) within the *output* grid?
    *   Output (2,4)=4. Reflect across c=6 -> (2, 8). Output (2,8)=4. Match.
    *   Output (2,2)=8. Reflect -> (2, 10). Output (2,10)=4. **No Match.** -> Wait, output[2,2] is 0. My reading of expected output is difficult.
    *   Let's use code to print the expected output clearly.
