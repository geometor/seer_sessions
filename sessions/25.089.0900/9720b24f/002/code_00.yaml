Task: Enclosed Pixel Removal (Refined Definition)

Priors:
  - Objectness: Non-white pixels form contiguous objects. Some objects act as boundaries.
  - Geometry/Topology: Adjacency (up, down, left, right) is key. The concept of "inside" vs "outside" a boundary is central.

Observations:
  - Background: White (0) pixels represent empty space or the background.
  - Boundaries: Contiguous regions of a single non-white color can form boundaries.
  - Enclosed Pixels: Pixels of a different color located "inside" such a boundary.
  - Definition of "Inside": A pixel (or a contiguous region of same-colored pixels) is considered inside if a search (like BFS) starting from it, expanding only through pixels of its own color, encounters *only* pixels of a single other non-white color (the boundary color) before exhausting all reachable pixels of its own color. Crucially, the search must *not* reach the grid edge or a white (0) pixel while expanding through the pixels being checked for enclosure.
  - Action: If a pixel (or region) is identified as enclosed, change its color to white (0) in the output.
  - Unchanged Pixels:
      - Pixels forming the boundaries remain unchanged.
      - Pixels not enclosed (either because they can reach the edge/white space, or because their boundary is multi-colored or non-existent) remain unchanged.
      - White background pixels remain unchanged.

Examples Revisited:
  - train_1: Orange (7) pixel at (1,1) is enclosed by blue (1). BFS from (1,1) only finds blue (1) neighbors before stopping. Change 7 to 0.
  - train_2: Gray (5) region is enclosed by red (2). Azure (8) region is enclosed by magenta (6). BFS from gray pixels only hits red. BFS from azure pixels only hits magenta. Change 5s and 8s to 0.
  - train_3: Magenta (6) region enclosed by green (3). Azure (8) region enclosed by orange (7). Change enclosed 6s and 8s to 0. Note the `6` pixels *not* enclosed by green (3) at (3,3) and (4,3)/(4,4) remain unchanged.
  - train_4: Gray (5) pixel at (3,4) enclosed by red (2). Change 5 to 0. Magenta (6) region and maroon (9) pixel are not enclosed and remain unchanged.

Summary of Transformation:
  - Identify potential enclosed regions (contiguous non-white pixels).
  - For each region, perform a check (e.g., BFS) to see if it's fully bounded by exactly one other color without any path from the region's pixels leading directly to the grid edge or a white pixel.
  - If enclosed, change all pixels of that region to white (0). Otherwise, leave them unchanged.
