            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code implementation failed on all training examples. The transformed outputs were identical to the inputs, indicating that the `find_enclosed_region` function consistently failed to identify any pixels as enclosed. The core issue lies in the logic for determining enclosure within the Breadth-First Search (BFS). Specifically, the previous BFS implementation incorrectly flagged a region as \"escaped\" if any of its pixels were adjacent to a white pixel or the grid boundary. This is too strict; a region is only truly \"not enclosed\" (escaped) if the search path, while exploring pixels *of the target color*, reaches the grid boundary or a white pixel *before* being fully surrounded by a single, different, non-white color. The boundary pixels themselves can, and often do, border white pixels or the grid edge.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the `find_enclosed_region` function's logic to correctly implement this definition of enclosure. The BFS should track the boundary colors encountered and only determine a region is *not* enclosed if it directly reaches the grid edge or white space *from* a pixel within the potential enclosed region, or if the surrounding boundary is composed of multiple colors.\n\n**Metrics on Failed Execution:**\n\nThe previous code failed to modify any pixels. Therefore, the number of pixels \"off\" in each failed example corresponds precisely to the number of pixels that *should* have been changed from their original color to white (0).\n\n"

Some objects act as boundaries.\n  - Geometry/Topology: Adjacency (up, down, left, right) is key. The concept of \"inside\" vs \"outside\" a boundary is central.\n\nObservations:\n  - Background: White (0) pixels represent empty space or the background.\n  - Boundaries: Contiguous regions of a single non-white color can form boundaries.\n  - Enclosed Pixels: Pixels of a different color located \"inside\" such a boundary.\n  - Definition of \"Inside\": A pixel (or a contiguous region of same-colored pixels) is considered inside if a search (like BFS) starting from it, expanding only through pixels of its own color, encounters *only* pixels of a single other non-white color (the boundary color) before exhausting all reachable pixels of its own color. Crucially, the search must *not* reach the grid edge or a white (0) pixel while expanding through the pixels being checked for enclosure.\n  - Action: If a pixel (or region) is identified as enclosed, change its color to white (0) in the output.\n  - Unchanged Pixels:\n      - Pixels forming the boundaries remain unchanged.\n      - Pixels not enclosed (either because they can reach the edge/white space, or because their boundary is multi-colored or non-existent) remain unchanged.\n      - White background pixels remain unchanged.\n\nExamples Revisited:\n  - train_1: Orange (7) pixel at (1,1) is enclosed by blue (1). BFS from (1,1) only finds blue (1) neighbors before stopping. Change 7 to 0.\n  - train_2: Gray (5) region is enclosed by red (2). Azure (8) region is enclosed by magenta (6). BFS from gray pixels only hits red. BFS from azure pixels only hits magenta. Change 5s and 8s to 0.\n  - train_3: Magenta (6) region enclosed by green (3). Azure (8) region enclosed by orange (7). Change enclosed 6s and 8s to 0. Note the `6` pixels *not* enclosed by green (3) at (3,3) and (4,3)/(4,4) remain unchanged.\n  - train_4: Gray (5) pixel at (3,4) enclosed by red (2). Change 5 to 0. Magenta (6) region and maroon (9) pixel are not enclosed and remain unchanged.\n\nSummary of Transformation:\n  - Identify potential enclosed regions (contiguous non-white pixels).\n  - For each region, perform a check (e.g., BFS) to see if it's fully bounded by exactly one other color without any path from the region's pixels leading directly to the grid edge or a white pixel.\n  - If enclosed, change all pixels of that region to white (0). Otherwise, leave them unchanged.\n```"
