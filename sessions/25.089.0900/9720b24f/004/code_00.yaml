Task: Monochromatic Enclosure Erasure

Global Properties:
  - Grid: Input and Output are 2D grids of pixels (0-9).
  - Background Color: White (0).
  - Objects: Contiguous regions of non-white pixels.

Object Types:
  - Region: A contiguous area of pixels sharing the same non-white color.
  - Boundary: A Region that fully encloses another Region.
  - Enclosed Region: A Region that is fully surrounded by a Boundary Region.
  - Unenclosed Region: A Region that is not fully enclosed (touches background, grid edge, or multiple boundary colors).

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are adjacent if they share an edge (not just diagonally).
  - Enclosure: A Region 'A' encloses Region 'B' if every pixel adjacent to Region 'B' belongs to Region 'A'. Crucially, Region 'A' must consist of only a single color, different from Region 'B's color, and Region 'B' must not have any adjacent white (0) pixels or touch the grid boundary.

Transformation Rule:
  - Identify all Enclosed Regions.
  - For each identified Enclosed Region, change the color of all its constituent pixels to white (0).
  - All Boundary Regions and Unenclosed Regions remain unchanged.

Example Specifics:
  - train_1: Orange(7) region (1 pixel) is enclosed by Blue(1) region. Orange(7) becomes White(0).
  - train_2:
      - Gray(5) region (4 pixels) is enclosed by Red(2) region. Gray(5) becomes White(0).
      - Azure(8) region (1 pixel at (7,6)) is enclosed by Magenta(6) region. Azure(8) becomes White(0).
      - Azure(8) region (1 pixel at (8,7)) is enclosed by Magenta(6) region. Azure(8) becomes White(0).
      - Note: The two Azure(8) pixels form separate enclosed regions based on adjacency rules.
  - train_3:
      - Magenta(6) region (3 pixels at (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)) is enclosed by Green(3) region. Magenta(6) becomes White(0).
      - Azure(8) region (3 pixels at (7,9), (8,9), (8,10)) is enclosed by Orange(7) region. Azure(8) becomes White(0).
      - Other Azure(8) regions are not enclosed and remain unchanged.
  - train_4:
      - Gray(5) region (1 pixel) is enclosed by Red(2) region. Gray(5) becomes White(0).
      - Magenta(6) and Maroon(9) regions are not involved in enclosure and remain unchanged.

Failures of Previous Code:
  - The code failed to correctly identify enclosed regions because its BFS check terminated prematurely or misidentified boundary conditions based on local neighbor checks rather than checking the boundary of the complete region.
  - Specifically, it flagged regions as "escaped" if any pixel within them had a white neighbor, even if that white neighbor was separated from the region by the boundary.
