            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided Python code consistently failed to modify the input grids as expected across all training examples. The core issue lies in the `check_enclosure_and_get_region` function's logic for determining if a region is \"enclosed\". The original Breadth-First Search (BFS) incorrectly concluded a region was not enclosed if any single pixel within it had a direct path to the background (white pixels) or the grid edge, or if it encountered boundary pixels during the expansion from a specific node.\n\nThe correct interpretation, derived from analyzing the input/output pairs, is that a contiguous region of a single color (`target_color`) is considered \"enclosed\" if and only if *all* pixels immediately adjacent to the *entire region* share the same, single, non-white color (`boundary_color`). The `target_color` must be different from the `boundary_color`. If any pixel adjacent to the region is white (0), touches the grid edge, or if the adjacent pixels have multiple different colors, the region is not enclosed.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the `check_enclosure_and_get_region` function (or its equivalent).\n2.  The function should first perform a search (like BFS or DFS) to identify the complete set of contiguous pixels belonging to the starting `target_color` (`region_pixels`).\n3.  Once the region is identified, examine all pixels directly adjacent (4-directionally) to *any* pixel within `region_pixels`.\n4.  Collect the colors of these adjacent pixels.\n5.  Determine enclosure based on these adjacent colors:\n    *   If any adjacent pixel is white (0) or the region touches the grid edge, it's NOT enclosed.\n    *   If all adjacent pixels exist within the grid, are not white, and all share the *exact same* non-white color (which is different from `target_color`), it IS enclosed.\n    *   Otherwise (e.g., multiple adjacent colors, no adjacent pixels found), it's NOT enclosed.\n6.  The main `transform` function will use this corrected check. If a region is determined to be enclosed, all pixels within `region_pixels` will be set to white (0) in the output grid. A `processed_mask` is still crucial to avoid redundant checks on pixels belonging to the same region.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Examples:**\n\n"

Crucially, Region 'A' must consist of only a single color, different from Region 'B's color, and Region 'B' must not have any adjacent white (0) pixels or touch the grid boundary.\n\nTransformation Rule:\n  - Identify all Enclosed Regions.\n  - For each identified Enclosed Region, change the color of all its constituent pixels to white (0).\n  - All Boundary Regions and Unenclosed Regions remain unchanged.\n\nExample Specifics:\n  - train_1: Orange(7) region (1 pixel) is enclosed by Blue(1) region. Orange(7) becomes White(0).\n  - train_2:\n      - Gray(5) region (4 pixels) is enclosed by Red(2) region. Gray(5) becomes White(0).\n      - Azure(8) region (1 pixel at (7,6)) is enclosed by Magenta(6) region. Azure(8) becomes White(0).\n      - Azure(8) region (1 pixel at (8,7)) is enclosed by Magenta(6) region. Azure(8) becomes White(0).\n      - Note: The two Azure(8) pixels form separate enclosed regions based on adjacency rules.\n  - train_3:\n      - Magenta(6) region (3 pixels at (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)) is enclosed by Green(3) region. Magenta(6) becomes White(0).\n      - Azure(8) region (3 pixels at (7,9), (8,9), (8,10)) is enclosed by Orange(7) region. Azure(8) becomes White(0).\n      - Other Azure(8) regions are not enclosed and remain unchanged.\n  - train_4:\n      - Gray(5) region (1 pixel) is enclosed by Red(2) region. Gray(5) becomes White(0).\n      - Magenta(6) and Maroon(9) regions are not involved in enclosure and remain unchanged.\n\nFailures of Previous Code:\n  - The code failed to correctly identify enclosed regions because its BFS check terminated prematurely or misidentified boundary conditions based on local neighbor checks rather than checking the boundary of the complete region.\n  - Specifically, it flagged regions as \"escaped\" if any pixel within them had a white neighbor, even if that white neighbor was separated from the region by the boundary.\n```"

Create a boolean grid `processed_mask` of the same dimensions as the input, initialized to `False`. This mask will track pixels that have already been evaluated as part of a region.\n3.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n4.  If the pixel `(r, c)` is non-white (not 0) and `processed_mask[r, c]` is `False`:\n    a.  Identify the full contiguous region of pixels having the same color as `input_grid[r, c]`. Let this color be `target_color` and the set of pixel coordinates be `region_pixels`.\n    b.  Mark all pixels in `region_pixels` as `True` in `processed_mask`.\n    c.  Find all pixels *adjacent* (up, down, left, right) to *any* pixel in `region_pixels`. Store these adjacent pixel coordinates in a set `adjacent_coords`.\n    d.  Initialize `is_enclosed = True` and `boundary_color = None`.\n    e.  If `adjacent_coords` is empty (the region has no neighbors), set `is_enclosed = False`.\n    f.  Iterate through each coordinate `(ar, ac)` in `adjacent_coords`:\n        i.   Check if `(ar, ac)` is outside the grid boundaries. If yes, set `is_enclosed = False` and break this inner loop.\n        ii.  Get the color `adj_color = input_grid[ar, ac]`.\n        iii. If `adj_color` is white (0), set `is_enclosed = False` and break this inner loop.\n        iv.  If `adj_color` is the same as `target_color` (this can happen if the region curves back on itself), ignore this adjacent pixel (it's part of the region, not the boundary).\n        v.   If `adj_color` is a non-white color different from `target_color`:\n            1.  If `boundary_color` is `None`, set `boundary_color = adj_color`.\n            2.  If `boundary_color` is not `None` but `adj_color != boundary_color`, set `is_enclosed = False` (multiple boundary colors found) and break this inner loop.\n    g.  After checking all adjacent pixels, if `is_enclosed` is still `True` AND `boundary_color` is not `None` (meaning a single, valid boundary color was consistently found):\n        i.  Iterate through all pixels `(pr, pc)` in `region_pixels`.\n        ii. Set `output_grid[pr, pc] = 0`.\n5.  Return the `output_grid`."
