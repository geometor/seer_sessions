```python
"""
Identifies contiguous regions of pixels (sharing the same non-white color) 
that are fully enclosed by a boundary composed entirely of a single, different, 
non-white color. The enclosure must be complete, meaning the enclosed region 
cannot touch the grid border or any white (0) pixels. 
If a region is identified as enclosed, all pixels within that region are 
changed to white (0) in the output grid. Pixels forming the boundaries 
and pixels in regions that are not enclosed remain unchanged.
