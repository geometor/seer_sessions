Task: Enclosed Pixel Removal

Examples:
  - ID: train_1
    Input: 3x3 grid with a blue (1) border enclosing an orange (7) pixel.
    Output: Blue border remains, enclosed orange (7) pixel becomes white (0).
    Objects:
      - Type: Boundary
        Color: blue (1)
        Shape: Square frame
      - Type: Enclosed Pixel
        Color: orange (7)
        Position: Center
    Action: Change color of Enclosed Pixel to white (0).
    Relationship: orange (7) pixel is enclosed by the blue (1) boundary.

  - ID: train_2
    Input: Grid with two main shapes: red (2) 'C' enclosing gray (5) pixels, magenta (6) 'L' enclosing an azure (8) pixel.
    Output: Red and magenta shapes remain, enclosed gray (5) and azure (8) pixels become white (0).
    Objects:
      - Type: Boundary
        Color: red (2)
        Encloses: gray (5) pixels
      - Type: Boundary
        Color: magenta (6)
        Encloses: azure (8) pixel
    Action: Change color of enclosed gray (5) and azure (8) pixels to white (0).
    Relationship: gray (5) pixels enclosed by red (2), azure (8) pixel enclosed by magenta (6).

  - ID: train_3
    Input: Grid with green (3) shape enclosing magenta (6) pixels, and orange (7) shape enclosing azure (8) pixels. Other pixels exist outside these enclosures.
    Output: Green and orange shapes remain. Enclosed magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels become white (0). Other pixels unchanged.
    Objects:
      - Type: Boundary
        Color: green (3)
        Encloses: magenta (6) pixels
      - Type: Boundary
        Color: orange (7)
        Encloses: azure (8) pixels
    Action: Change color of enclosed magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels to white (0).
    Relationship: magenta (6) pixels enclosed by green (3), azure (8) pixels enclosed by orange (7).

  - ID: train_4
    Input: Grid with red (2) 'C' enclosing a gray (5) pixel. A magenta (6) shape and a maroon (9) pixel exist but do not enclose anything or are not enclosed.
    Output: Red shape remains. Enclosed gray (5) pixel becomes white (0). Magenta shape and maroon pixel remain unchanged.
    Objects:
      - Type: Boundary
        Color: red (2)
        Encloses: gray (5) pixel
      - Type: Shape (Not a boundary in this context)
        Color: magenta (6)
      - Type: Pixel
        Color: maroon (9)
    Action: Change color of enclosed gray (5) pixel to white (0).
    Relationship: gray (5) pixel enclosed by red (2). Magenta (6) and maroon (9) are not involved in enclosure.

Summary:
  - Identify contiguous regions of a single non-white color that form closed boundaries.
  - Identify pixels located strictly *inside* these boundaries.
  - The color of the boundary object is irrelevant to the action, only its shape matters.
  - The color of the enclosed pixel is irrelevant; *any* non-white pixel inside a boundary (that isn't part of the boundary itself) is targeted.
  - Pixels that are part of the boundary, or pixels outside any boundary, are not modified.
  - The action is always to change the color of the enclosed pixel(s) to white (0).
