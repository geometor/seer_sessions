            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task based on the examples provided.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors.\n2.  **Objects:** The non-white pixels often form contiguous shapes or regions. Some of these shapes appear to act as containers or boundaries.\n3.  **Background:** The white (0) pixels seem to represent the background or empty space.\n4.  **Colors:** Various colors (blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon) are used. White (0) is the background. Specific colors like gray (5), orange (7), azure (8), and magenta (6) appear *inside* other colored shapes in the inputs.\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying pixels enclosed within certain shapes and changing their color to white (0). The enclosing shapes themselves remain unchanged. Pixels not enclosed also remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Other pixels exist outside these enclosures.\n    Output: Green and orange shapes remain. Enclosed magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels become white (0). Other pixels unchanged.\n    Objects:\n      - Type: Boundary\n        Color: green (3)\n        Encloses: magenta (6) pixels\n      - Type: Boundary\n        Color: orange (7)\n        Encloses: azure (8) pixels\n    Action: Change color of enclosed magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels to white (0).\n    Relationship: magenta (6) pixels enclosed by green (3), azure (8) pixels enclosed by orange (7).\n\n  - ID: train_4\n    Input: Grid with red (2) 'C' enclosing a gray (5) pixel. A magenta (6) shape and a maroon (9) pixel exist but do not enclose anything or are not enclosed.\n    Output: Red shape remains. Enclosed gray (5) pixel becomes white (0). Magenta shape and maroon pixel remain unchanged.\n    Objects:\n      - Type: Boundary\n        Color: red (2)\n        Encloses: gray (5) pixel\n      - Type: Shape (Not a boundary in this context)\n        Color: magenta (6)\n      - Type: Pixel\n        Color: maroon (9)\n    Action: Change color of enclosed gray (5) pixel to white (0).\n    Relationship: gray (5) pixel enclosed by red (2). Magenta (6) and maroon (9) are not involved in enclosure.\n\nSummary:\n  - Identify contiguous regions of a single non-white color that form closed boundaries.\n  - Identify pixels located strictly *inside* these boundaries.\n  - The color of the boundary object is irrelevant to the action, only its shape matters.\n  - The color of the enclosed pixel is irrelevant; *any* non-white pixel inside a boundary (that isn't part of the boundary itself) is targeted.\n  - Pixels that are part of the boundary, or pixels outside any boundary, are not modified.\n  - The action is always to change the color of the enclosed pixel(s) to white (0).\n```"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` in the input grid.\n3.  If the pixel at `(r, c)` in the output grid is not white (0) and has not yet been processed as part of an identified enclosed region:\n    a.  Check if this pixel `(r, c)` is enclosed by a single-colored boundary. To do this:\n        i.  Perform a flood fill (or similar search like Breadth-First Search) starting from `(r, c)`, only moving to adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells that are *not* the same color as the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *input* grid.\n        ii. During the search, keep track of the different colors encountered. Let the color of the starting pixel `(r, c)` be `target_color`.\n        iii. If the search encounters the grid boundary or a white (0) pixel *before* encountering any other color, the pixel `(r, c)` is *not* enclosed. Stop the check for this pixel.\n        iv. If the search encounters pixels of only *one* specific non-white color (let's call it `boundary_color`) before hitting the grid edge or a white pixel, and `boundary_color` is different from `target_color`, then the pixel `(r, c)` *might* be enclosed by `boundary_color`. Continue the search.\n        v. If the search completes (cannot expand further) and has only encountered `boundary_color` pixels (besides the initial `target_color` pixels) and has *not* reached the grid edge or a white pixel, then the pixel `(r, c)` is confirmed to be enclosed by the `boundary_color`.\n    b. If the pixel `(r, c)` is confirmed to be enclosed:\n        i.  Change the color of the pixel at `(r, c)` in the *output* grid to white (0).\n        ii. Mark all pixels visited during the successful enclosure check flood fill (those with `target_color`) as processed to avoid re-checking them.\n4.  Return the modified output grid."
