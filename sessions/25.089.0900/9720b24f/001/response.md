def find_enclosed_region(grid, r, c, processed_mask):
    """
    Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from (r, c) to find a potentially 
    enclosed region of the same color, checking the color(s) of its adjacent boundary.

    The region is considered enclosed if:
    1. The BFS explores all contiguous pixels of the starting color ('target_color').
    2. During the BFS, it only encounters adjacent pixels of *one* specific non-white, 
       non-target color ('boundary_color').
    3. The BFS does not reach the grid boundary or a white (0) pixel directly from 
       a pixel of 'target_color'.

    Args:
        grid (np.array): The input grid.
        r (int): Starting row index.
        c (int): Starting column index.
        processed_mask (np.array): Boolean mask indicating pixels that have already 
                                   been processed (e.g., identified as part of a 
                                   previously found enclosed region).

    Returns:
        tuple: (is_enclosed, enclosed_pixels_set)
               is_enclosed (bool): True if the region starting at (r, c) is enclosed
                                   by a single non-white color different from its own, 
                                   False otherwise.
               enclosed_pixels_set (set): A set of coordinates {(row, col)} belonging
                                          to the contiguous region of 'target_color' 
                                          if is_enclosed is True, otherwise an empty set.
