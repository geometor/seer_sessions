def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by moving non-background pixels based on their color.

    1. Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2. Identifies all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (azure, 8).
    3. For each identified non-background pixel:
        a. Determines its color and original position (row, column).
        b. Calculates the new position based on the pixel's color:
            - Orange (7): Move 2 rows up.
            - Red (2): Move 2 columns left.
            - Maroon (9): Move 2 rows down.
            - Blue (1): Move 1 column right.
        c. Sets the pixel at the original position in the output grid to the background color (azure, 8).
        d. Sets the pixel at the calculated new position in the output grid to the original color of the non-background pixel.
    4. Returns the modified output grid.
