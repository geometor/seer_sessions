**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 10x10 grid. The input grid consists predominantly of a background color (azure, 8). Embedded within this background are one or two isolated pixels of a different color (orange, red, maroon, or blue). The output grid maintains the same dimensions and background color, but the positions of the non-background pixels are shifted. The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the specific color of the pixel.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
grid_properties:
  size: 10x10
  background_color: 8 # azure
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color_property: non_background # Any color other than azure (8)
    count: 1 or 2 per grid in examples
actions:
  - type: move
    target: non_background_pixels
    details:
      - condition: pixel_color == 7 # orange
        translation: [-2, 0] # 2 rows up
      - condition: pixel_color == 2 # red
        translation: [0, -2] # 2 columns left
      - condition: pixel_color == 9 # maroon
        translation: [2, 0] # 2 rows down
      - condition: pixel_color == 1 # blue
        translation: [0, 1] # 1 column right
    post_action:
      original_position_color: 8 # azure (background)
relationships:
  - movement_rule depends_on pixel_color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color (azure, 8).
3.  For each identified non-background pixel:
    a.  Determine its color.
    b.  Determine its original position (row, column).
    c.  Calculate the new position based on the pixel's color:
        *   If the color is orange (7), the new row is the original row minus 2. The column remains the same.
        *   If the color is red (2), the new column is the original column minus 2. The row remains the same.
        *   If the color is maroon (9), the new row is the original row plus 2. The column remains the same.
        *   If the color is blue (1), the new column is the original column plus 1. The row remains the same.
    d.  Set the pixel at the original position in the output grid to the background color (azure, 8).
    e.  Set the pixel at the calculated new position in the output grid to the original color of the non-background pixel.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
