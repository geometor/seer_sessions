            "text": "**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. The grids contain a white background (0), gray structures (5), and scattered pixels of other colors (green=3, red=2, blue=1). The gray structures appear as solid horizontal lines or rectangles. The other colored pixels act as 'source' or 'trigger' pixels.\n\nThe core transformation seems to involve a downward projection or influence from the source pixels onto the gray structures. Specifically, if a source pixel exists in a column that also contains gray pixels below it, the cell directly above the *topmost* gray pixel in that column is changed to gray in the output grid. The original source pixels are removed (become white) in the output, while the gray structures and the rest of the background remain unchanged unless modified by the projection rule.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
