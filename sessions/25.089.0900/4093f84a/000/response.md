**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid. The grids contain a white background (0), gray structures (5), and scattered pixels of other colors (green=3, red=2, blue=1). The gray structures appear as solid horizontal lines or rectangles. The other colored pixels act as 'source' or 'trigger' pixels.

The core transformation seems to involve a downward projection or influence from the source pixels onto the gray structures. Specifically, if a source pixel exists in a column that also contains gray pixels below it, the cell directly above the *topmost* gray pixel in that column is changed to gray in the output grid. The original source pixels are removed (become white) in the output, while the gray structures and the rest of the background remain unchanged unless modified by the projection rule.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input_Grid:
  - Objects:
      - Background:
          - Color: white (0)
          - Role: Default state for most cells.
      - Structure:
          - Color: gray (5)
          - Shape: Horizontal lines or rectangles.
          - Role: Target area for modification.
      - Source_Pixels:
          - Color: Variable (green=3, red=2, blue=1 in examples)
          - Shape: Single pixels.
          - Role: Initiate the transformation.
          - Property: Position (row, column).
  - Relationships:
      - Source_Pixels are located relative to the Structure (above, below, or horizontally distant).
      - Vertical alignment (same column) between Source_Pixels and Structure pixels is crucial.

Transformation:
  - Action: Vertical downward influence or projection.
  - Condition: A Source_Pixel must have at least one gray Structure pixel directly below it in the same column.
  - Effect:
      - Identify the column of the Source_Pixel.
      - Find the topmost gray Structure pixel in that column.
      - Change the color of the cell immediately *above* this topmost gray pixel to gray (5).
  - Side_Effects:
      - Source_Pixels are removed (become white (0)) in the output grid.
      - Unaffected white background cells remain white.
      - Original gray Structure pixels remain gray.
      - Cells modified by the projection become gray.

Output_Grid:
  - Composition: Primarily resembles the input grid's background and structure.
  - Modifications:
      - Source_Pixels are absent (replaced by white).
      - Specific white cells located directly above the original gray Structure are turned gray based on the transformation rule.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Identify all 'source' pixels in the input grid (pixels that are not white (0) and not gray (5)). Record their row and column coordinates.
3.  For each identified source pixel:
    a.  Set the color of the corresponding cell in the *output* grid to white (0).
    b.  Check the column of the source pixel in the *input* grid, starting from the row below the source pixel and going downwards.
    c.  Search for the first occurrence of a gray (5) pixel in that column.
    d.  If a gray pixel is found at `(gray_row, source_column)`:
        i.  Determine the coordinates of the cell immediately above it: `(gray_row - 1, source_column)`.
        ii. Set the color of this cell `(gray_row - 1, source_column)` in the *output* grid to gray (5).
    e.  If no gray pixel is found below the source pixel in its column, do nothing further for this source pixel.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
