Input_Grid:
  - Objects:
      - Background:
          - Color: white (0)
          - Role: Default state for most cells.
      - Structure:
          - Color: gray (5)
          - Shape: Horizontal lines or rectangles.
          - Role: Target area for modification.
      - Source_Pixels:
          - Color: Variable (green=3, red=2, blue=1 in examples)
          - Shape: Single pixels.
          - Role: Initiate the transformation.
          - Property: Position (row, column).
  - Relationships:
      - Source_Pixels are located relative to the Structure (above, below, or horizontally distant).
      - Vertical alignment (same column) between Source_Pixels and Structure pixels is crucial.

Transformation:
  - Action: Vertical downward influence or projection.
  - Condition: A Source_Pixel must have at least one gray Structure pixel directly below it in the same column.
  - Effect:
      - Identify the column of the Source_Pixel.
      - Find the topmost gray Structure pixel in that column.
      - Change the color of the cell immediately *above* this topmost gray pixel to gray (5).
  - Side_Effects:
      - Source_Pixels are removed (become white (0)) in the output grid.
      - Unaffected white background cells remain white.
      - Original gray Structure pixels remain gray.
      - Cells modified by the projection become gray.

Output_Grid:
  - Composition: Primarily resembles the input grid's background and structure.
  - Modifications:
      - Source_Pixels are absent (replaced by white).
      - Specific white cells located directly above the original gray Structure are turned gray based on the transformation rule.
