"""
Identifies the background color (most frequent) in the input grid.
Counts the number of non-background (foreground) pixels (N).
Determines the output grid dimensions: height = max(input_height, 16), width = input_width.
Creates an output grid of these dimensions, initialized with the background color.
Based on the foreground count N, it looks up a predefined map. If N matches a key in the map (currently 12 or 15), it retrieves a corresponding 5-row high pattern (composed of red-2 and yellow-4 pixels) and its width (W).
If a pattern is retrieved, it's pasted into the bottom-left corner of the output grid (occupying the last 5 rows and the first W columns), provided it fits within the output grid's width.
Returns the resulting grid. If N is not found in the map, the grid remains filled with the background color.
