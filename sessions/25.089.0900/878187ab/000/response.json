In train_1, the pattern is 10 columns wide; in train_2, it's 7 columns wide.\n    *   The output grid dimensions can differ slightly from the input. In train_1, dimensions are preserved (16x16 -> 16x16). In train_2, the height increases (15x15 -> 16x15). It appears the output height might be at least 16.\n    *   The key transformation seems to be: identify the background, count the non-background pixels, use this count to determine which specific 5-row high pattern (composed of red and yellow) to draw in the bottom-left corner of an output grid (potentially resized, minimum height 16), filling the rest with the background color.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
