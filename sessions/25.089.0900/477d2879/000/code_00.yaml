Task: Fill grid based on region type (outside vs inside blue shapes)

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Container_Color: Blue (1).
  - Objects:
      - Containers: Connected components of Blue(1) pixels.
      - Seeds: Non-white pixels (not Blue(1)) located on the Background(0) and not enclosed by Containers.
      - Enclosed_Pixels: Pixels (White(0) or other colors) spatially enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_White: White(0) pixels enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_Internal: Non-white, non-blue pixels enclosed by Containers.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels are arranged in a grid. Adjacency and distance (Manhattan) are important.
  - Containment: Blue(1) shapes enclose other pixels.
  - Proximity: Background(0) pixels are associated with the nearest Seed pixel.
  - Influence:
      - Seed colors determine the fill color for Background(0) pixels.
      - Enclosed_Internal colors determine the transformation of Container pixels and the fill color for Enclosed_White pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Regions: Differentiate between Background, Containers, Seeds, and Enclosed pixels.
  - Determine_Reachability: Identify which pixels can reach the grid border without crossing Blue(1) pixels (these are Background or Seeds). Pixels that cannot reach are Enclosed.
  - Calculate_Distances: Compute Manhattan distance from Background pixels to Seed pixels.
  - Apply_Voronoi_Fill: Fill reachable Background(0) pixels with the color of the nearest Seed (tie-break by row, then column).
  - Transform_Containers:
      - Change color of Container(Blue=1) pixels based on presence of Red(2) among Enclosed_Internal pixels (if Red(2) present -> Red(2), else -> Azure(8)).
      - Fill Enclosed_White pixels based on priority of Enclosed_Internal colors (Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)).
  - Preserve_Colors: Seed pixels and Enclosed_Internal pixels keep their original colors.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored.
  - No_Background: White(0) pixels are eliminated (either filled by Voronoi or Container transformation).
  - Transformed_Regions: Original regions are replaced by new colors based on the rules.
