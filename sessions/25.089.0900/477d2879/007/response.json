Partition the grid into 'reachable' (from border, avoiding blue walls) and \n    'enclosed' (not reachable) areas using BFS. Blue pixels are 'walls'.\n2.  Categorize non-white(0), non-blue(1) 'active pixels':\n    - 'Internal Influencers': Active pixels that are either NOT reachable OR \n      are 4-directionally adjacent to any blue pixel.\n    - 'External Seeds': Active pixels that ARE reachable AND are NOT \n      4-directionally adjacent to any blue pixel.\n3.  Categorize white(0) pixels:\n    - 'Reachable White': White(0) reachable by BFS.\n    - 'Enclosed White': White(0) not reachable by BFS.\n4.  Determine Wall Color: Walls (blue pixels) become Red(2) if any \n    'Internal Influencer' is Red(2); otherwise, they become Azure(8).\n5.  Determine Fill Color: 'Enclosed White' pixels are filled based on the colors \n    of 'Internal Influencers' (priority: Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)). \n    Defaults to Azure(8).\n6.  Fill Reachable Area: 'Reachable White' pixels are filled using Voronoi \n    tessellation based on 'External Seeds' (Manhattan distance, tie-break by \n    row then column).\n7.  Active pixels (seeds, influencers) retain their original color unless \n    overwritten by Wall/Fill transformations applied to the initial copy.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef _find_reachable_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds pixels reachable from the border without crossing blue (1) pixels.\n    Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) on non-blue cells starting from the border.\n    Blue pixels themselves are marked as not reachable.\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A boolean mask where True indicates a reachable pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    reachable_mask = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    queue = deque()\n\n    # Add border cells that are not blue (1) to the queue and mark reachable\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if grid[r, 0] != 1 and not reachable_mask[r, 0]:\n            queue.append((r, 0))\n            reachable_mask[r, 0] = True\n        if grid[r, cols - 1] != 1 and not reachable_mask[r, cols - 1]:\n            queue.append((r, cols - 1))\n            reachable_mask[r, cols - 1] = True\n    for c in range(1, cols - 1): # Avoid double-adding corners\n        if grid[0, c] != 1 and not reachable_mask[0, c]:\n            queue.append((0, c))\n            reachable_mask[0, c] = True\n        if grid[rows - 1, c] != 1 and not reachable_mask[rows - 1, c]:\n            queue.append((rows - 1, c))\n            reachable_mask[rows - 1, c] = True\n\n    # Perform BFS, only moving through non-blue cells\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            # Check bounds, if NOT blue, and if NOT already visited\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n               grid[nr, nc] != 1 and not reachable_mask[nr, nc]:\n                   reachable_mask[nr, nc] = True\n                   queue.append((nr, nc))\n                   \n    # Ensure blue pixels are explicitly marked as not reachable by this mask\n    reachable_mask[grid == 1] = False\n    return reachable_mask\n\ndef _get_neighbors(pos, rows, cols):\n    \"\"\"Gets 4-directional neighbors within grid bounds.\"\"\"\n    r, c = pos\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef _manhattan_distance(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Manhattan distance between two points.\"\"\"\n    return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rules described in the module docstring.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialization\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.copy(grid) # Start with a copy\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
