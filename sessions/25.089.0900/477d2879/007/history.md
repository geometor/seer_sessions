Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels (0-9). The size remains the same between input and output (13x13 in all examples).
2.  **Background:** The input grids have a white (0) background. The output grids are completely filled with non-white colors.
3.  **Key Input Components:**
    *   **Blue Shapes (Color 1):** There are distinct shapes made of blue pixels. These shapes act like containers or walls.
    *   **Internal Pixels:** Inside the blue shapes, there can be white pixels (0) or other colored pixels (e.g., red, azure, magenta, green).
    *   **External "Seed" Pixels:** There are isolated non-white pixels located outside the blue shapes, on the white background.
4.  **Transformation - Background:** The white background pixels in the input are filled in the output. The fill color for any given background pixel seems to be determined by the color of the nearest "seed" pixel (using Manhattan distance). This resembles a Voronoi tessellation based on the seed pixels. Tie-breaking likely uses row/column order.
5.  **Transformation - Blue Shapes:**
    *   The blue (1) pixels themselves change color. This new color seems dependent on the colors of the *internal* pixels enclosed by the blue shape. If an internal red (2) pixel exists, the blue pixels become red (2) (Example 1). Otherwise, they become azure (8) (Examples 2 and 3).
    *   The white (0) pixels *enclosed* by the blue shapes are also filled. The fill color depends on the internal non-blue pixels present: Green (3) takes precedence, then Magenta (6), then Azure (8). (Ex3: internal 3,6,8 -> fill 3; Ex2: internal 6,8 -> fill 6; Ex1: internal 2,8 -> fill 8).
    *   The non-white, non-blue pixels *enclosed* by the blue shapes retain their original color in the output.
6.  **Object Interaction:** The blue shapes act as barriers defining distinct "inside" and "outside" regions. The external seeds influence the outside fill, while the internal pixels influence the transformation of the container (blue shape) itself and the fill color of the enclosed white space.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
Task: Fill grid based on region type (outside vs inside blue shapes)

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Container_Color: Blue (1).
  - Objects:
      - Containers: Connected components of Blue(1) pixels.
      - Seeds: Non-white pixels (not Blue(1)) located on the Background(0) and not enclosed by Containers.
      - Enclosed_Pixels: Pixels (White(0) or other colors) spatially enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_White: White(0) pixels enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_Internal: Non-white, non-blue pixels enclosed by Containers.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels are arranged in a grid. Adjacency and distance (Manhattan) are important.
  - Containment: Blue(1) shapes enclose other pixels.
  - Proximity: Background(0) pixels are associated with the nearest Seed pixel.
  - Influence:
      - Seed colors determine the fill color for Background(0) pixels.
      - Enclosed_Internal colors determine the transformation of Container pixels and the fill color for Enclosed_White pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Regions: Differentiate between Background, Containers, Seeds, and Enclosed pixels.
  - Determine_Reachability: Identify which pixels can reach the grid border without crossing Blue(1) pixels (these are Background or Seeds). Pixels that cannot reach are Enclosed.
  - Calculate_Distances: Compute Manhattan distance from Background pixels to Seed pixels.
  - Apply_Voronoi_Fill: Fill reachable Background(0) pixels with the color of the nearest Seed (tie-break by row, then column).
  - Transform_Containers:
      - Change color of Container(Blue=1) pixels based on presence of Red(2) among Enclosed_Internal pixels (if Red(2) present -> Red(2), else -> Azure(8)).
      - Fill Enclosed_White pixels based on priority of Enclosed_Internal colors (Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)).
  - Preserve_Colors: Seed pixels and Enclosed_Internal pixels keep their original colors.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored.
  - No_Background: White(0) pixels are eliminated (either filled by Voronoi or Container transformation).
  - Transformed_Regions: Original regions are replaced by new colors based on the rules.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:**
    a.  Find all connected components of blue (1) pixels. These are the "containers".
    b.  Determine which non-blue pixels can reach the grid border by only traversing non-blue pixels (using a flood fill or BFS starting from all border non-blue cells). Mark these as "reachable".
    c.  Identify "seed" pixels: These are the non-white, non-blue pixels marked as "reachable".
    d.  Identify "enclosed" pixels: These are all non-blue pixels *not* marked as "reachable".
3.  **Fill Background:**
    a.  For each pixel (r, c) that is white (0) in the input and marked as "reachable":
        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance to all identified "seed" pixels.
        ii. Find the minimum distance.
        iii. Identify all seeds at that minimum distance.
        iv. Select the seed with the lowest row index. If there's still a tie, select the one with the lowest column index.
        v.  Set the color of the pixel (r, c) in the output grid to the color of the selected nearest seed.
4.  **Transform Containers:**
    a.  For each identified blue container:
        i.  Find all "enclosed" pixels that are adjacent to this container or spatially inside it.
        ii. Collect the set of colors of the enclosed pixels that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1). Call this set `internal_colors`.
        iii. Determine the `fill_color` for enclosed white pixels: If Green(3) is in `internal_colors`, use Green(3). Else if Magenta(6) is in `internal_colors`, use Magenta(6). Else if Azure(8) is in `internal_colors`, use Azure(8). (Assume one of these will be present based on examples).
        iv. Determine the `wall_color` for the container's blue pixels: If Red(2) is in `internal_colors`, use Red(2). Otherwise, use Azure(8).
        v.  Update the output grid:
            1.  For every pixel (r, c) that was part of this container (blue=1 in input), set its color to `wall_color`.
            2.  For every pixel (r, c) that was white (0) in the input and is identified as enclosed within this container, set its color to `fill_color`.
5.  **Finalize:** The output grid now contains the transformed colors. Seed pixels and original enclosed internal pixels have retained their colors from the initial copy.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt failed significantly on all examples, indicating fundamental misunderstandings of the transformation rules, particularly concerning:

1.  **Seed Identification:** The criteria for identifying 'seed' pixels for the Voronoi fill were too restrictive. The code incorrectly excluded reachable pixels adjacent to the blue walls.
2.  **Wall Color Transformation:** The condition for changing blue walls to red was misidentified. It's not just the presence of *any* internal red pixel, but specifically an *internal red pixel adjacent to the wall*.
3.  **Region Definition:** While the basic reachability check (BFS from border avoiding blue) seems sound, the subsequent categorization and use of 'reachable' vs 'enclosed' pixels, especially those adjacent to walls, were flawed.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Pixel Roles:** Clearly define pixel categories based on reachability *and* color:
    *   `Wall`: Original Blue(1) pixels.
    *   `Reachable White`: White(0) pixels reachable from the border without crossing walls.
    *   `Enclosed White`: White(0) pixels *not* reachable.
    *   `Seeds`: *All* non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels that are reachable. Adjacency to walls is irrelevant for seed status.
    *   `Internal Colors`: Non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels that are *not* reachable.
2.  **Refine Rules based on Re-evaluation:**
    *   **Voronoi Fill:** Use *all* `Seeds` for filling `Reachable White` areas (Manhattan distance, row/col tie-break).
    *   **Wall Color:** Change `Wall` pixels to Red(2) *if and only if* there exists at least one `Internal Color` pixel that is Red(2) *and* is 4-directionally adjacent to *any* `Wall` pixel. Otherwise, change `Wall` pixels to Azure(8).
    *   **Enclosed Fill:** Fill `Enclosed White` pixels based on the set of colors present among *all* `Internal Colors`. Use priority: Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8). If none of these are present, default to Azure(8).
3.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the pixel categorizations and rule applications for each training example based on the refined understanding.

## Metrics and Analysis

**Analysis of Metric Results:**

The code execution reveals a critical flaw in the analysis: the `_find_reachable_pixels` function *itself* was likely incorrect or misinterpreted. It identified *all* non-zero, non-blue pixels as 'Seeds' and found *no* 'Internal Colors' in any example. This contradicts the visual inspection and the expected output transformations.

Specifically:
*   Example 1: Red(2) at (5,2) and Azure(8) at (5,6) are clearly inside the blue boundary and should be 'Internal', not 'Seeds'. The wall color should be Red(2), and the fill should be Azure(8).
*   Example 2: Magenta(6) at (7,9) is clearly internal. The wall color should be Azure(8), and the fill should be Magenta(6).
*   Example 3: Green(3) at (5,5) and Red(2) at (10,3) are clearly internal. The wall color should be Red(2) (because internal Red(2) at (10,3) is adjacent to wall at (10,2)), and the fill should be Green(3).

**Revised Strategy Adjustment:**

The `_find_reachable_pixels` BFS needs to correctly identify *only* the background area. Pixels are 'internal' if they are *not* blue(1) and *not* reachable via the BFS starting from the border.

Let's retry the metric gathering with a focus on ensuring the BFS correctly partitions the grid. The BFS *must* start only from border cells and *stop* at blue(1) walls. Any non-blue cell not visited by the BFS is enclosed.

**Analysis of Second Metric Results:**

The BFS is still not correctly partitioning the grid. It seems the BFS is escaping the intended enclosed areas. Let's rethink the BFS logic: it should only add neighbors if they are *within bounds*, *not already visited*, AND *not a wall (blue=1)*. The current code implements this. Why isn't it working as expected?

Could the issue be that some "internal" pixels are actually reachable because the "wall" is incomplete or has gaps?

*   Ex 1: Walls seem closed. Pixel (5,2)=Red is inside. Neighbors: (4,2)=Blue, (6,2)=Blue, (5,1)=White, (5,3)=White. (5,1) is reachable from border. (5,3) is reachable. BFS path: (0,0) -> ... -> (5,1) -> (5,2). Yes, the BFS can reach (5,2) because the wall doesn't fully enclose it from the background. Same for (5,6)=Azure. Path: (0,0) -> ... -> (4,6)=White -> (5,6).

This means the definition of "enclosed" cannot rely solely on the BFS reachability from the *outside*. A region is enclosed if it's surrounded by blue walls. We might need a different approach, perhaps using connected components *after* identifying walls.

**Revised Strategy 2.0:**

1.  **Identify Walls:** Find all Blue(1) pixels.
2.  **Identify Connected Components (Non-Walls):** Find all connected components (4-directional) of non-blue pixels.
3.  **Identify Outside Component:** The component containing border pixels is the 'outside' or 'reachable' region.
4.  **Identify Inside Components:** All other non-wall components are 'inside' or 'enclosed'.
5.  **Categorize Pixels:**
    *   `Wall`: Original Blue(1) pixels.
    *   `Reachable White`: White(0) pixels in the 'outside' component.
    *   `Enclosed White`: White(0) pixels in any 'inside' component.
    *   `Seeds`: Non-white(0) pixels in the 'outside' component.
    *   `Internal Colors`: Non-white(0) pixels in any 'inside' component.
6.  **Apply Rules (as refined previously):**
    *   Voronoi fill for `Reachable White` using `Seeds`.
    *   Wall color based on adjacency of Red(2) `Internal Colors` to `Wall` pixels.
    *   Enclosed fill for `Enclosed White` based on `Internal Colors` (priority Green>Magenta>Azure).

Let's perform this analysis manually on Example 1:
*   Walls: Identified.
*   Components: Component 1 (Outside): Contains (0,0) and all background pixels, plus (1,10)=Green, (5,2)=Red, (5,6)=Azure. Component 2 (Inside): Contains only white pixels, e.g., (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), etc.
*   Categories:
    *   Walls: Blue pixels.
    *   Reachable White: Background white pixels.
    *   Enclosed White: White pixels like (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), etc.
    *   Seeds: Green(3)@(1,10), Red(2)@(5,2), Azure(8)@(5,6).
    *   Internal Colors: None.
*   Rule Application:
    *   Wall Color: No internal Red(2) adjacent -> Wall becomes Azure(8). (Mismatch with expected output!)
    *   Enclosed Fill: No internal colors -> Fill becomes Azure(8). (Mismatch with expected output!)
    *   Voronoi: Seeds are Green(3), Red(2), Azure(8). Fill depends on nearest. (Mismatch!)

**Conclusion:** The simple connected components approach also fails to replicate Example 1's output. The core issue seems to be the definition of what constitutes the "inside" vs "outside" influence.

Let's reconsider the first approach (BFS reachability) but refine the *interpretation*. What if pixels like Red(2)@(5,2) and Azure(8)@(5,6) in Ex1 *act* as internal influencers for the wall/fill *even though they are technically reachable by the BFS*? Perhaps adjacency to the wall makes them act "internal" for rule purposes?

**Revised Strategy 3.0 (Hybrid):**

1.  **Identify Reachability:** Use BFS from border avoiding walls (`_find_reachable_pixels`). Mark reachable non-wall pixels.
2.  **Categorize Active Pixels (Non-0, Non-1):**
    *   `Internal Influencers`: *All* active pixels that are 4-directionally adjacent to *any* Blue(1) wall pixel, OR are *not* reachable by the BFS.
    *   `External Seeds`: All active pixels that are reachable by BFS AND are *not* adjacent to any Blue(1) wall pixel.
3.  **Categorize White Pixels:**
    *   `Reachable White`: White(0) reachable by BFS.
    *   `Enclosed White`: White(0) not reachable by BFS.
4.  **Determine Wall Color:** Walls (Blue(1)) become Red(2) if *any* `Internal Influencer` is Red(2). Otherwise, Walls become Azure(8). (Simplified adjacency check - if it's an influencer and Red, it counts).
5.  **Determine Fill Color:** Fill `Enclosed White` pixels based on colors of `Internal Influencers` (Priority: Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)). Default Azure(8).
6.  **Fill Reachable Area:** Fill `Reachable White` using Voronoi based on `External Seeds` only.
7.  **Final Colors:** Active pixels keep original colors unless overwritten by Wall/Fill.

Let's test Strategy 3.0 manually on examples:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Reachable: BFS marks background white, plus Green(3)@(1,10), Red(2)@(5,2), Azure(8)@(5,6).
    *   Internal Influencers: Red(2)@(5,2) (adjacent to wall), Azure(8)@(5,6) (adjacent to wall).
    *   External Seeds: Green(3)@(1,10) (reachable, not adjacent).
    *   Enclosed White: Pixels like (3,5), (3,6), etc.
    *   Wall Color: Internal Influencers include Red(2). Wall -> Red(2). (Matches!)
    *   Fill Color: Internal Influencers {Red(2), Azure(8)}. Priority -> Azure(8). (Matches!)
    *   Voronoi: Seed is Green(3). Fill -> Green(3). (Matches!)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Reachable: Background white, plus Red(2)@(1,1), Green(3)@(1,3), Azure(8)@(1,9), Magenta(6)@(7,9), Orange(7)@(8,1), Yellow(4)@(12,5).
    *   Internal Influencers: Azure(8)@(1,9) (adjacent), Magenta(6)@(7,9) (adjacent).
    *   External Seeds: Red(2)@(1,1), Green(3)@(1,3), Orange(7)@(8,1), Yellow(4)@(12,5).
    *   Enclosed White: e.g., (2,4), (2,5), etc.
    *   Wall Color: Internal Influencers {Azure(8), Magenta(6)}. No Red(2). Wall -> Azure(8). (Matches!)
    *   Fill Color: Internal Influencers {Azure(8), Magenta(6)}. Priority -> Magenta(6). (Matches!)
    *   Voronoi: Seeds {Red(2), Green(3), Orange(7), Yellow(4)}. (Matches expected pattern!)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Reachable: Background white, plus Maroon(9)@(0,2), Magenta(6)@(2,2), Azure(8)@(5,1), Green(3)@(5,5), Azure(8)@(6,8), Red(2)@(10,3), Orange(7)@(12,0).
    *   Internal Influencers: Magenta(6)@(2,2) (adjacent), Azure(8)@(5,1) (adjacent), Green(3)@(5,5) (adjacent), Azure(8)@(6,8) (adjacent), Red(2)@(10,3) (adjacent).
    *   External Seeds: Maroon(9)@(0,2), Orange(7)@(12,0).
    *   Enclosed White: e.g., (1,2), (1,3), etc.
    *   Wall Color: Internal Influencers include Red(2). Wall -> Red(2). (Matches!)
    *   Fill Color: Internal Influencers {Magenta(6), Azure(8), Green(3), Red(2)}. Priority -> Green(3). (Matches!)
    *   Voronoi: Seeds {Maroon(9), Orange(7)}. (Matches expected pattern!)

Strategy 3.0 seems consistent with all examples.

  - Proximity: Manhattan distance used for Voronoi fill from External_Seeds. Adjacency used for Internal_Influencer definition and Wall Color rule.
  - Influence:
      - External_Seeds determine color of Reachable_White pixels via Voronoi.
      - Internal_Influencers determine Wall color transformation (presence/absence of adjacent Red(2)).
      - Internal_Influencers determine fill color for Enclosed_White pixels (priority Green>Magenta>Azure).

Actions:
  - Partition: Calculate Reachable_Mask using BFS from border avoiding Walls.
  - Categorize: Assign Roles (Wall, Internal_Influencer, External_Seed, Enclosed_White, Reachable_White) to each pixel based on color, reachability, and adjacency to walls.
  - Determine_Wall_Color: Check if any Internal_Influencer is Red(2). If yes, target color is Red(2), else Azure(8).
  - Determine_Fill_Color: Find colors of Internal_Influencers. Apply priority Green(3)>Magenta(6)>Azure(8). Default Azure(8).
  - Apply_Voronoi_Fill: Calculate nearest External_Seed for each Reachable_White pixel (Manhattan, row/col tie-break) and assign its color.
  - Apply_Transformations: Update pixel colors in output grid: Walls change to determined Wall_Color, Enclosed_White change to determined Fill_Color, Reachable_White change via Voronoi. Seeds and Influencers retain original colors unless overwritten.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored based on transformation rules.
  - No_Background: Original White(0) pixels are filled.
  - Transformed_Regions: Walls change color, enclosed/reachable areas are filled.

## Natural Language Program (Based on Strategy 3.0)

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid for modification. Identify the grid dimensions (rows, cols).
2.  **Identify Reachable Area:** Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all non-blue(1) border pixels. The BFS can only traverse non-blue(1) pixels. Mark all visited pixels (including the starting border pixels) as 'reachable'. Blue(1) pixels are never marked reachable.
3.  **Categorize Pixels & Identify Influencers/Seeds:**
    a.  Initialize empty lists: `internal_influencers`, `external_seeds`.
    b.  Initialize boolean flag `has_red_influencer = False`.
    c.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` of the input grid:
        i.  Get the pixel's color `c_color`.
        ii. If `c_color` is Blue(1), skip (handled later).
        iii. If `c_color` is White(0), skip (handled later).
        iv. **(Active Pixel):** Check if `(r, c)` is marked 'reachable'.
        v.  Check if `(r, c)` is 4-directionally adjacent to any Blue(1) pixel.
        vi. If the pixel is **not reachable** OR it **is adjacent to a blue wall**:
            *   Add its info (`pos`, `color`) to `internal_influencers`.
            *   If `c_color` is Red(2), set `has_red_influencer = True`.
        vii. Else (if the pixel **is reachable** AND **not adjacent to a blue wall**):
            *   Add its info (`pos`, `color`) to `external_seeds`.
4.  **Determine Wall Transformation Color:** If `has_red_influencer` is true, `wall_color = Red(2)`. Otherwise, `wall_color = Azure(8)`.
5.  **Determine Enclosed Fill Color:**
    a.  Collect the set of unique colors from `internal_influencers`.
    b.  If Green(3) is in the set, `fill_color = Green(3)`.
    c.  Else if Magenta(6) is in the set, `fill_color = Magenta(6)`.
    d.  Else if Azure(8) is in the set, `fill_color = Azure(8)`.
    e.  Else (no priority colors found among influencers), `fill_color = Azure(8)`.
6.  **Apply Transformations to Output Grid:**
    a.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)`:
        i.  Get the original `input_color` at `(r, c)`.
        ii. If `input_color` was Blue(1), set the output grid at `(r, c)` to `wall_color`.
        iii. If `input_color` was White(0):
            *   Check if `(r, c)` was marked 'reachable'.
            *   If **not reachable**: Set output grid at `(r, c)` to `fill_color`.
            *   If **reachable**:
                1.  If `external_seeds` is empty, leave the color unchanged (or set to a default like 0 or handle as error - examples imply seeds exist if reachable white exists). Assume seeds exist based on examples.
                2.  Calculate Manhattan distance from `(r, c)` to every seed in `external_seeds`.
                3.  Find the minimum distance.
                4.  Identify all seeds at that minimum distance.
                5.  Select the seed with the minimum row index; if tied, use the minimum column index.
                6.  Set output grid at `(r, c)` to the color of the selected nearest seed.
        iv. Else (original pixel was an active color, non-blue, non-white): The output grid already holds its original color from the initial copy. Do nothing.
7.  **Return:** Return the modified output grid.
