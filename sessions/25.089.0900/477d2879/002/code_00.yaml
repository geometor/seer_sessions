Task: Voronoi fill and container transformation based on pixel roles.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Wall_Color: Blue (1).
  - Active_Pixels: All non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels in the input.

Derived_Objects_and_Properties:
  - Blue_Components: Connected components of Blue(1) pixels (walls).
  - Active_Pixel_Roles: Each Active_Pixel is categorized based on relation to Blue_Components:
      - Strictly_Enclosed: Active_Pixel cannot reach grid border without crossing Blue(1).
      - Adjacent: Active_Pixel is not Strictly_Enclosed but is 4-neighbor to a Blue(1) pixel.
      - External: Active_Pixel is neither Strictly_Enclosed nor Adjacent.
  - Enclosed_Region: The set of all pixels (White(0) or Active) that are Strictly_Enclosed by a specific Blue_Component.
  - Wall_Influencers: Set of colors of Active_Pixels that are Strictly_Enclosed or Adjacent to a specific Blue_Component.
  - Fill_Influencers: Set of colors of Active_Pixels that are Strictly_Enclosed by a specific Blue_Component. If empty, use colors of Adjacent Active_Pixels instead.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Grid structure, adjacency (4-neighbor), distance (Manhattan).
  - Containment: Blue_Components enclose Enclosed_Regions.
  - Association: Active_Pixels are associated with Blue_Components based on enclosure or adjacency.
  - Influence:
      - External Active_Pixels act as seeds for Voronoi fill of non-enclosed White(0) pixels.
      - Wall_Influencers determine the transformation of Blue(1) pixels.
      - Fill_Influencers determine the fill color for enclosed White(0) pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Components: Find connected Blue_Components.
  - Determine_Reachability: Identify all pixels reachable from the border without crossing Blue(1).
  - Categorize_Active_Pixels: Assign roles (Strictly_Enclosed, Adjacent, External) to each Active_Pixel. Associate influencers with Blue_Components.
  - Calculate_Voronoi_Fill: Fill reachable White(0) pixels based on nearest External Active_Pixel (Manhattan distance, tie-break row then column).
  - Determine_Wall_Transformation: For each Blue_Component, apply the rule: Red(2) if Red(2) is the only non-Azure(8) color in Wall_Influencers, else Azure(8).
  - Determine_Enclosed_Fill: For each Blue_Component, find the Fill_Influencers. Apply color priority Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8). Default to Azure(8) if none present.
  - Apply_Transformations: Combine Voronoi fill, Wall Transformation, and Enclosed Fill into the final output grid. Active_Pixels retain their original color unless overwritten by a wall transformation (which shouldn't happen if partitioning is correct).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored.
  - Transformed_Walls: Original Blue(1) pixels changed based on Wall_Influencers.
  - Filled_Enclosed_Area: Original White(0) pixels in Enclosed_Regions filled based on Fill_Influencers.
  - Filled_Outside_Area: Original White(0) pixels not in Enclosed_Regions filled by Voronoi based on External Active_Pixels.
  - Preserved_Active_Pixels: Active_Pixels retain their original color.
