Task: Color filling based on partitioning by blue walls.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Wall_Color: Blue (1).
  - Active_Pixels: All non-White(0), non-Blue(1) pixels.

Regions:
  - Reachable_Area: Pixels (including White(0)) connected to the grid border without crossing Blue(1) walls.
  - Enclosed_Area: Pixels (including White(0)) not connected to the grid border (separated by Blue(1) walls).

Categorized_Active_Pixels:
  - External_Seeds: Active_Pixels located in the Reachable_Area AND not 4-directionally adjacent to any Blue(1) pixel.
  - Internal_Influencers: Active_Pixels located in the Enclosed_Area.
  - Adjacent_Active_Pixels: Active_Pixels located in the Reachable_Area AND 4-directionally adjacent to a Blue(1) pixel. (Note: role in transformation is unclear, potentially influence wall color alongside Internal_Influencers adjacent to walls).

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Grid structure, adjacency (4-directional), distance (Manhattan).
  - Containment: Blue(1) walls define Reachable vs. Enclosed Areas.
  - Proximity: Reachable White(0) pixels are associated with the nearest External_Seed.
  - Adjacency_to_Wall: Key for determining Wall_Color transformation (specifically for Red(2)).

Actions:
  - Partition_Grid: Identify Reachable_Area and Enclosed_Area using connectivity analysis (e.g., BFS from border avoiding Blue(1)).
  - Categorize_Pixels: Assign each Active_Pixel to one category: External_Seed, Internal_Influencer, or Adjacent_Active_Pixel.
  - Determine_Wall_Color:
      - Check if any Internal_Influencer with color Red(2) is 4-directionally adjacent to any Blue(1) pixel.
      - If yes, the target Wall_Color is Red(2).
      - Otherwise, the target Wall_Color is Azure(8).
  - Determine_Fill_Color:
      - Collect colors of all Internal_Influencers.
      - Apply priority: If Green(3) is present, Fill_Color is Green(3). Else if Magenta(6) is present, Fill_Color is Magenta(6). Else (if Azure(8) or others are present, or none), Fill_Color is Azure(8).
  - Perform_Voronoi_Fill:
      - For each White(0) pixel in the Reachable_Area:
          - Find the External_Seed(s) with the minimum Manhattan distance.
          - Tie-break using minimum row index, then minimum column index.
          - Set the pixel's color to the chosen External_Seed's color.
  - Apply_Transformations:
      - Create an output grid initialized from the input.
      - Change all original Blue(1) pixels to the determined Wall_Color.
      - Change all original White(0) pixels in the Enclosed_Area to the determined Fill_Color.
      - Change all original White(0) pixels in the Reachable_Area based on the Voronoi_Fill.
      - Preserve the original colors of all Active_Pixels.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored (no White(0)).
  - Transformed_Walls: Original Blue(1) pixels are now Wall_Color.
  - Filled_Enclosed_Areas: Original White(0) enclosed pixels are now Fill_Color.
  - Filled_Reachable_Areas: Original White(0) reachable pixels are now colored based on nearest External_Seed.
