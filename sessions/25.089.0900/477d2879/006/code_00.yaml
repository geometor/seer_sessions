Task: Grid transformation based on partitioning relative to blue walls.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Wall_Color: Blue (1).
  - Active_Pixels: Non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels.

Derived_Concepts:
  - Reachable_Mask: Boolean mask indicating pixels reachable from border via BFS without crossing Wall_Color pixels.
  - Adjacency_To_Wall: Boolean concept indicating if a pixel is 4-directionally adjacent to any Wall_Color pixel.

Pixel_Roles:
  - Walls: Pixels with Wall_Color(1).
  - Internal_Influencers: Active_Pixels that are either NOT reachable (per Reachable_Mask) OR are Adjacent_To_Wall.
  - External_Seeds: Active_Pixels that ARE reachable AND are NOT Adjacent_To_Wall.
  - Enclosed_White: White(0) pixels that are NOT reachable.
  - Reachable_White: White(0) pixels that ARE reachable.

Relationships:
  - Containment: Implicitly defined by Walls partitioning the grid into reachable/unreachable areas.
  - Proximity: Manhattan distance used for Voronoi fill from External_Seeds. Adjacency used for Internal_Influencer definition and Wall Color rule.
  - Influence:
      - External_Seeds determine color of Reachable_White pixels via Voronoi.
      - Internal_Influencers determine Wall color transformation (presence/absence of adjacent Red(2)).
      - Internal_Influencers determine fill color for Enclosed_White pixels (priority Green>Magenta>Azure).

Actions:
  - Partition: Calculate Reachable_Mask using BFS from border avoiding Walls.
  - Categorize: Assign Roles (Wall, Internal_Influencer, External_Seed, Enclosed_White, Reachable_White) to each pixel based on color, reachability, and adjacency to walls.
  - Determine_Wall_Color: Check if any Internal_Influencer is Red(2). If yes, target color is Red(2), else Azure(8).
  - Determine_Fill_Color: Find colors of Internal_Influencers. Apply priority Green(3)>Magenta(6)>Azure(8). Default Azure(8).
  - Apply_Voronoi_Fill: Calculate nearest External_Seed for each Reachable_White pixel (Manhattan, row/col tie-break) and assign its color.
  - Apply_Transformations: Update pixel colors in output grid: Walls change to determined Wall_Color, Enclosed_White change to determined Fill_Color, Reachable_White change via Voronoi. Seeds and Influencers retain original colors unless overwritten.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored based on transformation rules.
  - No_Background: Original White(0) pixels are filled.
  - Transformed_Regions: Walls change color, enclosed/reachable areas are filled.
