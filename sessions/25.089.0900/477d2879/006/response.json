            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous attempt failed significantly on all examples, indicating fundamental misunderstandings of the transformation rules, particularly concerning:\n\n1.  **Seed Identification:** The criteria for identifying 'seed' pixels for the Voronoi fill were too restrictive. The code incorrectly excluded reachable pixels adjacent to the blue walls.\n2.  **Wall Color Transformation:** The condition for changing blue walls to red was misidentified. It's not just the presence of *any* internal red pixel, but specifically an *internal red pixel adjacent to the wall*.\n3.  **Region Definition:** While the basic reachability check (BFS from border avoiding blue) seems sound, the subsequent categorization and use of 'reachable' vs 'enclosed' pixels, especially those adjacent to walls, were flawed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Pixel Roles:** Clearly define pixel categories based on reachability *and* color:\n    *   `Wall`: Original Blue(1) pixels.\n    *   `Reachable White`: White(0) pixels reachable from the border without crossing walls.\n    *   `Enclosed White`: White(0) pixels *not* reachable.\n    *   `Seeds`: *All* non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels that are reachable. Adjacency to walls is irrelevant for seed status.\n    *   `Internal Colors`: Non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels that are *not* reachable.\n2.  **Refine Rules based on Re-evaluation:**\n    *   **Voronoi Fill:** Use *all* `Seeds` for filling `Reachable White` areas (Manhattan distance, row/col tie-break).\n    *   **Wall Color:** Change `Wall` pixels to Red(2) *if and only if* there exists at least one `Internal Color` pixel that is Red(2) *and* is 4-directionally adjacent to *any* `Wall` pixel. Otherwise, change `Wall` pixels to Azure(8).\n    *   **Enclosed Fill:** Fill `Enclosed White` pixels based on the set of colors present among *all* `Internal Colors`. Use priority: Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8). If none of these are present, default to Azure(8).\n3.  **Verify with Metrics:** Use code execution to confirm the pixel categorizations and rule applications for each training example based on the refined understanding.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's re-analyze pixel roles using the refined definitions.\n\n"

It identified *all* non-zero, non-blue pixels as 'Seeds' and found *no* 'Internal Colors' in any example. This contradicts the visual inspection and the expected output transformations.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   Example 1: Red(2) at (5,2) and Azure(8) at (5,6) are clearly inside the blue boundary and should be 'Internal', not 'Seeds'. The wall color should be Red(2), and the fill should be Azure(8).\n*   Example 2: Magenta(6) at (7,9) is clearly internal. The wall color should be Azure(8), and the fill should be Magenta(6).\n*   Example 3: Green(3) at (5,5) and Red(2) at (10,3) are clearly internal. The wall color should be Red(2) (because internal Red(2) at (10,3) is adjacent to wall at (10,2)), and the fill should be Green(3).\n\n**Revised Strategy Adjustment:**\n\nThe `_find_reachable_pixels` BFS needs to correctly identify *only* the background area. Pixels are 'internal' if they are *not* blue(1) and *not* reachable via the BFS starting from the border.\n\nLet's retry the metric gathering with a focus on ensuring the BFS correctly partitions the grid. The BFS *must* start only from border cells and *stop* at blue(1) walls. Any non-blue cell not visited by the BFS is enclosed.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Second Metric Results:**\n\nThe BFS is still not correctly partitioning the grid. It seems the BFS is escaping the intended enclosed areas. Let's rethink the BFS logic: it should only add neighbors if they are *within bounds*, *not already visited*, AND *not a wall (blue=1)*. The current code implements this. Why isn't it working as expected?\n\nCould the issue be that some \"internal\" pixels are actually reachable because the \"wall\" is incomplete or has gaps?\n\n*   Ex 1: Walls seem closed. Pixel (5,2)=Red is inside. Neighbors: (4,2)=Blue, (6,2)=Blue, (5,1)=White, (5,3)=White. (5,1) is reachable from border. (5,3) is reachable. BFS path: (0,0) -> ... -> (5,1) -> (5,2). Yes, the BFS can reach (5,2) because the wall doesn't fully enclose it from the background. Same for (5,6)=Azure. Path: (0,0) -> ... -> (4,6)=White -> (5,6).\n\nThis means the definition of \"enclosed\" cannot rely solely on the BFS reachability from the *outside*. A region is enclosed if it's surrounded by blue walls. We might need a different approach, perhaps using connected components *after* identifying walls.\n\n**Revised Strategy 2.0:**\n\n1.  **Identify Walls:** Find all Blue(1) pixels.\n2.  **Identify Connected Components (Non-Walls):** Find all connected components (4-directional) of non-blue pixels.\n3.  **Identify Outside Component:** The component containing border pixels is the 'outside' or 'reachable' region.\n4.  **Identify Inside Components:** All other non-wall components are 'inside' or 'enclosed'.\n5.  **Categorize Pixels:**\n    *   `Wall`: Original Blue(1) pixels.\n    *   `Reachable White`: White(0) pixels in the 'outside' component.\n    *   `Enclosed White`: White(0) pixels in any 'inside' component.\n    *   `Seeds`: Non-white(0) pixels in the 'outside' component.\n    *   `Internal Colors`: Non-white(0) pixels in any 'inside' component.\n6.  **Apply Rules (as refined previously):**\n    *   Voronoi fill for `Reachable White` using `Seeds`.\n    *   Wall color based on adjacency of Red(2) `Internal Colors` to `Wall` pixels.\n    *   Enclosed fill for `Enclosed White` based on `Internal Colors` (priority Green>Magenta>Azure).\n\nLet's perform this analysis manually on Example 1:\n*   Walls: Identified.\n*   Components: Component 1 (Outside): Contains (0,0) and all background pixels, plus (1,10)=Green, (5,2)=Red, (5,6)=Azure. Component 2 (Inside): Contains only white pixels, e.g., (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), etc.\n*   Categories:\n    *   Walls: Blue pixels.\n    *   Reachable White: Background white pixels.\n    *   Enclosed White: White pixels like (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), etc.\n    *   Seeds: Green(3)@(1,10), Red(2)@(5,2), Azure(8)@(5,6).\n    *   Internal Colors: None.\n*   Rule Application:\n    *   Wall Color: No internal Red(2) adjacent -> Wall becomes Azure(8). (Mismatch with expected output!)\n    *   Enclosed Fill: No internal colors -> Fill becomes Azure(8). (Mismatch with expected output!)\n    *   Voronoi: Seeds are Green(3), Red(2), Azure(8). Fill depends on nearest. (Mismatch!)\n\n**Conclusion:** The simple connected components approach also fails to replicate Example 1's output. The core issue seems to be the definition of what constitutes the \"inside\" vs \"outside\" influence.\n\nLet's reconsider the first approach (BFS reachability) but refine the *interpretation*. What if pixels like Red(2)@(5,2) and Azure(8)@(5,6) in Ex1 *act* as internal influencers for the wall/fill *even though they are technically reachable by the BFS*? Perhaps adjacency to the wall makes them act \"internal\" for rule purposes?\n\n**Revised Strategy 3.0 (Hybrid):**\n\n1.  **Identify Reachability:** Use BFS from border avoiding walls (`_find_reachable_pixels`). Mark reachable non-wall pixels.\n2.  **Categorize Active Pixels (Non-0, Non-1):**\n    *   `Internal Influencers`: *All* active pixels that are 4-directionally adjacent to *any* Blue(1) wall pixel, OR are *not* reachable by the BFS.\n    *   `External Seeds`: All active pixels that are reachable by BFS AND are *not* adjacent to any Blue(1) wall pixel.\n3.  **Categorize White Pixels:**\n    *   `Reachable White`: White(0) reachable by BFS.\n    *   `Enclosed White`: White(0) not reachable by BFS.\n4.  **Determine Wall Color:** Walls (Blue(1)) become Red(2) if *any* `Internal Influencer` is Red(2). Otherwise, Walls become Azure(8). (Simplified adjacency check - if it's an influencer and Red, it counts).\n5.  **Determine Fill Color:** Fill `Enclosed White` pixels based on colors of `Internal Influencers` (Priority: Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)). Default Azure(8).\n6.  **Fill Reachable Area:** Fill `Reachable White` using Voronoi based on `External Seeds` only.\n7.  **Final Colors:** Active pixels keep original colors unless overwritten by Wall/Fill.\n\nLet's test Strategy 3.0 manually on examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Reachable: BFS marks background white, plus Green(3)@(1,10), Red(2)@(5,2), Azure(8)@(5,6).\n    *   Internal Influencers: Red(2)@(5,2) (adjacent to wall), Azure(8)@(5,6) (adjacent to wall).\n    *   External Seeds: Green(3)@(1,10) (reachable, not adjacent).\n    *   Enclosed White: Pixels like (3,5), (3,6), etc.\n    *   Wall Color: Internal Influencers include Red(2). Wall -> Red(2). (Matches!)\n    *   Fill Color: Internal Influencers {Red(2), Azure(8)}. Priority -> Azure(8). (Matches!)\n    *   Voronoi: Seed is Green(3). Fill -> Green(3). (Matches!)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Reachable: Background white, plus Red(2)@(1,1), Green(3)@(1,3), Azure(8)@(1,9), Magenta(6)@(7,9), Orange(7)@(8,1), Yellow(4)@(12,5).\n    *   Internal Influencers: Azure(8)@(1,9) (adjacent), Magenta(6)@(7,9) (adjacent).\n    *   External Seeds: Red(2)@(1,1), Green(3)@(1,3), Orange(7)@(8,1), Yellow(4)@(12,5).\n    *   Enclosed White: e.g., (2,4), (2,5), etc.\n    *   Wall Color: Internal Influencers {Azure(8), Magenta(6)}. No Red(2). Wall -> Azure(8). (Matches!)\n    *   Fill Color: Internal Influencers {Azure(8), Magenta(6)}. Priority -> Magenta(6). (Matches!)\n    *   Voronoi: Seeds {Red(2), Green(3), Orange(7), Yellow(4)}. (Matches expected pattern!)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Reachable: Background white, plus Maroon(9)@(0,2), Magenta(6)@(2,2), Azure(8)@(5,1), Green(3)@(5,5), Azure(8)@(6,8), Red(2)@(10,3), Orange(7)@(12,0).\n    *   Internal Influencers: Magenta(6)@(2,2) (adjacent), Azure(8)@(5,1) (adjacent), Green(3)@(5,5) (adjacent), Azure(8)@(6,8) (adjacent), Red(2)@(10,3) (adjacent).\n    *   External Seeds: Maroon(9)@(0,2), Orange(7)@(12,0).\n    *   Enclosed White: e.g., (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n    *   Wall Color: Internal Influencers include Red(2). Wall -> Red(2). (Matches!)\n    *   Fill Color: Internal Influencers {Magenta(6), Azure(8), Green(3), Red(2)}. Priority -> Green(3). (Matches!)\n    *   Voronoi: Seeds {Maroon(9), Orange(7)}. (Matches expected pattern!)\n\nStrategy 3.0 seems consistent with all examples.\n\n## YAML Facts Documentation (Based on Strategy 3.0)\n\n"
