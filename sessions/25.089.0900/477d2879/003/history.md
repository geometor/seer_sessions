Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels (0-9). The size remains the same between input and output (13x13 in all examples).
2.  **Background:** The input grids have a white (0) background. The output grids are completely filled with non-white colors.
3.  **Key Input Components:**
    *   **Blue Shapes (Color 1):** There are distinct shapes made of blue pixels. These shapes act like containers or walls.
    *   **Internal Pixels:** Inside the blue shapes, there can be white pixels (0) or other colored pixels (e.g., red, azure, magenta, green).
    *   **External "Seed" Pixels:** There are isolated non-white pixels located outside the blue shapes, on the white background.
4.  **Transformation - Background:** The white background pixels in the input are filled in the output. The fill color for any given background pixel seems to be determined by the color of the nearest "seed" pixel (using Manhattan distance). This resembles a Voronoi tessellation based on the seed pixels. Tie-breaking likely uses row/column order.
5.  **Transformation - Blue Shapes:**
    *   The blue (1) pixels themselves change color. This new color seems dependent on the colors of the *internal* pixels enclosed by the blue shape. If an internal red (2) pixel exists, the blue pixels become red (2) (Example 1). Otherwise, they become azure (8) (Examples 2 and 3).
    *   The white (0) pixels *enclosed* by the blue shapes are also filled. The fill color depends on the internal non-blue pixels present: Green (3) takes precedence, then Magenta (6), then Azure (8). (Ex3: internal 3,6,8 -> fill 3; Ex2: internal 6,8 -> fill 6; Ex1: internal 2,8 -> fill 8).
    *   The non-white, non-blue pixels *enclosed* by the blue shapes retain their original color in the output.
6.  **Object Interaction:** The blue shapes act as barriers defining distinct "inside" and "outside" regions. The external seeds influence the outside fill, while the internal pixels influence the transformation of the container (blue shape) itself and the fill color of the enclosed white space.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
Task: Fill grid based on region type (outside vs inside blue shapes)

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Container_Color: Blue (1).
  - Objects:
      - Containers: Connected components of Blue(1) pixels.
      - Seeds: Non-white pixels (not Blue(1)) located on the Background(0) and not enclosed by Containers.
      - Enclosed_Pixels: Pixels (White(0) or other colors) spatially enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_White: White(0) pixels enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_Internal: Non-white, non-blue pixels enclosed by Containers.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels are arranged in a grid. Adjacency and distance (Manhattan) are important.
  - Containment: Blue(1) shapes enclose other pixels.
  - Proximity: Background(0) pixels are associated with the nearest Seed pixel.
  - Influence:
      - Seed colors determine the fill color for Background(0) pixels.
      - Enclosed_Internal colors determine the transformation of Container pixels and the fill color for Enclosed_White pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Regions: Differentiate between Background, Containers, Seeds, and Enclosed pixels.
  - Determine_Reachability: Identify which pixels can reach the grid border without crossing Blue(1) pixels (these are Background or Seeds). Pixels that cannot reach are Enclosed.
  - Calculate_Distances: Compute Manhattan distance from Background pixels to Seed pixels.
  - Apply_Voronoi_Fill: Fill reachable Background(0) pixels with the color of the nearest Seed (tie-break by row, then column).
  - Transform_Containers:
      - Change color of Container(Blue=1) pixels based on presence of Red(2) among Enclosed_Internal pixels (if Red(2) present -> Red(2), else -> Azure(8)).
      - Fill Enclosed_White pixels based on priority of Enclosed_Internal colors (Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)).
  - Preserve_Colors: Seed pixels and Enclosed_Internal pixels keep their original colors.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored.
  - No_Background: White(0) pixels are eliminated (either filled by Voronoi or Container transformation).
  - Transformed_Regions: Original regions are replaced by new colors based on the rules.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:**
    a.  Find all connected components of blue (1) pixels. These are the "containers".
    b.  Determine which non-blue pixels can reach the grid border by only traversing non-blue pixels (using a flood fill or BFS starting from all border non-blue cells). Mark these as "reachable".
    c.  Identify "seed" pixels: These are the non-white, non-blue pixels marked as "reachable".
    d.  Identify "enclosed" pixels: These are all non-blue pixels *not* marked as "reachable".
3.  **Fill Background:**
    a.  For each pixel (r, c) that is white (0) in the input and marked as "reachable":
        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance to all identified "seed" pixels.
        ii. Find the minimum distance.
        iii. Identify all seeds at that minimum distance.
        iv. Select the seed with the lowest row index. If there's still a tie, select the one with the lowest column index.
        v.  Set the color of the pixel (r, c) in the output grid to the color of the selected nearest seed.
4.  **Transform Containers:**
    a.  For each identified blue container:
        i.  Find all "enclosed" pixels that are adjacent to this container or spatially inside it.
        ii. Collect the set of colors of the enclosed pixels that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1). Call this set `internal_colors`.
        iii. Determine the `fill_color` for enclosed white pixels: If Green(3) is in `internal_colors`, use Green(3). Else if Magenta(6) is in `internal_colors`, use Magenta(6). Else if Azure(8) is in `internal_colors`, use Azure(8). (Assume one of these will be present based on examples).
        iv. Determine the `wall_color` for the container's blue pixels: If Red(2) is in `internal_colors`, use Red(2). Otherwise, use Azure(8).
        v.  Update the output grid:
            1.  For every pixel (r, c) that was part of this container (blue=1 in input), set its color to `wall_color`.
            2.  For every pixel (r, c) that was white (0) in the input and is identified as enclosed within this container, set its color to `fill_color`.
5.  **Finalize:** The output grid now contains the transformed colors. Seed pixels and original enclosed internal pixels have retained their colors from the initial copy.

## General Assessment

The initial code failed primarily because the logic for filling the 'outside' area (pixels reachable from the border without crossing blue walls) was incorrect. The assumption of a standard Voronoi fill based only on 'seed' pixels in the reachable area did not match Example 1, and potentially others. The transformation logic for the blue 'container' walls and the 'enclosed' white pixels seemed more promising but also had inconsistencies (e.g., Example 1 wall color).

The errors suggest a need to refine:
1.  **Definition of Regions:** Precisely defining 'outside' (reachable), 'inside' (enclosed), and the pixels influencing each ('seeds' vs 'internal colors').
2.  **Filling Logic:** The 'outside' fill seems to be a global Voronoi pattern based on *all* non-white, non-blue pixels, which is then potentially clipped or overridden by the container transformations.
3.  **Container Transformation Logic:** The rules for determining wall color and internal fill color need to be robustly linked to the specific non-white, non-blue pixels associated with that container.

**Strategy:**
1.  Implement a global Voronoi fill based on *all* non-white, non-blue pixels as a base layer.
2.  Identify blue wall components and the pixels they enclose (both white and non-white).
3.  For each enclosed region, determine its 'internal colors' (the non-white, non-blue pixels enclosed or immediately adjacent).
4.  Apply the derived rules for changing wall colors and filling enclosed white pixels, overwriting the base Voronoi layer where necessary.
5.  Use code execution to verify the intermediate steps (Voronoi pattern, enclosed regions, internal colors) against the examples.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the inputs and expected outputs more closely, focusing on the relationship between all non-white, non-blue pixels ("active pixels") and the final grid.

**Example 1:**
- Input Grid Size: 13x13
- Active Pixels (Color @ (Row, Col)): Green(3)@(1,10), Red(2)@(5,2), Azure(8)@(5,6)
- Blue Wall Pixels: Form a complex shape.
- Enclosed Pixels (Input): White(0) pixels and possibly A(5,6)? Let's re-verify A(5,6)'s reachability.
- Expected Output Outside Fill: Uniformly Green(3).
- Expected Output Wall Color: Red(2).
- Expected Output Enclosed Fill: Azure(8).

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Ex1 Reachability:
G(3)@(1,10): True
R(2)@(5,2): True
A(8)@(5,6): True
W(0)@(3,5): True

```
**Analysis of Code Execution 1:** The reachability calculation shows that *all* active pixels (G, R, A) and even some pixels expected to be enclosed (like W(0)@(3,5)) are reachable from the border in Example 1. This contradicts the visual interpretation and the expected output. The `_find_reachable_pixels` function likely has a flaw or the definition of "enclosed" is different.

Let's rethink "enclosed". Maybe it's not about border reachability, but about being inside the "bounding box" of a blue shape and not being blue itself? Or perhaps using 8-connectivity for reachability?

Let's assume the visual interpretation holds: the area clearly inside the blue shape is 'enclosed'.
- Ex1 Enclosed Active Pixels: None. The R(2) and A(8) are adjacent but outside the main loop.
- Ex1 Internal Colors (based on adjacency): R(2), A(8).
- Wall Color Rule: If R(2) adjacent -> R(2). Matches expected.
- Fill Color Rule: Prioritize G(3)>M(6)>A(8) among adjacent/enclosed. Here, only A(8) applies. Fill=A(8). Matches expected.

Now, why is the *outside* fill Green(3)? This still contradicts the Voronoi based on R(2), G(3), A(8). What if the R(2) and A(8) are *not* considered seeds for the outside fill because they are involved in the container transformation?
**Hypothesis 2:**
1.  Identify blue walls and the enclosed regions.
2.  Identify all non-white, non-blue pixels ('active pixels').
3.  Partition 'active pixels' into 'internal/adjacent' (influencing wall/fill) and 'external seeds' (influencing outside fill). An active pixel is internal/adjacent if it's enclosed or next to a blue wall pixel.
4.  Determine wall/fill colors based on 'internal/adjacent' active pixels.
5.  Perform Voronoi fill on reachable white pixels based *only* on 'external seeds'.

Let's test Hypothesis 2 on Ex1:
1.  Walls/Enclosed: Identified visually.
2.  Active: G(1,10), R(5,2), A(5,6).
3.  Partition: R(5,2) is next to blue. A(5,6) is next to blue. G(1,10) is not next to blue. -> Internal/Adjacent: {R(2), A(8)}. External Seeds: {G(3)}.
4.  Wall/Fill: Based on {R(2), A(8)} -> Wall=R(2), Fill=A(8). Matches.
5.  Outside Fill: Voronoi based on {G(3)}. -> All outside becomes Green(3). Matches.

Let's test Hypothesis 2 on Ex2:
1.  Walls/Enclosed: Identified visually. M(7,9) is enclosed. A(1,9) is adjacent.
2.  Active: R(1,1), G(1,3), A(1,9), O(8,1), Y(12,5), M(7,9).
3.  Partition:
    *   R(1,1): Adjacent to blue. -> Internal/Adj.
    *   G(1,3): Adjacent to blue. -> Internal/Adj.
    *   A(1,9): Adjacent to blue. -> Internal/Adj.
    *   O(8,1): Not adjacent. -> External Seed.
    *   Y(12,5): Not adjacent. -> External Seed.
    *   M(7,9): Enclosed/Adjacent. -> Internal/Adj.
    *   Internal/Adjacent: {R(2), G(3), A(8), M(6)}. External Seeds: {O(7), Y(4)}.
4.  Wall/Fill: Based on {R(2), G(3), A(8), M(6)}. R(2) is present -> Wall=R(2). Expected Wall=A(8). -> **Hypothesis 2 Fails.**

**Let's reconsider the Wall Color Rule:** Maybe it's not just the presence of Red(2)?
- Ex1: Internal/Adj={R(2), A(8)}. Wall=R(2).
- Ex2: Internal/Adj={R(2), G(3), A(8), M(6)}. Wall=A(8).
- Ex3: (Assuming similar adjacency partitioning) Internal/Adj={M(6), G(3), A(8), R(2)}. Wall=A(8). (Need to verify adjacency for Ex3).

The wall becomes Red(2) *only* if Red(2) is the *only* non-Azure(8) internal/adjacent color?
- Ex1: Non-Azure colors = {R(2)}. Wall=R(2). Fits.
- Ex2: Non-Azure colors = {R(2), G(3), M(6)}. Not just R(2). Wall=A(8). Fits.
- Ex3: Non-Azure colors = {M(6), G(3), R(2)}. Not just R(2). Wall=A(8). Fits.
**Revised Wall Rule:** Wall becomes Red(2) iff Red(2) is present in Internal/Adjacent colors AND no other colors except potentially Azure(8) are present. Otherwise, Wall becomes Azure(8).

**Let's retry Hypothesis 2 with the Revised Wall Rule:**

Test on Ex2:
1. Walls/Enclosed: ok
2. Active: R(1,1), G(1,3), A(1,9), O(8,1), Y(12,5), M(7,9).
3. Partition: Internal/Adj={R(2), G(3), A(8), M(6)}. External Seeds: {O(7), Y(4)}.
4. Wall/Fill:
    *   Wall: Internal/Adj={2,3,8,6}. Non-Azure={2,3,6}. R(2) is present, but others (3,6) are too. Rule -> Wall=A(8). Matches expected.
    *   Fill: Internal/Adj={2,3,8,6}. Priority G(3)>M(6)>A(8). G(3) is present. Rule -> Fill=G(3). Expected Fill=M(6). -> **Hypothesis 2 Still Fails.**

**Problem:** The Fill Color logic seems wrong, or the partitioning is wrong. Why is Ex2 Fill M(6) when G(3) is supposedly adjacent? Let's check G(1,3)'s adjacency. Yes, it's next to blue at (1,4). R(1,1) is next to blue at (2,1). A(1,9) next to blue at (1,8). M(7,9) is enclosed.

Maybe the 'Internal/Adjacent' set for Fill calculation is different from the Wall calculation? Or the priority is wrong?
- Ex1: Internal/Adj={R(2), A(8)}. Priority G>M>A -> Fill=A(8). Correct.
- Ex2: Internal/Adj={R(2), G(3), A(8), M(6)}. Priority G>M>A -> Fill=G(3). Incorrect (Expected M(6)).
- Ex3: Internal/Adj={M(6), G(3), A(8), R(2)}. Priority G>M>A -> Fill=G(3). Correct.

Why does Ex2 break the Fill priority? Could G(3) at (1,3) not be considered 'internal/adjacent' *for the fill rule*? It's adjacent to the top-left blue segment, which seems to only enclose white space. The main enclosed area contains M(7,9). What if the Fill color is determined *only* by active pixels *strictly inside* the enclosed area?
- Ex1: Strictly Inside = {}. Default fill? Let's use Adjacent for fill if Inside is empty. Adjacent = {R(2), A(8)}. Fill=A(8). Correct.
- Ex2: Strictly Inside = {M(6)}. Adjacent = {R(2), G(3), A(8)}. Use Strictly Inside -> Fill=M(6). Correct.
- Ex3: Strictly Inside = {G(3), A(8)}. Adjacent = {M(6), R(2)}. Use Strictly Inside -> Fill=G(3). Correct.

**Hypothesis 3 (Refined Logic):**
1.  Identify blue wall components (connected components of 1s).
2.  Identify all non-white, non-blue pixels ('active pixels').
3.  **Partitioning:** For each active pixel, determine if it is:
    a.  **Strictly Enclosed:** Cannot reach border without crossing blue AND is not blue. (Need a robust `is_enclosed` check).
    b.  **Adjacent:** Not strictly enclosed, but has a blue pixel as a 4-neighbor.
    c.  **External:** Neither strictly enclosed nor adjacent.
4.  **Wall Color:** For each blue component, find all *Adjacent* and *Strictly Enclosed* active pixels associated with it. Let this set be `Wall_Influencers`. Wall becomes Red(2) iff Red(2) is in `Wall_Influencers` AND no other colors except potentially Azure(8) are present. Otherwise, Wall becomes Azure(8).
5.  **Fill Color:** For each blue component, find all *Strictly Enclosed* active pixels associated with it. Let this set be `Fill_Influencers`. If `Fill_Influencers` is empty, use the *Adjacent* active pixels instead. Determine Fill Color by priority: Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8). If none of these are present in the chosen set, default to Azure(8)? (Based on Ex1, default seems to be Azure(8)).
6.  **Outside Fill:** Perform Voronoi fill for all white pixels that are not Strictly Enclosed, using only the *External* active pixels as seeds (tie-break row, then column).
7.  **Assembly:** Start with a copy of the input. Apply Voronoi fill (Step 6). Update blue pixels to Wall Color (Step 4). Update Strictly Enclosed white pixels to Fill Color (Step 5).

This seems complex but covers all observed behaviors. Need a good way to implement `is_enclosed` and associate influencers with specific blue components if there are multiple. For now, assume a single connected enclosed area per example.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
Task: Voronoi fill and container transformation based on pixel roles.

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Wall_Color: Blue (1).
  - Active_Pixels: All non-white(0), non-blue(1) pixels in the input.

Derived_Objects_and_Properties:
  - Blue_Components: Connected components of Blue(1) pixels (walls).
  - Active_Pixel_Roles: Each Active_Pixel is categorized based on relation to Blue_Components:
      - Strictly_Enclosed: Active_Pixel cannot reach grid border without crossing Blue(1).
      - Adjacent: Active_Pixel is not Strictly_Enclosed but is 4-neighbor to a Blue(1) pixel.
      - External: Active_Pixel is neither Strictly_Enclosed nor Adjacent.
  - Enclosed_Region: The set of all pixels (White(0) or Active) that are Strictly_Enclosed by a specific Blue_Component.
  - Wall_Influencers: Set of colors of Active_Pixels that are Strictly_Enclosed or Adjacent to a specific Blue_Component.
  - Fill_Influencers: Set of colors of Active_Pixels that are Strictly_Enclosed by a specific Blue_Component. If empty, use colors of Adjacent Active_Pixels instead.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Grid structure, adjacency (4-neighbor), distance (Manhattan).
  - Containment: Blue_Components enclose Enclosed_Regions.
  - Association: Active_Pixels are associated with Blue_Components based on enclosure or adjacency.
  - Influence:
      - External Active_Pixels act as seeds for Voronoi fill of non-enclosed White(0) pixels.
      - Wall_Influencers determine the transformation of Blue(1) pixels.
      - Fill_Influencers determine the fill color for enclosed White(0) pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Components: Find connected Blue_Components.
  - Determine_Reachability: Identify all pixels reachable from the border without crossing Blue(1).
  - Categorize_Active_Pixels: Assign roles (Strictly_Enclosed, Adjacent, External) to each Active_Pixel. Associate influencers with Blue_Components.
  - Calculate_Voronoi_Fill: Fill reachable White(0) pixels based on nearest External Active_Pixel (Manhattan distance, tie-break row then column).
  - Determine_Wall_Transformation: For each Blue_Component, apply the rule: Red(2) if Red(2) is the only non-Azure(8) color in Wall_Influencers, else Azure(8).
  - Determine_Enclosed_Fill: For each Blue_Component, find the Fill_Influencers. Apply color priority Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8). Default to Azure(8) if none present.
  - Apply_Transformations: Combine Voronoi fill, Wall Transformation, and Enclosed Fill into the final output grid. Active_Pixels retain their original color unless overwritten by a wall transformation (which shouldn't happen if partitioning is correct).

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored.
  - Transformed_Walls: Original Blue(1) pixels changed based on Wall_Influencers.
  - Filled_Enclosed_Area: Original White(0) pixels in Enclosed_Regions filled based on Fill_Influencers.
  - Filled_Outside_Area: Original White(0) pixels not in Enclosed_Regions filled by Voronoi based on External Active_Pixels.
  - Preserved_Active_Pixels: Active_Pixels retain their original color.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialization:** Create the `output_grid` as a copy of the `input_grid`. Identify all 'active pixels' (non-white, non-blue).
2.  **Identify Regions and Roles:**
    a.  Determine the set of all pixels `reachable_mask` from the border without crossing blue(1) pixels (e.g., using BFS from non-blue border cells).
    b.  Categorize each 'active pixel':
        i.  If it's not in `reachable_mask`, it's 'Strictly_Enclosed'.
        ii. If it *is* in `reachable_mask` but has a blue(1) 4-neighbor, it's 'Adjacent'.
        iii. Otherwise (in `reachable_mask` and no blue neighbors), it's 'External'.
    c. Identify connected components of blue(1) pixels ('walls'). For each wall component, determine its associated 'Strictly_Enclosed', 'Adjacent', and 'External' active pixels (e.g., based on proximity or shared enclosed space - requires careful implementation if multiple disjoint walls exist, but assume one main wall structure per example for now).
3.  **Determine Transformation Colors:**
    a.  **Wall Color:** Find the set `Wall_Influencers` (colors of 'Strictly_Enclosed' + 'Adjacent' active pixels). The wall color becomes Red(2) if Red(2) is in the set and no colors other than Red(2) and Azure(8) are present. Otherwise, the wall color is Azure(8).
    b.  **Fill Color:** Find the set `Fill_Influencers_Strict` (colors of 'Strictly_Enclosed' active pixels). If this set is empty, use the set `Fill_Influencers_Adj` (colors of 'Adjacent' active pixels). Check for priority colors in the chosen set: if Green(3) is present, fill color is Green(3); else if Magenta(6) is present, fill color is Magenta(6); else if Azure(8) is present, fill color is Azure(8); otherwise, default fill color is Azure(8).
4.  **Apply Voronoi Fill for External Area:**
    a.  Identify all 'External' active pixels; these are the `seeds`.
    b.  For each pixel (r, c) where `input_grid[r, c]` is white(0) and `reachable_mask[r, c]` is true:
        i.  Calculate Manhattan distance to all `seeds`.
        ii. Find the minimum distance and the corresponding `seeds`.
        iii. Tie-break using the seed with the lowest row index, then the lowest column index.
        iv. Set `output_grid[r, c]` to the color of the selected winning seed.
5.  **Apply Wall and Enclosed Area Transformations:**
    a.  For every pixel (r, c) where `input_grid[r, c]` was blue(1), set `output_grid[r, c]` to the calculated `Wall Color`.
    b.  For every pixel (r, c) where `input_grid[r, c]` was white(0) and `reachable_mask[r, c]` is false (i.e., enclosed white pixel), set `output_grid[r, c]` to the calculated `Fill Color`.
6.  **Finalize:** Active pixels should have retained their original colors from the initial copy unless overwritten by the wall transformation (Step 5a - this indicates an error in partitioning if an active pixel was classified as blue). Return the `output_grid`.
