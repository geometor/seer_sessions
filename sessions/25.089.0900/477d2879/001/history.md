Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of colored pixels (0-9). The size remains the same between input and output (13x13 in all examples).
2.  **Background:** The input grids have a white (0) background. The output grids are completely filled with non-white colors.
3.  **Key Input Components:**
    *   **Blue Shapes (Color 1):** There are distinct shapes made of blue pixels. These shapes act like containers or walls.
    *   **Internal Pixels:** Inside the blue shapes, there can be white pixels (0) or other colored pixels (e.g., red, azure, magenta, green).
    *   **External "Seed" Pixels:** There are isolated non-white pixels located outside the blue shapes, on the white background.
4.  **Transformation - Background:** The white background pixels in the input are filled in the output. The fill color for any given background pixel seems to be determined by the color of the nearest "seed" pixel (using Manhattan distance). This resembles a Voronoi tessellation based on the seed pixels. Tie-breaking likely uses row/column order.
5.  **Transformation - Blue Shapes:**
    *   The blue (1) pixels themselves change color. This new color seems dependent on the colors of the *internal* pixels enclosed by the blue shape. If an internal red (2) pixel exists, the blue pixels become red (2) (Example 1). Otherwise, they become azure (8) (Examples 2 and 3).
    *   The white (0) pixels *enclosed* by the blue shapes are also filled. The fill color depends on the internal non-blue pixels present: Green (3) takes precedence, then Magenta (6), then Azure (8). (Ex3: internal 3,6,8 -> fill 3; Ex2: internal 6,8 -> fill 6; Ex1: internal 2,8 -> fill 8).
    *   The non-white, non-blue pixels *enclosed* by the blue shapes retain their original color in the output.
6.  **Object Interaction:** The blue shapes act as barriers defining distinct "inside" and "outside" regions. The external seeds influence the outside fill, while the internal pixels influence the transformation of the container (blue shape) itself and the fill color of the enclosed white space.

## YAML Facts Documentation


```yaml
Task: Fill grid based on region type (outside vs inside blue shapes)

Input_Features:
  - Grid: 2D array of pixels (colors 0-9).
  - Background_Color: White (0).
  - Container_Color: Blue (1).
  - Objects:
      - Containers: Connected components of Blue(1) pixels.
      - Seeds: Non-white pixels (not Blue(1)) located on the Background(0) and not enclosed by Containers.
      - Enclosed_Pixels: Pixels (White(0) or other colors) spatially enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_White: White(0) pixels enclosed by Containers.
          - Enclosed_Internal: Non-white, non-blue pixels enclosed by Containers.

Relationships:
  - Spatial: Pixels are arranged in a grid. Adjacency and distance (Manhattan) are important.
  - Containment: Blue(1) shapes enclose other pixels.
  - Proximity: Background(0) pixels are associated with the nearest Seed pixel.
  - Influence:
      - Seed colors determine the fill color for Background(0) pixels.
      - Enclosed_Internal colors determine the transformation of Container pixels and the fill color for Enclosed_White pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify_Regions: Differentiate between Background, Containers, Seeds, and Enclosed pixels.
  - Determine_Reachability: Identify which pixels can reach the grid border without crossing Blue(1) pixels (these are Background or Seeds). Pixels that cannot reach are Enclosed.
  - Calculate_Distances: Compute Manhattan distance from Background pixels to Seed pixels.
  - Apply_Voronoi_Fill: Fill reachable Background(0) pixels with the color of the nearest Seed (tie-break by row, then column).
  - Transform_Containers:
      - Change color of Container(Blue=1) pixels based on presence of Red(2) among Enclosed_Internal pixels (if Red(2) present -> Red(2), else -> Azure(8)).
      - Fill Enclosed_White pixels based on priority of Enclosed_Internal colors (Green(3) > Magenta(6) > Azure(8)).
  - Preserve_Colors: Seed pixels and Enclosed_Internal pixels keep their original colors.

Output_Features:
  - Grid: Same dimensions as input, fully colored.
  - No_Background: White(0) pixels are eliminated (either filled by Voronoi or Container transformation).
  - Transformed_Regions: Original regions are replaced by new colors based on the rules.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the basis for the output grid.
2.  **Identify Regions:**
    a.  Find all connected components of blue (1) pixels. These are the "containers".
    b.  Determine which non-blue pixels can reach the grid border by only traversing non-blue pixels (using a flood fill or BFS starting from all border non-blue cells). Mark these as "reachable".
    c.  Identify "seed" pixels: These are the non-white, non-blue pixels marked as "reachable".
    d.  Identify "enclosed" pixels: These are all non-blue pixels *not* marked as "reachable".
3.  **Fill Background:**
    a.  For each pixel (r, c) that is white (0) in the input and marked as "reachable":
        i.  Calculate the Manhattan distance to all identified "seed" pixels.
        ii. Find the minimum distance.
        iii. Identify all seeds at that minimum distance.
        iv. Select the seed with the lowest row index. If there's still a tie, select the one with the lowest column index.
        v.  Set the color of the pixel (r, c) in the output grid to the color of the selected nearest seed.
4.  **Transform Containers:**
    a.  For each identified blue container:
        i.  Find all "enclosed" pixels that are adjacent to this container or spatially inside it.
        ii. Collect the set of colors of the enclosed pixels that are *not* white (0) and *not* blue (1). Call this set `internal_colors`.
        iii. Determine the `fill_color` for enclosed white pixels: If Green(3) is in `internal_colors`, use Green(3). Else if Magenta(6) is in `internal_colors`, use Magenta(6). Else if Azure(8) is in `internal_colors`, use Azure(8). (Assume one of these will be present based on examples).
        iv. Determine the `wall_color` for the container's blue pixels: If Red(2) is in `internal_colors`, use Red(2). Otherwise, use Azure(8).
        v.  Update the output grid:
            1.  For every pixel (r, c) that was part of this container (blue=1 in input), set its color to `wall_color`.
            2.  For every pixel (r, c) that was white (0) in the input and is identified as enclosed within this container, set its color to `fill_color`.
5.  **Finalize:** The output grid now contains the transformed colors. Seed pixels and original enclosed internal pixels have retained their colors from the initial copy.
