            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the presence of an H-like structure and external lines, along with the core actions (clearing internal lines, modifying the crossbar, moving external lines). However, the implementation failed to correctly identify the key components (colors C1/C2, crossbar row, post columns, internal/external lines) and apply the transformations accurately.\n\nThe transformed outputs were nearly identical to the inputs, with only minor, likely erroneous, single-pixel changes near the external lines. This indicates fundamental issues in the `find_colors` and `find_structure_properties` helper functions, preventing the main transformation logic from executing correctly.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  **Refine Color Identification (C1/C2):** The distinction between C1 and C2 is crucial. C1 consistently forms the vertical 'posts' of the H-structure. C2 forms the central vertical segment *between* the posts and also the external vertical lines/extensions. A more robust identification method is needed, potentially focusing on the spatial arrangement rather than just column content. Connectivity analysis might be key.\n2.  **Improve Structure Component Identification:**\n    *   **Crossbar:** Identify the row that connects the C1 posts and contains the internal C2 segment.\n    *   **Posts:** Reliably find the columns of the C1 vertical segments.\n    *   **Internal vs. External C2:** Use connectivity (perhaps starting from C1) to define the main structure. C2 pixels connected to this structure are 'internal', while disconnected C2 pixels are 'external'.\n    *   **Target Column:** Re-evaluate where the external lines move. The initial assumption (`right_edge_col`) seems incorrect based on the expected outputs. It appears they move to align with the `right_post_col`.\n3.  **Correct Transformation Application:** Ensure the pixel modifications use the correctly identified coordinates and colors.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the structures more closely using code execution.\n\n"
