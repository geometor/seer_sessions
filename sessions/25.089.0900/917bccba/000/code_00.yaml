task_context:
  grid_size: [12, 12]
  background_color: 0 # white
  num_distinct_colors_per_example: 3 # background + 2 foreground colors

objects:
  - id: H_structure
    description: A central H-like shape composed of two colors, C1 and C2.
    properties:
      color_1: C1 # Forms vertical posts and part of the crossbar
      color_2: C2 # Forms internal vertical line and part of the crossbar
      bounding_box: Defines the spatial extent.
      crossbar_row: The row index containing the horizontal bar.
      left_post_col: Column index of the leftmost C1 segment defining the H structure on the crossbar row.
      right_post_col: Column index of the rightmost C1 segment defining the H structure on the crossbar row.
      right_edge_col: Column index of the rightmost extent of the H structure's bounding box.

  - id: external_lines
    description: Vertical lines outside the H_structure, composed solely of C2.
    properties:
      color: C2
      column_index: The original column where these lines appear.
      vertical_extent: The rows these lines occupy.

relationships:
  - C2 is present both inside the H_structure (vertical line, crossbar) and as external_lines.
  - external_lines are vertically aligned with the internal C2 vertical line segment.

actions:
  - action: clear_internal_vertical_C2
    object: H_structure
    details: Change pixels of color C2 within the H_structure's bounding box to background_color (0), *except* for those on the crossbar_row.
  - action: modify_crossbar
    object: H_structure
    details: >
      Iterate through the crossbar_row. For columns between left_post_col and right_post_col (inclusive),
      change the pixel color to C1. Pixels outside this column range retain their original color.
  - action: move_external_lines
    object: external_lines
    details: >
      Change the original external_lines pixels to background_color (0).
      Draw new vertical lines of color C2 at the column index defined by H_structure.right_edge_col,
      maintaining the original vertical_extent.
