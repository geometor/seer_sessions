            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code failed because the rule for determining the size parameter (`N`) of the output shape was incorrectly generalized. The initial analysis assumed `N` was always the total count of dynamic pixels (or perhaps the count of the actor color pixels). The execution results show a more nuanced rule:\n\n1.  **Static Color Identification:** The method of identifying the static color (most frequent pixel color, tie-breaking with highest index) appears correct across all examples.\n2.  **Dynamic Pixel Identification:** Correctly identified as all non-white, non-static pixels.\n3.  **Actor Color Identification:** The method of identifying the actor color (most frequent *dynamic* color, tie-breaking with highest index) appears correct across all examples.\n4.  **Shape Parameter `N`:** This was the point of failure. The size parameter depends on the *actor color*.\n    *   For Red (2) and Orange (7), the size parameter is the *total count of all dynamic pixels*.\n    *   For Magenta (6), the size parameter is the *count of the actor (Magenta) pixels only*.\n    *   For Yellow (4), the shape is not a standard triangle or square based on a single size parameter `N`. It's a specific shape: a vertical line whose length is determined by the *count of the actor (Yellow) pixels*.\n5.  **Shape Type/Location:** The mapping of actor color to shape type (triangle/line) and corner location (BL, BR, TL) seems correct based on the examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the logic to calculate two values after identifying dynamic pixels:\n    *   `N_total`: The total count of all dynamic pixels.\n    *   `N_actor`: The count of pixels matching the actor color `A`.\n2.  Update the shape-drawing step to use the correct size parameter (`N_total` or `N_actor`) based on the actor color `A`, as determined above.\n3.  Implement the specific drawing logic for the Yellow (4) case (vertical line).\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\n| Example | Grid Size (HxW) | Static Color (Count) | Dynamic Pixels (Colors/Counts)                     | N_total | Actor Color (A) | N_actor | Shape Rule Used       | Expected Shape         | Code Matches Expected? |\n| :------ | :-------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :-------------- | :------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |\n| 1       | 6x9             | Red(2) (5)           | Yellow(4): 2, Green(3): 1                          | 3       | Yellow(4)       | 2       | A=4 -> VertLine(N_actor) | Vert Line, Len 2, BR | Yes                    |\n| 2       | 11x11           | Orange(7) (8)        | Red(2): 2, Blue(1): 1, Green(3): 1, Azure(8): 1 | 5       | Red(2)          | 2       | A=2 -> Tri(N_total)     | Triangle, Size 5, BL | Yes                    |\n| 3       | 15x14           | Azure(8) (12)        | Magenta(6): 4, Green(3): 1                         | 5       | Magenta(6)      | 4       | A=6 -> Tri(N_actor)     | Triangle, Size 4, BR | Yes                    |\n| 4       | 10x10           | Azure(8) (6)         | Orange(7): 2, Maroon(9): 1, Yellow(4): 1, Green(3): 1 | 5       | Orange(7)       | 2       | A=7 -> Tri(N_total)     | Triangle, Size 5, TL | Yes                    |\n\n*(Note: \"Code Matches Expected?\" assumes the revised logic outlined above is implemented. The previous code failed on examples 1, 3, and potentially 2 due to incorrect reporting in the prompt, and 4 due to misidentification of the static color rule)*\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"
