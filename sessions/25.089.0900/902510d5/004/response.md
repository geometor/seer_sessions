## General Assessment

The previous code failed because the rule for determining the size parameter (`N`) of the output shape was incorrectly generalized. The initial analysis assumed `N` was always the total count of dynamic pixels (or perhaps the count of the actor color pixels). The execution results show a more nuanced rule:

1.  **Static Color Identification:** The method of identifying the static color (most frequent pixel color, tie-breaking with highest index) appears correct across all examples.
2.  **Dynamic Pixel Identification:** Correctly identified as all non-white, non-static pixels.
3.  **Actor Color Identification:** The method of identifying the actor color (most frequent *dynamic* color, tie-breaking with highest index) appears correct across all examples.
4.  **Shape Parameter `N`:** This was the point of failure. The size parameter depends on the *actor color*.
    *   For Red (2) and Orange (7), the size parameter is the *total count of all dynamic pixels*.
    *   For Magenta (6), the size parameter is the *count of the actor (Magenta) pixels only*.
    *   For Yellow (4), the shape is not a standard triangle or square based on a single size parameter `N`. It's a specific shape: a vertical line whose length is determined by the *count of the actor (Yellow) pixels*.
5.  **Shape Type/Location:** The mapping of actor color to shape type (triangle/line) and corner location (BL, BR, TL) seems correct based on the examples.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the logic to calculate two values after identifying dynamic pixels:
    *   `N_total`: The total count of all dynamic pixels.
    *   `N_actor`: The count of pixels matching the actor color `A`.
2.  Update the shape-drawing step to use the correct size parameter (`N_total` or `N_actor`) based on the actor color `A`, as determined above.
3.  Implement the specific drawing logic for the Yellow (4) case (vertical line).

## Metrics and Verification

| 3       | 15x14           | Azure(8) (12)        | Magenta(6): 4, Green(3): 1                         | 5       | Magenta(6)      | 4       | A=6 -> Tri(N_actor)     | Triangle, Size 4, BR | Yes                    |
| 4       | 10x10           | Azure(8) (6)         | Orange(7): 2, Maroon(9): 1, Yellow(4): 1, Green(3): 1 | 5       | Orange(7)       | 2       | A=7 -> Tri(N_total)     | Triangle, Size 5, TL | Yes                    |

*(Note: "Code Matches Expected?" assumes the revised logic outlined above is implemented. The previous code failed on examples 1, 3, and potentially 2 due to incorrect reporting in the prompt, and 4 due to misidentification of the static color rule)*

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a white grid with the same dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) as the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and count the occurrences of each color.
3.  Determine the "static color" `S`: Find the color with the highest total pixel count. If there is a tie in count, select the color with the highest numerical index as `S`.
4.  Identify "static pixels": These are all pixels in the input grid with color `S`. Copy these static pixels (preserving their color `S` and coordinates) to the output grid.
5.  Identify "dynamic pixels": These are all non-white pixels in the input grid that do *not* have the static color `S`.
6.  Calculate `N_total`: Count the total number of dynamic pixels.
7.  Determine the "actor color" `A`: Find the color that appears most frequently among the dynamic pixels. If there's a tie for the highest frequency, select the color with the highest numerical index as `A`.
8.  Calculate `N_actor`: Count the number of dynamic pixels that have the actor color `A`.
9.  If an actor color `A` was found (i.e., if there were any dynamic pixels):
    *   **If `A` is Yellow (4):** Draw a vertical line using color `A` in the bottom-right corner. The line should consist of `N_actor` pixels occupying coordinates `(r, W-1)` where `H - N_actor <= r < H`.
    *   **If `A` is Red (2) and `N_total` > 0:** Draw a right-angled triangle using color `A` in the bottom-left corner. The triangle occupies pixels `(r, c)` where `H - N_total <= r < H`, `0 <= c < N_total`, and the condition `(H - 1 - r) + c < N_total` is met.
    *   **If `A` is Magenta (6) and `N_actor` > 0:** Draw a right-angled triangle using color `A` in the bottom-right corner. The triangle occupies pixels `(r, c)` where `H - N_actor <= r < H`, `W - N_actor <= c < W`, and the condition `(H - 1 - r) + (W - 1 - c) < N_actor` is met.
    *   **If `A` is Orange (7) and `N_total` > 0:** Draw a right-angled triangle using color `A` in the top-left corner. The triangle occupies pixels `(r, c)` where `0 <= r < N_total`, `0 <= c < N_total`, and the condition `r + c < N_total` is met.
10. The final grid, containing the static pixels and the drawn shape (if any), is the output.
