All other non-white colors are \"dynamic\".\n    *   The dynamic pixels are removed from their original positions.\n    *   A new shape (either a square or a triangle) is drawn in one corner of the grid.\n    *   The color of the new shape is determined by one of the dynamic colors \u2013 specifically, the dynamic color that appeared most frequently in the input. If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the higher index seems to be chosen. Let's call this the \"actor color\".\n    *   The size of the new shape (side length N for triangles, N x N for squares) is determined by the total count (N) of all dynamic pixels in the input.\n    *   The type of shape (square or triangle), its corner location, and its orientation depend specifically on the *actor color's index*.\n        *   Actor Red (2): Results in a N-side triangle in the Bottom-Left corner, pointing Up-Right.\n        *   Actor Yellow (4): Results in a 2x2 square in the Bottom-Right corner (specifically when N=2).\n        *   Actor Magenta (6): Results in a N-side triangle in the Bottom-Right corner, pointing Up-Left.\n        *   Actor Orange (7): Results in a N-side triangle in the Top-Left corner, pointing Down-Right.\n    *   The final output combines the preserved static pixels and the newly drawn shape on a white background.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

If two or more dynamic colors share the highest frequency, choose the one with the largest color index as `A`.\n    6.

Place the identified static pixels (color `S`) onto the output grid at their original locations.\n    8.
