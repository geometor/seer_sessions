**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code failed on three out of four training examples. The primary issues stem from incorrect identification of the "static" color and consequently, incorrect identification of "dynamic" pixels. This led to errors in calculating the shape size parameter `N` and determining the "actor" color, ultimately resulting in the wrong shape, color, size, and location being drawn in the output grid.

The strategy is to:
1.  **Correct Static Color Identification:** Revert to the method of comparing input and output grids directly to find pixels of the same non-white color in the same location. This color is the static color.
2.  **Recalculate Dynamic Pixels:** All non-white pixels in the input that are *not* the static color are dynamic.
3.  **Re-evaluate Actor Color Rule:** Determine the most frequent color among the *correctly identified* dynamic pixels, using the highest color index as a tie-breaker.
4.  **Re-evaluate Shape Size `N`:** Calculate `N` as the *total count* of all correctly identified dynamic pixels.
5.  **Refine Shape Drawing Rules:** Confirm the mapping between the actor color and the resulting shape's type, corner, orientation, and size (using the recalculated `N`), paying special attention to the case where the actor color is Yellow (4).

**Analysis of Metrics and Correction**

The metrics reveal issues with the `get_metrics` function itself, specifically in identifying the static color and output shape correctly based on the provided *expected* output, leading to incorrect downstream calculations in examples 2 and 4.

Let's re-evaluate manually based on visual inspection and the core hypothesis:
*   **Example 1:** Input vs Output. Red(2) pixels are unchanged. Static=Red(2), Count=5. Dynamic={Yellow(4)x2, Green(3)x1}. N=3. Actor=Yellow(4). Output shape is Yellow(4) 2x2 square (pixels=4, *not 3 as code calculated*). Metrics code was wrong about output shape pixel count.
*   **Example 2:** Input vs Output. Orange(7) pixels are unchanged. Static=Orange(7), Count=8. Dynamic={Blue(1)x1, Red(2)x2, Green(3)x1, Azure(8)x1}. N=5. Actor=Red(2). Output shape is Red(2) Triangle Side 5 (pixels=15). Metrics code failed to find static color.
*   **Example 3:** Input vs Output. Azure(8) pixels are unchanged. Static=Azure(8), Count=15. Dynamic={Magenta(6)x4, Green(3)x1}. N=5. Actor=Magenta(6). Output shape is Magenta(6) Triangle Side 5 (pixels=15, *not 10 as code calculated*). Metrics code was wrong about output shape pixel count.
*   **Example 4:** Input vs Output. Azure(8) pixels are unchanged. Static=Azure(8), Count=6. Dynamic={Maroon(9)x1, Orange(7)x2, Yellow(4)x1, Green(3)x1}. N=5. Actor=Orange(7). Output shape is Orange(7) Triangle Side 5 (pixels=15). Metrics code failed to find static color.

**Corrected Understanding:**
*   Static color identification: Find the non-white color `S` whose pixel coordinates are identical between input and output.
*   Dynamic pixels: All non-white pixels in the input that are *not* color `S`.
*   Size parameter `N`: Total count of all dynamic pixels.
*   Actor color `A`: The dynamic color with the highest frequency. Tie-break using the highest color index.
*   Output shape:
    *   If Actor Color `A` is Yellow (4), draw a 2x2 square of color `A` in the Bottom-Right corner.
    *   Otherwise, draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A`. The corner and orientation depend on `A`:
        *   `A` = Red (2): Bottom-Left corner, hypotenuse Up-Right.
        *   `A` = Magenta (6): Bottom-Right corner, hypotenuse Up-Left.
        *   `A` = Orange (7): Top-Left corner, hypotenuse Down-Right.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Static Pixels:** Compare the input grid and the expected output grid. Find the single non-white color (`S`) whose pixels appear in the exact same coordinates in both grids. Store the coordinates of these static pixels.
2.  **Identify Dynamic Pixels:** Scan the input grid. Any non-white pixel that does *not* have the static color `S` is a dynamic pixel. Collect all dynamic pixels, noting their colors and original locations.
3.  **Calculate Size Parameter `N`:** Count the total number of dynamic pixels identified in step 2. This count is `N`.
4.  **Determine Actor Color `A`:** Count the frequency of each color among the dynamic pixels. The color with the highest frequency is the actor color `A`. If there is a tie for the highest frequency, choose the color with the highest numerical index as `A`.
5.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).
6.  **Place Static Pixels:** Copy the static pixels (with color `S`) identified in step 1 onto the output grid at their original coordinates.
7.  **Determine Output Shape Properties:**
    *   The color of the output shape is the actor color `A`.
    *   If `A` is Yellow (4): The shape is a 2x2 square, located in the bottom-right corner.
    *   If `A` is Red (2): The shape is a right-angled triangle with side length `N`, located in the bottom-left corner, with the hypotenuse pointing towards the top-right.
    *   If `A` is Magenta (6): The shape is a right-angled triangle with side length `N`, located in the bottom-right corner, with the hypotenuse pointing towards the top-left.
    *   If `A` is Orange (7): The shape is a right-angled triangle with side length `N`, located in the top-left corner, with the hypotenuse pointing towards the bottom-right.
8.  **Draw Output Shape:** Draw the determined shape (square or triangle) onto the output grid using its specific color (`A`), size (`2x2` or `N`), corner location, and orientation. Ensure drawing respects grid boundaries. (It is assumed the shape area does not overlap with static pixels based on examples).
