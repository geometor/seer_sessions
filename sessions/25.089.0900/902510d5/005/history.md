*   **Perception:**
    *   Each input grid contains multiple non-white colors, often scattered.
    *   Each output grid retains some pixels from the input grid in their original locations, while other pixels are removed, and a new geometric shape is added in one of the corners.
    *   There appears to be one "static" color in each pair, whose pixels remain unchanged. All other non-white colors are "dynamic".
    *   The dynamic pixels are removed from their original positions.
    *   A new shape (either a square or a triangle) is drawn in one corner of the grid.
    *   The color of the new shape is determined by one of the dynamic colors â€“ specifically, the dynamic color that appeared most frequently in the input. If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the higher index seems to be chosen. Let's call this the "actor color".
    *   The size of the new shape (side length N for triangles, N x N for squares) is determined by the total count (N) of all dynamic pixels in the input.
    *   The type of shape (square or triangle), its corner location, and its orientation depend specifically on the *actor color's index*.
        *   Actor Red (2): Results in a N-side triangle in the Bottom-Left corner, pointing Up-Right.
        *   Actor Yellow (4): Results in a 2x2 square in the Bottom-Right corner (specifically when N=2).
        *   Actor Magenta (6): Results in a N-side triangle in the Bottom-Right corner, pointing Up-Left.
        *   Actor Orange (7): Results in a N-side triangle in the Top-Left corner, pointing Down-Right.
    *   The final output combines the preserved static pixels and the newly drawn shape on a white background.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the "static color" `S` by finding which non-white color's pixels have the exact same coordinates in both the input and output grids. Store the locations of these static pixels.
    2.  Identify all "dynamic pixels" in the input grid: these are all non-white pixels that do not have the static color `S`.
    3.  Count the total number `N` of dynamic pixels.
    4.  Determine the frequency (count) of each color present among the dynamic pixels.
    5.  Identify the "actor color" `A` as the dynamic color with the highest frequency. If two or more dynamic colors share the highest frequency, choose the one with the largest color index as `A`.
    6.  Initialize the output grid as a white grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    7.  Place the identified static pixels (color `S`) onto the output grid at their original locations.
    8.  Determine the corner, shape type, orientation, and size based on the actor color `A` and the count `N`:
        *   If `A` is Red (2): Draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A`, located in the Bottom-Left corner, with the hypotenuse facing Up-Right.
        *   If `A` is Yellow (4) and `N` is 2: Draw a 2x2 square using color `A`, located in the Bottom-Right corner.
        *   If `A` is Magenta (6): Draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A`, located in the Bottom-Right corner, with the hypotenuse facing Up-Left.
        *   If `A` is Orange (7): Draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A`, located in the Top-Left corner, with the hypotenuse facing Down-Right.
        *   (Define behavior for other potential actor colors or the case where A=Yellow(4) but N is not 2, if necessary based on test cases).
    9.  Draw the determined shape onto the output grid. Existing static pixels should not be overwritten (though based on examples, the shape area seems distinct from static pixel locations).

"""
Transformation Rule Description:

1.  **Identify Static vs. Dynamic Pixels:**
    *   Find all contiguous objects (blocks of the same non-white color).
    *   Determine the largest object (by pixel count). The color of this largest object is the "static color". All pixels of this color remain unchanged in the output.
    *   All other non-white pixels are "dynamic pixels". These are removed from their original positions.

2.  **Determine Actor Color and Shape Size:**
    *   Count the frequency of each color among the dynamic pixels.
    *   The "actor color" is the dynamic color with the highest frequency. If there's a tie in frequency, the color with the highest numerical index wins.
    *   The size parameter `N` for the output shape is the count of pixels of the actor color.

3.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
    *   Copy the static pixels (with the static color) to the output grid at their original locations.
    *   Based on the actor color and size `N`, draw a specific shape in a specific corner using the actor color:
        *   **Red (2):** Bottom-Left corner, Right-angled triangle of side `N`, hypotenuse pointing Up-Right. Pixels `(r, c)` where `H-N <= r < H`, `0 <= c < N`, and `(H - 1 - r) + c < N`.
        *   **Yellow (4):** If `N` is 2, Bottom-Right corner, 2x2 square. Pixels `(r, c)` where `H-2 <= r < H` and `W-2 <= c < W`. (Behavior for N!=2 is unspecified by examples, assumed not to occur or not to draw shape).
        *   **Magenta (6):** Bottom-Right corner, Right-angled triangle of side `N`, hypotenuse pointing Up-Left. Pixels `(r, c)` where `H-N <= r < H`, `W-N <= c < W`, and `(H - 1 - r) + (W - 1 - c) < N`.
        *   **Orange (7):** Top-Left corner, Right-angled triangle of side `N`, hypotenuse pointing Down-Right. Pixels `(r, c)` where `0 <= r < N`, `0 <= c < N`, and `r + c < N`.
    *   The final output grid contains the static pixels and the newly drawn shape.

Transformation Rule Description:

1.  **Identify Static Color:** Determine the non-white color (`S`) that has the highest total pixel count in the input grid. If there's a tie in count, choose the color with the highest numerical index.
2.  **Identify Static and Dynamic Pixels:**
    *   All pixels in the input grid with the static color `S` are "static pixels".
    *   All other non-white pixels in the input grid are "dynamic pixels".
3.  **Calculate Shape Size Parameter `N`:** Count the total number of dynamic pixels. This count is `N`.
4.  **Determine Actor Color `A`:** Find the color that appears most frequently among the dynamic pixels. If there's a tie for the highest frequency, choose the color with the highest numerical index as the "actor color" `A`.
5.  **Construct Output Grid:**
    *   Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with white (0).
    *   Copy all static pixels (color `S`) from the input grid to the output grid at their original coordinates.
    *   Determine the shape to draw based on the actor color `A`:
        *   If `A` is Yellow (4): Draw a 2x2 square using color `A` in the Bottom-Right corner.
        *   If `A` is Red (2): Draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A` in the Bottom-Left corner, with the hypotenuse pointing Up-Right.
        *   If `A` is Magenta (6): Draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A` in the Bottom-Right corner, with the hypotenuse pointing Up-Left.
        *   If `A` is Orange (7): Draw a right-angled triangle of side length `N` using color `A` in the Top-Left corner, with the hypotenuse pointing Down-Right.

## General Assessment

The previous code failed because the rule for determining the size parameter (`N`) of the output shape was incorrectly generalized. The initial analysis assumed `N` was always the total count of dynamic pixels (or perhaps the count of the actor color pixels). The execution results show a more nuanced rule:

1.  **Static Color Identification:** The method of identifying the static color (most frequent pixel color, tie-breaking with highest index) appears correct across all examples.
2.  **Dynamic Pixel Identification:** Correctly identified as all non-white, non-static pixels.
3.  **Actor Color Identification:** The method of identifying the actor color (most frequent *dynamic* color, tie-breaking with highest index) appears correct across all examples.
4.  **Shape Parameter `N`:** This was the point of failure. The size parameter depends on the *actor color*.
    *   For Red (2) and Orange (7), the size parameter is the *total count of all dynamic pixels*.
    *   For Magenta (6), the size parameter is the *count of the actor (Magenta) pixels only*.
    *   For Yellow (4), the shape is not a standard triangle or square based on a single size parameter `N`. It's a specific shape: a vertical line whose length is determined by the *count of the actor (Yellow) pixels*.
5.  **Shape Type/Location:** The mapping of actor color to shape type (triangle/line) and corner location (BL, BR, TL) seems correct based on the examples.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the logic to calculate two values after identifying dynamic pixels:
    *   `N_total`: The total count of all dynamic pixels.
    *   `N_actor`: The count of pixels matching the actor color `A`.
2.  Update the shape-drawing step to use the correct size parameter (`N_total` or `N_actor`) based on the actor color `A`, as determined above.
3.  Implement the specific drawing logic for the Yellow (4) case (vertical line).

## Metrics and Verification

| Example | Grid Size (HxW) | Static Color (Count) | Dynamic Pixels (Colors/Counts)                     | N_total | Actor Color (A) | N_actor | Shape Rule Used       | Expected Shape         | Code Matches Expected? |
| :------ | :-------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :-------------- | :------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |

| 2       | 11x11           | Orange(7) (8)        | Red(2): 2, Blue(1): 1, Green(3): 1, Azure(8): 1 | 5       | Red(2)          | 2       | A=2 -> Tri(N_total)     | Triangle, Size 5, BL | Yes                    |
| 3       | 15x14           | Azure(8) (12)        | Magenta(6): 4, Green(3): 1                         | 5       | Magenta(6)      | 4       | A=6 -> Tri(N_actor)     | Triangle, Size 4, BR | Yes                    |
| 4       | 10x10           | Azure(8) (6)         | Orange(7): 2, Maroon(9): 1, Yellow(4): 1, Green(3): 1 | 5       | Orange(7)       | 2       | A=7 -> Tri(N_total)     | Triangle, Size 5, TL | Yes                    |

*(Note: "Code Matches Expected?" assumes the revised logic outlined above is implemented. The previous code failed on examples 1, 3, and potentially 2 due to incorrect reporting in the prompt, and 4 due to misidentification of the static color rule)*

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a white grid with the same dimensions (height `H`, width `W`) as the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid and count the occurrences of each color.
3.  Determine the "static color" `S`: Find the color with the highest total pixel count. If there is a tie in count, select the color with the highest numerical index as `S`.
4.  Identify "static pixels": These are all pixels in the input grid with color `S`. Copy these static pixels (preserving their color `S` and coordinates) to the output grid.
5.  Identify "dynamic pixels": These are all non-white pixels in the input grid that do *not* have the static color `S`.
6.  Calculate `N_total`: Count the total number of dynamic pixels.
7.  Determine the "actor color" `A`: Find the color that appears most frequently among the dynamic pixels. If there's a tie for the highest frequency, select the color with the highest numerical index as `A`.
8.  Calculate `N_actor`: Count the number of dynamic pixels that have the actor color `A`.
9.  If an actor color `A` was found (i.e., if there were any dynamic pixels):
    *   **If `A` is Yellow (4):** Draw a vertical line using color `A` in the bottom-right corner. The line should consist of `N_actor` pixels occupying coordinates `(r, W-1)` where `H - N_actor <= r < H`.
    *   **If `A` is Red (2) and `N_total` > 0:** Draw a right-angled triangle using color `A` in the bottom-left corner. The triangle occupies pixels `(r, c)` where `H - N_total <= r < H`, `0 <= c < N_total`, and the condition `(H - 1 - r) + c < N_total` is met.
    *   **If `A` is Magenta (6) and `N_actor` > 0:** Draw a right-angled triangle using color `A` in the bottom-right corner. The triangle occupies pixels `(r, c)` where `H - N_actor <= r < H`, `W - N_actor <= c < W`, and the condition `(H - 1 - r) + (W - 1 - c) < N_actor` is met.
    *   **If `A` is Orange (7) and `N_total` > 0:** Draw a right-angled triangle using color `A` in the top-left corner. The triangle occupies pixels `(r, c)` where `0 <= r < N_total`, `0 <= c < N_total`, and the condition `r + c < N_total` is met.
10. The final grid, containing the static pixels and the drawn shape (if any), is the output.
