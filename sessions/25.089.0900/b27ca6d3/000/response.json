            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output grids consist primarily of white pixels (0) with some scattered red pixels (2). The output grids additionally contain green pixels (3).\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve changing some white (0) pixels to green (3) based on the positions of the red (2) pixels. The original red pixels remain unchanged in the output.\n3.  **Pattern:** The green pixels in the output appear in the vicinity of *some* of the red pixels from the input. Specifically, they form a sort of \"aura\" or \"boundary\" around groups of red pixels.\n4.  **Object Identification:** The red pixels can be considered as individual objects or grouped into larger objects (components) if they are connected. Connection seems to include horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency.\n5.  **Condition for Change:** Comparing the two examples, it appears that green pixels are only added around red components that consist of *more than one* connected red pixel. Isolated single red pixels do not cause any changes in their neighborhood.\n6.  **Neighborhood Definition:** The green pixels appear in the 8 cells immediately surrounding (including diagonals) the red pixels belonging to the multi-pixel components. If a neighboring cell is already red, it remains red. If it's white, it becomes green.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
