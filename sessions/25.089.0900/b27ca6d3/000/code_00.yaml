Transformation: Grid Color Modification

Input Grid:
  - Contains pixels of colors: white (0), red (2).

Output Grid:
  - Contains pixels of colors: white (0), red (2), green (3).
  - Red (2) pixel locations are preserved from the input.
  - Some white (0) pixels from the input are changed to green (3).

Objects:
  - Red Pixels (value 2): Primary elements driving the transformation.
  - Red Components: Groups of one or more red pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (8-connectivity).
  - Connectivity: Red pixels form components based on adjacency.

Actions:
  - Identify connected components of red pixels in the input grid.
  - Count the number of pixels in each red component.
  - Filter components: Select only those red components containing more than one pixel.
  - Identify Neighborhood: For each selected component, find all grid cells adjacent (8-connectivity) to any pixel within that component.
  - Conditional Coloring:
    - If an adjacent cell in the input grid is white (0), change its color to green (3) in the output grid.
    - If an adjacent cell is already red (2), it remains red (2) in the output grid.
  - Preserve Unchanged Pixels: All original red pixels and white pixels not adjacent to the selected multi-pixel red components remain unchanged in the output grid.
