Transformation Rule:

1. Identify all connected components of red (2) pixels in the input grid, considering horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency (8-connectivity).
2. For each red component found, count the number of pixels it contains.
3. If a red component contains more than one pixel:
    a. Find all white (0) pixels in the input grid that are adjacent (8-connectivity) to *any* of the red pixels belonging to this component.
    b. Change the color of these adjacent white pixels to green (3) in the output grid.
4. All original red (2) pixels remain unchanged.
5. All white (0) pixels that are not adjacent to a multi-pixel red component remain unchanged.
