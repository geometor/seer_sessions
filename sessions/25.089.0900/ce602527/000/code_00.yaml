task_context:
  description: Extract a specific object from the input grid based on its shape representing a numerical digit.
  grid_properties:
    - background_color: The most frequent color in the input grid. Varies between examples.
    - objects: Contiguous areas of non-background colors.

objects:
  - type: digit_object
    description: An object whose shape visually corresponds to a numerical digit (0-9).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - shape: The spatial arrangement of pixels.
      - represented_value: The numerical digit the shape represents (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5).
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle enclosing the object.
  - type: non_digit_object
    description: An object whose shape does not resemble a standard numerical digit.

actions:
  - identify_background: Determine the background color of the input grid.
  - find_objects: Locate all contiguous blocks of non-background colors.
  - recognize_digits: For each object, determine if its shape represents a numerical digit and, if so, which one.
  - select_target_object:
      condition: If one or more digit_objects are found.
      rule: Choose the digit_object with the smallest represented_value.
  - extract_bounding_box: Define the output grid based on the bounding_box of the selected_target_object.
  - populate_output: Copy the pixels (both object color and original background color) from the input grid within the extracted_bounding_box to the output grid.

relationships:
  - selection_based_on_value: The choice of which object to extract depends on comparing the numerical values represented by the shapes of potential digit_objects. The minimum value determines the selection.
  - output_content_source: The colors and arrangement within the output grid are directly copied from the corresponding area (bounding box) in the input grid.
