Other objects might have different shapes.\n3.  **Multiple Digit Objects:** An input grid can contain multiple objects that resemble digits.\n4.  **Background Color Variation:** The background color is not fixed; it changes between examples (red, azure, blue).\n5.  **Output Grid Structure:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It appears to be the bounding box of one specific object selected from the input.\n6.  **Output Content:** The output grid contains the pixels corresponding to the selected object and the background pixels from the *original input grid* that fall within that object's bounding box.\n7.  **Selection Criterion:** The key transformation seems to involve identifying all objects that look like digits, determining the numerical value each represents, and selecting the object corresponding to the *smallest* numerical value.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"

Find all distinct contiguous objects composed of non-background colors.\n3.

Examine the list of objects identified as digits. If no objects represent digits, the transformation might be undefined or result in a default output (though this case isn't shown in the examples).\n5.  If one or more digit-objects were found, select the object that represents the *smallest* numerical value. If there's a tie (multiple objects representing the same smallest value), select any one of them (e.g., the first one found).\n6.  Determine the coordinates of the bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all pixels) of the selected digit-object.\n7.  Create a new output grid whose dimensions match the dimensions of the bounding box.\n8.  Copy the pixels from the input grid located within the calculated bounding box area directly into the corresponding positions in the new output grid. The copied pixels will include both the pixels of the selected object and any background-colored pixels from the input grid that were inside the bounding box."
