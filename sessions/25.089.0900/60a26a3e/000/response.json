The output grids additionally contain blue (1) pixels.\n2.  **Input Objects:** The input grids contain multiple instances of a specific shape made of red (2) pixels. This shape resembles a plus sign '+' or sometimes an 'H' where the central horizontal bar is missing. More accurately, it's a central red pixel with single red pixels directly above, below, left, and right of it. The background is white (0).\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels to the grid. These blue pixels form straight lines, either horizontal or vertical.\n4.  **Relationship:** The blue lines appear *between* pairs of the red '+' shapes present in the input.\n5.  **Conditions for Transformation:**\n    *   A blue line is drawn between the *center* pixels of two red '+' shapes *only if* these center pixels lie on the same row (horizontal alignment) or the same column (vertical alignment).\n    *   The blue line fills the white (0) pixels strictly *between* the two center pixels along that row or column. The center pixels themselves remain red.\n    *   No other pixels are changed.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Iterate through all unique pairs of the identified center pixels.\n4.  For each pair of center pixels (P1 at (r1, c1) and P2 at (r2, c2)):\n    a.  Check if they are horizontally aligned (r1 == r2) and have at least one white (0) pixel between them (abs(c1 - c2) > 1).\n    b.  If horizontally aligned, fill all white (0) pixels in the output grid at row r1 between column c1 and column c2 (exclusive of c1 and c2) with blue (1).\n    c.  Check if they are vertically aligned (c1 == c2) and have at least one white (0) pixel between them (abs(r1 - r2) > 1).\n    d.  If vertically aligned, fill all white (0) pixels in the output grid at column c1 between row r1 and row r2 (exclusive of r1 and r2) with blue (1).\n5.  Return the modified output grid."
