            "text": "*   **Perception**: The task involves identifying two distinct colored pixels in the input grid. These pixels serve as anchors or starting points. The transformation draws two connected \"staple\" or \"U\" shapes based on the positions of these two initial pixels. The orientation (horizontal or vertical) and position of the final structure depend on the relative positions of the input pixels. Each initial pixel determines the color and one half of the final structure. The two halves meet near the midpoint between the initial pixels. The structure consists of a line segment drawn from the initial pixel towards the midpoint, a perpendicular line segment of length 5 centered near the midpoint, and a connection between the centers of these perpendicular segments.\n\n*   **Facts (YAML)**:\n    "
