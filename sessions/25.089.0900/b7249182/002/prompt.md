"""
This transformation identifies two distinct colored pixels in the input grid.
It then draws two connected 'staple' or 'U' shapes centered around the midpoint 
between these two pixels. The orientation of the staples (horizontal or vertical) 
depends on whether the input pixels share the same row or column.

1. Find the coordinates and colors of the two non-white pixels in the input grid.
2. Calculate the midpoint coordinates between these two pixels.
3. Determine the orientation:
   - If the pixels are in the same row (horizontal orientation):
     - Calculate the center columns for the two vertical 'legs' of the staples, 
       offset horizontally from the midpoint column.
     - Draw two vertical segments (legs) of length 5, centered vertically on the 
       shared row, using the respective pixel colors.
     - Draw two horizontal segments connecting each original pixel to the center 
       of its corresponding vertical leg.
     - Draw a horizontal segment connecting the centers of the two vertical legs, 
       splitting the color at the midpoint column.
   - If the pixels are in the same column (vertical orientation):
     - Calculate the center rows for the two horizontal 'bases' of the staples, 
       offset vertically from the midpoint row.
     - Draw two horizontal segments (bases) of length 5, centered horizontally 
       on the shared column, using the respective pixel colors.
     - Draw two vertical segments connecting each original pixel to the center 
       of its corresponding horizontal base.
     - Draw a vertical segment connecting the centers of the two horizontal bases, 
       splitting the color at the midpoint row.
4. Return the resulting grid.
