"""
This transformation rule identifies two distinct non-background colored pixels 
in the input grid. Based on their relative positions (same row or same column), 
it draws two 'staple' or 'U' shapes. 

If the pixels are in the same row (horizontal orientation):
- Two vertical segments of length 5 are drawn, centered on the shared row (vr), 
  with their columns (vc_left, vc_right) offset from the midpoint column (mc).
- Each original pixel is connected to the center of its corresponding vertical 
  segment by a horizontal line.
- Two horizontal 'prongs' extend from the top ends of the vertical segments 
  towards the midpoint column.
- Two horizontal 'prongs' extend from the bottom ends of the vertical segments 
  towards the midpoint column.

If the pixels are in the same column (vertical orientation):
- Two horizontal segments of length 5 are drawn, centered on the shared column (hc), 
  with their rows (hr_top, hr_bottom) offset from the midpoint row (mr).
- Each original pixel is connected to the center of its corresponding horizontal 
  segment by a vertical line.
- Two vertical 'prongs' extend from the left ends of the horizontal segments 
  towards the midpoint row.
- Two vertical 'prongs' extend from the right ends of the horizontal segments 
  towards the midpoint row.

The color of each staple shape corresponds to the color of its originating pixel. 
The prongs meet or approach each other near the midpoint line/column.
