The background is white (0). The task involves a transformation where one object acts as a mirror, and the other object is reflected vertically across the horizontal axis defined by the mirror object.\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Two separate, single-color objects are present in each input.\n2.  **Mirror Identification:** One of the two input objects remains unchanged in the output grid. This object serves as the \"mirror\".\n3.  **Reflection:** The second object (the one *not* persisting identically) is removed from its original position. A new object, identical in shape and color to this second object, appears in the output grid. This new object's position is a vertical reflection of the original second object's position across the horizontal axis determined by the mirror object.\n4.  **Axis of Reflection:** The reflection occurs across a horizontal line. The exact position of this line is related to the vertical span of the mirror object. Specifically, if a pixel in the object-to-be-mirrored is at row `r`, and the mirror object spans from `min_row` to `max_row`, the reflected pixel will be at row `r_new = (min_row + max_row) - r`. The column `c` remains unchanged.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
