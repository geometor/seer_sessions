task_description: Reflect one object vertically across the horizontal axis of another object.

components:
  - role: background
    value: 0
    color: white
  - role: object
    count: 2
    description: Two distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Each object has a single color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two objects are spatially separated in the input grid.
  - type: identity
    description: One object from the input persists identically in the output grid. This is the 'mirror' object.
  - type: transformation
    object_role: mirrored
    description: The second object from the input does not persist in its original location in the output.
    action: vertical reflection
    reference_object: mirror object
    details: The mirrored object's pixels (r, c) are transformed to (r_new, c), where r_new = (min_row_mirror + max_row_mirror) - r.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: two distinct non-white objects (object_1, object_2)
  - action: identify_mirror
    inputs: input_grid, output_grid, object_1, object_2
    outputs: mirror_object, mirrored_object
    condition: The object present identically in both input and output is the mirror_object.
  - action: calculate_reflection_axis
    inputs: mirror_object
    outputs: axis_sum = min_row(mirror_object) + max_row(mirror_object)
  - action: reflect_object
    inputs: mirrored_object, axis_sum
    outputs: reflected_pixels_coordinates_and_color
    process: For each pixel (r, c) with color C in mirrored_object, calculate r_new = axis_sum - r. The new pixel is (r_new, c) with color C.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: grid_dimensions, mirror_object, reflected_pixels
    outputs: output_grid
    process: Create a white grid. Copy mirror_object pixels. Add reflected_pixels.

properties:
  - grid_size: remains constant between input and output.
  - colors: colors of the objects remain the same after reflection.
