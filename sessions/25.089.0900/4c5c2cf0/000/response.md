Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception**

Each input grid contains exactly two distinct objects, each composed of a single, non-white color. The background is white (0). The task involves a transformation where one object acts as a mirror, and the other object is reflected vertically across the horizontal axis defined by the mirror object.

1.  **Object Identification:** Two separate, single-color objects are present in each input.
2.  **Mirror Identification:** One of the two input objects remains unchanged in the output grid. This object serves as the "mirror".
3.  **Reflection:** The second object (the one *not* persisting identically) is removed from its original position. A new object, identical in shape and color to this second object, appears in the output grid. This new object's position is a vertical reflection of the original second object's position across the horizontal axis determined by the mirror object.
4.  **Axis of Reflection:** The reflection occurs across a horizontal line. The exact position of this line is related to the vertical span of the mirror object. Specifically, if a pixel in the object-to-be-mirrored is at row `r`, and the mirror object spans from `min_row` to `max_row`, the reflected pixel will be at row `r_new = (min_row + max_row) - r`. The column `c` remains unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect one object vertically across the horizontal axis of another object.

components:
  - role: background
    value: 0
    color: white
  - role: object
    count: 2
    description: Two distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Each object has a single color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two objects are spatially separated in the input grid.
  - type: identity
    description: One object from the input persists identically in the output grid. This is the 'mirror' object.
  - type: transformation
    object_role: mirrored
    description: The second object from the input does not persist in its original location in the output.
    action: vertical reflection
    reference_object: mirror object
    details: The mirrored object's pixels (r, c) are transformed to (r_new, c), where r_new = (min_row_mirror + max_row_mirror) - r.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: two distinct non-white objects (object_1, object_2)
  - action: identify_mirror
    inputs: input_grid, output_grid, object_1, object_2
    outputs: mirror_object, mirrored_object
    condition: The object present identically in both input and output is the mirror_object.
  - action: calculate_reflection_axis
    inputs: mirror_object
    outputs: axis_sum = min_row(mirror_object) + max_row(mirror_object)
  - action: reflect_object
    inputs: mirrored_object, axis_sum
    outputs: reflected_pixels_coordinates_and_color
    process: For each pixel (r, c) with color C in mirrored_object, calculate r_new = axis_sum - r. The new pixel is (r_new, c) with color C.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: grid_dimensions, mirror_object, reflected_pixels
    outputs: output_grid
    process: Create a white grid. Copy mirror_object pixels. Add reflected_pixels.

properties:
  - grid_size: remains constant between input and output.
  - colors: colors of the objects remain the same after reflection.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white objects in the input grid. Note their colors and the coordinates of their pixels.
2.  Compare each object from the input grid with the objects in the output grid to find the object that remains in the exact same position. Designate this object as the "mirror object". Designate the other object as the "mirrored object".
3.  Find the minimum row index (`min_r`) and the maximum row index (`max_r`) occupied by the pixels of the mirror object.
4.  Calculate the reflection value `S = min_r + max_r`.
5.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Copy all pixels belonging to the mirror object from the input grid to their same positions in the new grid.
7.  For each pixel belonging to the mirrored object in the input grid, located at `(row, col)` with color `C`:
    a.  Calculate the new row index: `new_row = S - row`.
    b.  Place a pixel with color `C` at coordinates `(new_row, col)` in the new grid.
8.  The new grid is the final output.
