Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception**

Each input grid contains exactly two distinct objects, each composed of a single, non-white color. The background is white (0). The task involves a transformation where one object acts as a mirror, and the other object is reflected vertically across the horizontal axis defined by the mirror object.

1.  **Object Identification:** Two separate, single-color objects are present in each input.
2.  **Mirror Identification:** One of the two input objects remains unchanged in the output grid. This object serves as the "mirror".
3.  **Reflection:** The second object (the one *not* persisting identically) is removed from its original position. A new object, identical in shape and color to this second object, appears in the output grid. This new object's position is a vertical reflection of the original second object's position across the horizontal axis determined by the mirror object.
4.  **Axis of Reflection:** The reflection occurs across a horizontal line. The exact position of this line is related to the vertical span of the mirror object. Specifically, if a pixel in the object-to-be-mirrored is at row `r`, and the mirror object spans from `min_row` to `max_row`, the reflected pixel will be at row `r_new = (min_row + max_row) - r`. The column `c` remains unchanged.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_description: Reflect one object vertically across the horizontal axis of another object.

components:
  - role: background
    value: 0
    color: white
  - role: object
    count: 2
    description: Two distinct contiguous groups of non-white pixels. Each object has a single color.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two objects are spatially separated in the input grid.
  - type: identity
    description: One object from the input persists identically in the output grid. This is the 'mirror' object.
  - type: transformation
    object_role: mirrored
    description: The second object from the input does not persist in its original location in the output.
    action: vertical reflection
    reference_object: mirror object
    details: The mirrored object's pixels (r, c) are transformed to (r_new, c), where r_new = (min_row_mirror + max_row_mirror) - r.

actions:
  - action: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: two distinct non-white objects (object_1, object_2)
  - action: identify_mirror
    inputs: input_grid, output_grid, object_1, object_2
    outputs: mirror_object, mirrored_object
    condition: The object present identically in both input and output is the mirror_object.
  - action: calculate_reflection_axis
    inputs: mirror_object
    outputs: axis_sum = min_row(mirror_object) + max_row(mirror_object)
  - action: reflect_object
    inputs: mirrored_object, axis_sum
    outputs: reflected_pixels_coordinates_and_color
    process: For each pixel (r, c) with color C in mirrored_object, calculate r_new = axis_sum - r. The new pixel is (r_new, c) with color C.
  - action: construct_output
    inputs: grid_dimensions, mirror_object, reflected_pixels
    outputs: output_grid
    process: Create a white grid. Copy mirror_object pixels. Add reflected_pixels.

properties:
  - grid_size: remains constant between input and output.
  - colors: colors of the objects remain the same after reflection.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white objects in the input grid. Note their colors and the coordinates of their pixels.
2.  Compare each object from the input grid with the objects in the output grid to find the object that remains in the exact same position. Designate this object as the "mirror object". Designate the other object as the "mirrored object".
3.  Find the minimum row index (`min_r`) and the maximum row index (`max_r`) occupied by the pixels of the mirror object.
4.  Calculate the reflection value `S = min_r + max_r`.
5.  Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background color (white, 0).
6.  Copy all pixels belonging to the mirror object from the input grid to their same positions in the new grid.
7.  For each pixel belonging to the mirrored object in the input grid, located at `(row, col)` with color `C`:
    a.  Calculate the new row index: `new_row = S - row`.
    b.  Place a pixel with color `C` at coordinates `(new_row, col)` in the new grid.
8.  The new grid is the final output.

**General Assessment**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core mechanism as vertical reflection of one object across another. However, the Python code failed because the rule for identifying the "mirror" object versus the "mirrored" object was incorrectly implemented. The code assumed the physically higher object was the mirror, whereas the examples show the object that *remains unchanged* between input and output serves as the mirror, regardless of its vertical position relative to the other object.

Furthermore, the implementation started by copying the entire input grid and then modifying it. A cleaner approach is to start with a blank (background color) grid and place the persistent (mirror) object and the newly reflected object onto it.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the object identification process to explicitly find the object that persists between input and output grids (this is the mirror).
2.  Confirm the reflection calculation (`r_new = min_row_mirror + max_row_mirror - r_original`) is correct.
3.  Adjust the output grid construction: start with a background grid, add the mirror object, then add the reflected version of the other object.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze the properties of the objects in each training example to confirm the pattern.

**Error Analysis:** The first analysis code failed because the logic for matching objects between input and output was too simple and didn't correctly handle the case where the *order* of objects found by `find_objects` might differ between input and output. The second attempt (`analyze_example_revised`) uses nested loops to explicitly find the matching (persistent) object regardless of order, which is more robust. Let's re-run the *second* analysis code.

**Further Error Analysis:** The revised analysis code is *also* failing. The error messages "Expected 2 objects in input and output, found X and Y" indicate that the `find_objects` function is incorrectly identifying multiple small objects instead of two larger, potentially non-contiguous shapes as single objects. Looking back at the examples:
*   Example 1: The green 'object' (3) is actually three separate pixels. The azure 'object' (8) is contiguous. The output green object is also three separate pixels. The output azure object is contiguous.
*   Example 2: The red 'object' (2) is made of multiple contiguous parts. The yellow 'object' (4) is three separate pixels. The output red object is multiple contiguous parts (same as input). The output yellow object is three separate pixels (reflected).
*   Example 3: The azure 'object' (8) is three separate pixels. The blue 'object' (1) is made of multiple contiguous parts. The output azure object is three separate pixels (same as input). The output blue object is multiple contiguous parts (reflected).

**Correction:** The concept of an "object" in this task is not necessarily a single *contiguous* block of color. Instead, it seems to be *all pixels of a specific non-background color* should be treated as a single entity for the purpose of identifying the mirror and performing the reflection. The `find_objects` function needs to group by color, not by contiguity.

Let's adjust the analysis code and metrics gathering based on this understanding.

**Astonishing Error Discovery:** The latest analysis code, which correctly identifies objects by color and finds the persistent (mirror) object, reveals a critical mismatch: the *number of pixels* (`Count`) of the mirrored object in the input is *different* from the number of pixels of the reflected object in the output.

Let's re-examine the input/output pairs visually *very* carefully.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Green (3): 5 pixels. Coords: (6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6). MinR=6, MaxR=8.
    *   Input Azure (8): 7 pixels. Coords: (3,8), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). MinR=3, MaxR=5.
    *   Output Green (3): 5 pixels. Coords same as input. -> **Mirror is GREEN (3)**.
    *   Output Azure (8): 28 pixels (a 4x copy). -> **Mirrored is AZURE (8)**.
    *   Mirror (Green) MinR=6, MaxR=8. Axis Sum = 6 + 8 = 14.
    *   Input Azure Coords: (3,8), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)
    *   Expected Reflected Coords: (14-3,8)=(11,8), (14-4,7)=(10,7), (14-4,8)=(10,8), (14-4,9)=(10,9), (14-5,6)=(9,6), (14-5,7)=(9,7), (14-5,8)=(9,8).
    *   Actual Output Azure Coords: These seem to match the expected reflected coordinates but... wait, the output shows *four* copies of the azure shape? Let's check the provided output image again. Yes, it shows the original green shape, and then four copies of the azure shape. Two are reflections (one vertical, one horizontal? No, looks like vertical reflection and then copies). This task is significantly more complex than simple reflection.

*   **Re-evaluating the Transformation:** The output doesn't just contain the mirror and a single reflection. It contains the mirror object and *multiple copies* of the other object, placed symmetrically around the mirror object.

Let's re-analyze Example 1 based on Green (3) being the mirror:
*   Mirror = Green pixels at (6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,6). MinR=6, MaxR=8. Axis Sum = 14.
*   Object to copy = Azure pixels at (3,8), (4,7-9), (5,6-8).
*   Output contains:
    1.  Original Green mirror.
    2.  Original Azure object *shifted*? No, the original Azure object is *gone*.
    3.  Azure shape reflected vertically: Pixels at rows 9-11. `r_new = 14 - r_orig`. (5,6) -> (9,6), (4,7) -> (10,7), (3,8) -> (11,8). Yes, this matches the lower Azure copy.
    4.  Azure shape reflected horizontally across the *vertical centerline* of the mirror? Mirror `min_c=4`, `max_c=6`. Centerline `(4+6)/2 = 5`. `c_new = (min_c + max_c) - c_orig = 10 - c_orig`.
        *   Original Azure at (3,8), (4,7-9), (5,6-8).
        *   Reflected Horizontally (around C=5): (3, 10-8=2), (4, 10-7=3), (4, 10-8=2), (4, 10-9=1), (5, 10-6=4), (5, 10-7=3), (5, 10-8=2). These pixels are NOT present in the output.
    5.  Wait, the output azure shapes are at the same rows as the original input azure shape (rows 3,4,5) AND reflected rows (9,10,11). And they are also reflected horizontally across the *vertical axis of the input azure shape itself*? Input Azure `min_c=6`, `max_c=9`. Center `(6+9)/2 = 7.5`. Axis Sum = 15. `c_new = 15 - c_orig`.
        *   Original Azure at (3,8), (4,7-9), (5,6-8). Let's call this Top-Right (TR).
        *   Output contains TR.
        *   Output contains Vertically Reflected (VR): (11,8), (10,7-9), (9,6-8). (Bottom-Right, BR).
        *   Output contains Horizontally Reflected TR (around c=7.5): (3, 15-8=7), (4, 15-7=8), (4, 15-8=7), (4, 15-9=6), (5, 15-6=9), (5, 15-7=8), (5, 15-8=7). This is Top-Left (TL).
        *   Output contains Horizontally Reflected BR (around c=7.5): (11, 7), (10, 8,7,6), (9, 9,8,7). This is Bottom-Left (BL).
    6.  Comparing with `out1_prompt`:
        *   TR Azure: (3,8), (4,7-9), (5,6-8) -> YES.
        *   BR Azure (VR): (9,6-8), (10,7-9), (11,8) -> YES.
        *   TL Azure (HR of TR): (3,7), (4,6-8), (5,7-9) -> YES. The columns are shifted left compared to TR. Let's recheck calculation: (3, 15-8=7), (4, 15-7=8), (4, 15-8=7), (4, 15-9=6), (5, 15-6=9), (5, 15-7=8), (5, 15-8=7). These match the pixels in the top-left of the output.
        *   BL Azure (HR of BR): (9,7-9), (10,6-8), (11,7) -> YES. Matches bottom-left of output.

**Revised Understanding:**
1.  Identify the two colors (color A, color B).
2.  Determine which color's pixels remain *identically* in the same position from input to output. This is the "mirror" color (e.g., Green in Ex1).
3.  The other color is the "pattern" color (e.g., Azure in Ex1).
4.  Define the vertical reflection axis based on the mirror object: `axis_sum_V = mirror_min_r + mirror_max_r`.
5.  Define the horizontal reflection axis based on the *pattern* object: `axis_sum_H = pattern_min_c + pattern_max_c`.
6.  The output grid contains:
    *   The original mirror object pixels.
    *   The original pattern object pixels (Top-Right, TR).
    *   The pattern object reflected vertically across `axis_sum_V` (Bottom-Right, BR): `(axis_sum_V - r, c)`
    *   The pattern object reflected horizontally across `axis_sum_H` (Top-Left, TL): `(r, axis_sum_H - c)`
    *   The pattern object reflected vertically *and* horizontally (Bottom-Left, BL): `(axis_sum_V - r, axis_sum_H - c)`

Let's test this on Example 3:
*   Input Blue (1): Multiple parts. MinR=9, MaxR=11. MinC=1, MaxC=3.
*   Input Azure (8): 3 pixels: (6,4), (7,5), (8,4), (6,6), (8,6). MinR=6, MaxR=8. MinC=4, MaxC=6.
*   Output Azure (8): Same pixels as input. -> **Mirror is AZURE (8)**.
*   Output Blue (1): 20 pixels (4 copies of 5). -> **Pattern is BLUE (1)**.
*   Mirror (Azure) MinR=6, MaxR=8. Axis Sum V = 6+8=14.
*   Pattern (Blue) MinC=1, MaxC=3. Axis Sum H = 1+3=4.
*   Input Blue Coords (TR): (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,2).
*   Check Output:
    *   Mirror Azure: Yes.
    *   TR Blue: (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,2) -> Yes (Bottom-Left in output grid).
    *   BR Blue (VR): (14-9,2)=(5,2), (14-9,3)=(5,3), (14-10,1)=(4,1), (14-10,3)=(4,3), (14-11,2)=(3,2) -> Yes (Top-Left in output grid).
    *   TL Blue (HR): (9, 4-2=2), (9, 4-3=1), (10, 4-1=3), (10, 4-3=1), (11, 4-2=2). -> Input coords were (9,2),(9,3),(10,1),(10,3),(11,2). HR coords are (9,2),(9,1),(10,3),(10,1),(11,2). Wait, the output has these at columns 8,9. Let's recheck Axis Sum H. Blue `min_c=1`, `max_c=3`. `axis_sum_H = 1 + 3 = 4`. Example 3 output Blue coords are at C={1,2,3} and C={8,9}. Where does C={8,9} come from?
    *   Maybe the horizontal axis isn't the pattern's axis, but the *mirror's* axis? Mirror Azure `min_c=4`, `max_c=6`. `axis_sum_H = 4 + 6 = 10`.
    *   HR with axis=10: (9, 10-2=8), (9, 10-3=7), (10, 10-1=9), (10, 10-3=7), (11, 10-2=8). -> These are the columns C={7,8,9}. The output has C={8,9}. Still doesn't quite match.

Let's reconsider the axes. Vertical axis is `mirror_min_r + mirror_max_r`. Horizontal axis? Maybe it's related to the grid dimensions or the *gap* between objects?

Maybe it's simpler: The mirror object stays. The pattern object is copied 4 times symmetrically relative to the mirror's center? No, the horizontal reflection axis seems specific.

What if the horizontal reflection is around the *vertical* axis of symmetry of the *mirror* object?
Ex 1: Mirror (Green) spans C=4 to C=6. Center=(4+6)/2=5. Axis Sum H = 10.
Pattern (Azure) coords C={6,7,8,9}. Reflected C = 10-C = {4,3,2,1}.
Original R={3,4,5}. VR R={9,10,11}.
Output TL C={1,2,3,4}. Output BL C={1,2,3,4}. Matches output!

Ex 3: Mirror (Azure) spans C=4 to C=6. Center=5. Axis Sum H = 10.
Pattern (Blue) coords C={1,2,3}. Reflected C = 10-C = {9,8,7}.
Original R={9,10,11}. VR R={3,4,5}.
Output TR C={1,2,3}. Output BR C={1,2,3}.
Output TL C={7,8,9}. Output BL C={7,8,9}. Matches output!

**Final Hypothesis:**
1. Identify mirror object (persists identically) and pattern object (the other one).
2. Calculate Vertical Reflection Axis Sum: `axis_sum_V = mirror_min_r + mirror_max_r`.
3. Calculate Horizontal Reflection Axis Sum: `axis_sum_H = mirror_min_c + mirror_max_c`.
4. Create blank output grid.
5. Copy mirror object to output.
6. For each pixel `(r, c)` of the input pattern object:
    a. Draw original pixel: `output[r, c] = pattern_color` (TR)
    b. Draw Vertically Reflected: `output[axis_sum_V - r, c] = pattern_color` (BR)
    c. Draw Horizontally Reflected: `output[r, axis_sum_H - c] = pattern_color` (TL)
    d. Draw Both Reflected: `output[axis_sum_V - r, axis_sum_H - c] = pattern_color` (BL)
    (Ensure reflected coordinates are within grid bounds).

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the two distinct non-white colors present in the input grid.
2.  For each color, find all pixels belonging to it. Treat all pixels of one color as a single logical "object". Determine the minimum/maximum row/column boundaries for each object.
3.  Compare the pixel coordinates of each colored object in the input grid to the coordinates of objects with the same color in the output grid. Identify the object whose color and pixel coordinates are identical in both input and output. Designate this object as the "mirror object".
4.  Designate the *other* object (whose coordinates differ or are absent in the output compared to the input) as the "pattern object".
5.  Calculate the vertical reflection axis sum using the mirror object's bounds: `axis_sum_V = mirror_object.min_row + mirror_object.max_row`.
6.  Calculate the horizontal reflection axis sum using the mirror object's bounds: `axis_sum_H = mirror_object.min_col + mirror_object.max_col`.
7.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color (white, 0).
8.  Copy all pixels belonging to the mirror object from the input grid to their same positions in the new output grid.
9.  Iterate through each pixel `(r, c)` belonging to the pattern object in the *input* grid. Let its color be `P`.
    a.  Calculate the vertically reflected row: `r_vr = axis_sum_V - r`.
    b.  Calculate the horizontally reflected column: `c_hr = axis_sum_H - c`.
    c.  Place pixel `P` at `(r, c)` in the output grid (if `r`, `c` are within grid bounds).
    d.  Place pixel `P` at `(r_vr, c)` in the output grid (if `r_vr`, `c` are within grid bounds).
    e.  Place pixel `P` at `(r, c_hr)` in the output grid (if `r`, `c_hr` are within grid bounds).
    f.  Place pixel `P` at `(r_vr, c_hr)` in the output grid (if `r_vr`, `c_hr` are within grid bounds).
10. The new grid is the final output.
