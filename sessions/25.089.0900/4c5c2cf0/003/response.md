"""
Identifies two distinct color objects in the input grid. Determines which object 
is the 'mirror' and which is the 'pattern' based on the number of contiguous 
components each object has (the object with more components is the mirror). 
Calculates the vertical and horizontal reflection axes based on the min/max row/col 
of the mirror object. Creates an output grid containing the mirror object in its 
original position and four copies of the pattern object: the original, one reflected 
vertically, one reflected horizontally, and one reflected both vertically and horizontally, 
all relative to the mirror's axes.
