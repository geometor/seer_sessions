Objects:
  - Type: HollowRectangle
    Color: Green (3)
    Properties:
      - Defined by horizontal and vertical segments of green pixels.
      - Interior is typically white (0).
      - Position and dimensions vary.
  - Type: Marker
    Color: Magenta (6)
    Properties:
      - Single pixel.
      - Position varies.

Relationships:
  - Alignment:
      - Horizontal: A Marker shares the same row index as at least one pixel of a HollowRectangle.
      - Vertical: A Marker shares the same column index as at least one pixel of a HollowRectangle.
  - Spatial: Markers can be inside, outside, horizontally aligned, or vertically aligned with the bounding box of the green pixels.

Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all HollowRectangles and Markers in the input grid.
  - Analyze Alignment: Determine if any Markers are horizontally aligned with any green pixels. Determine if any Markers are vertically aligned with any green pixels.
  - Prioritize Direction: Horizontal alignment takes precedence over vertical alignment.
  - Determine Target Boundary:
      - If horizontal alignment exists: Find the horizontally aligned Marker furthest from the green shapes (max or min column index). The target boundary is the column adjacent (column-1 for right, column+1 for left) to this Marker.
      - If only vertical alignment exists: Find the vertically aligned Marker furthest from the green shapes (max or min row index). The target boundary is the row adjacent (row-1 for bottom, row+1 for top) to this Marker.
  - Modify Rectangles:
      - For each HollowRectangle:
          - Extend the side(s) facing the target boundary (e.g., extend the right vertical segment if the target boundary is to the right) to reach the target boundary column/row.
          - Fill the newly created area between the original side and the extended side with green (3) pixels.
  - Preserve: Keep the Marker pixels unchanged in the output grid.
