The even-numbered columns (0, 2, 4, ...) contain various colors (red (2), gray (5), azure (8), blue (1), orange (7)), while the odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...) in the input consist entirely of orange (7) pixels.\n    *   Two specific rows act as markers or delimiters: one row contains red (2) pixels in its even columns, and the row immediately below it contains gray (5) pixels in its even columns. Let's call these the \"red marker row\" and the \"gray marker row\".\n    *   The transformation heavily depends on the column index (even or odd) and the row index relative to these two marker rows.\n    *   The output grid modifies the colors in both even and odd columns based on these relative positions.\n    *   **Odd columns:** The orange (7) pixels in the odd columns are replaced by azure (8) in rows up to and including the red marker row, by blue (1) in the gray marker row, and by maroon (9) in all rows below the gray marker row.\n    *   **Even columns:** The pixels in the even columns are mostly unchanged, except:\n        *   In the gray marker row, any azure (8) pixel becomes blue (1).\n        *   In rows below the gray marker row, any azure (8) or blue (1) pixel becomes maroon (9).\n        *   Other colors (red (2), gray (5), orange (7)) in even columns remain unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
