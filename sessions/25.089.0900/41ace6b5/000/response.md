*   **Perception of the Elements:**
    *   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
    *   The grids consist primarily of orange (7) pixels, with patterns embedded within.
    *   There are distinct vertical stripes. The even-numbered columns (0, 2, 4, ...) contain various colors (red (2), gray (5), azure (8), blue (1), orange (7)), while the odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, ...) in the input consist entirely of orange (7) pixels.
    *   Two specific rows act as markers or delimiters: one row contains red (2) pixels in its even columns, and the row immediately below it contains gray (5) pixels in its even columns. Let's call these the "red marker row" and the "gray marker row".
    *   The transformation heavily depends on the column index (even or odd) and the row index relative to these two marker rows.
    *   The output grid modifies the colors in both even and odd columns based on these relative positions.
    *   **Odd columns:** The orange (7) pixels in the odd columns are replaced by azure (8) in rows up to and including the red marker row, by blue (1) in the gray marker row, and by maroon (9) in all rows below the gray marker row.
    *   **Even columns:** The pixels in the even columns are mostly unchanged, except:
        *   In the gray marker row, any azure (8) pixel becomes blue (1).
        *   In rows below the gray marker row, any azure (8) or blue (1) pixel becomes maroon (9).
        *   Other colors (red (2), gray (5), orange (7)) in even columns remain unchanged.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions_preserved: True
      - background_color: 7 # orange, predominantly in odd columns initially

    objects:
      - type: marker_row
        color: 2 # red
        location: Found in even columns of a specific row (red_marker_row).
      - type: marker_row
        color: 5 # gray
        location: Found in even columns of the row immediately below red_marker_row (gray_marker_row).
      - type: column_type
        property: parity
        values: [even, odd]

    relationships:
      - marker_rows: The gray_marker_row is always directly below the red_marker_row.
      - row_regions: The transformation logic depends on whether a row is above/at the red_marker_row, is the gray_marker_row, or is below the gray_marker_row.
      - column_parity_dependency: Transformation rules differ significantly for odd and even columns.

    actions:
      - name: find_marker_rows
        input: input_grid
        output: row indices for red_marker_row and gray_marker_row.
      - name: transform_odd_columns
        conditions:
          - based on row index relative to marker rows
        color_changes:
          - if row <= red_marker_row: 7 -> 8 (azure)
          - if row == gray_marker_row: 7 -> 1 (blue)
          - if row > gray_marker_row: 7 -> 9 (maroon)
      - name: transform_even_columns
        conditions:
          - based on row index relative to marker rows AND original pixel color
        color_changes:
          - if row == gray_marker_row and color == 8 (azure): 8 -> 1 (blue)
          - if row > gray_marker_row and (color == 8 (azure) or color == 1 (blue)): color -> 9 (maroon)
          - otherwise: color remains unchanged
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    2.  Scan the input grid to find the row index containing red (2) pixels; this is the `red_marker_row_index`.
    3.  Scan the input grid to find the row index containing gray (5) pixels; this is the `gray_marker_row_index`. (This will always be `red_marker_row_index + 1`).
    4.  Iterate through each cell of the grid using its row index `r` and column index `c`.
    5.  **If the column index `c` is odd:**
        *   If the row index `r` is less than or equal to `red_marker_row_index`, set the output grid cell `output[r][c]` to azure (8).
        *   If the row index `r` is equal to `gray_marker_row_index`, set the output grid cell `output[r][c]` to blue (1).
        *   If the row index `r` is greater than `gray_marker_row_index`, set the output grid cell `output[r][c]` to maroon (9).
    6.  **If the column index `c` is even:**
        *   Get the original color `original_color = input[r][c]`.
        *   If the row index `r` is equal to `gray_marker_row_index` AND `original_color` is azure (8), set the output grid cell `output[r][c]` to blue (1).
        *   If the row index `r` is greater than `gray_marker_row_index` AND (`original_color` is azure (8) OR `original_color` is blue (1)), set the output grid cell `output[r][c]` to maroon (9).
        *   Otherwise (for all other conditions in even columns), the output cell `output[r][c]` retains its `original_color` (copied initially).
    7.  Return the modified output grid.
