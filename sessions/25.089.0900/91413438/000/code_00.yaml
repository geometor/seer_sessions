Context:
  Input_Grid_Dimensions: Fixed at 3x3 for all examples.
  Output_Grid_Dimensions: Variable square dimensions (Height x Height), always a multiple of 3.
  Pixel_Colors: Input contains white (0) and exactly one other non-white color.

Objects:
  - name: Input_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - pixels: array of integers 0-9
  - name: Output_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [H_out, W_out] where H_out = W_out
      - pixels: array of integers 0-9 derived from Input_Grid
  - name: Non_White_Pixels
    properties:
      - count: N (number of pixels in Input_Grid with value > 0)
      - color: C (the single non-white color value present in Input_Grid)
  - name: White_Pixels
    properties:
      - count: W (number of pixels in Input_Grid with value == 0)

Relationships:
  - name: Tiling_Factor
    definition: The number of times the Input_Grid is repeated horizontally and vertically to form the Output_Grid.
    symbol: T
    derivation: T = W (count of white pixels) or equivalently T = 9 - N (9 minus count of non-white pixels).
  - name: Output_Size_Determination
    definition: The dimensions of the Output_Grid are determined by the Tiling_Factor and Input_Grid dimensions.
    formula: H_out = 3 * T, W_out = 3 * T

Actions:
  - Count the number of non-white pixels (N) in the Input_Grid.
  - Calculate the Tiling_Factor (T = 9 - N).
  - Create an Output_Grid with dimensions (3*T) x (3*T).
  - Populate the Output_Grid by tiling the Input_Grid T times horizontally and T times vertically.
