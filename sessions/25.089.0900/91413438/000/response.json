Let the input dimensions be `H_in` x `W_in` (here, 3x3) and output dimensions be `H_out` x `W_out`. The output dimensions are determined by a tiling factor `T`, such that `H_out = H_in * T` and `W_out = W_in * T`.\n6.  **Determining the Tiling Factor (T):**\n    *   Example 1: Input (3x3) has 6 non-white pixels (green). Output is 9x9. `T = 9 / 3 = 3`.\n    *   Example 2: Input (3x3) has 4 non-white pixels (yellow). Output is 15x15. `T = 15 / 3 = 5`.\n    *   Example 3: Input (3x3) has 3 non-white pixels (red). Output is 18x18. `T = 18 / 3 = 6`.\n    *   Example 4: Input (3x3) has 5 non-white pixels (magenta). Output is 12x12. `T = 12 / 3 = 4`.\n7.  **Pattern in Tiling Factor:** Let `N` be the count of non-white pixels in the 3x3 input grid.\n    *   N=6 -> T=3\n    *   N=4 -> T=5\n    *   N=3 -> T=6\n    *   N=5 -> T=4\n    The pattern appears to be `T = 9 - N`. Since the input grid is 3x3 (total 9 cells), `T` is equal to the number of *white* pixels in the input grid.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
