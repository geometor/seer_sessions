Context:
  Input_Grid_Dimensions: Fixed at 3x3.
  Output_Grid_Dimensions: Variable square dimensions (Height x Height), derived from input properties.
  Pixel_Colors: Input contains white (0) and exactly one other non-white color.

Objects:
  - name: Input_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - pixels: array of integers 0-9
  - name: Output_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [H_out, W_out]
      - pixels: array of integers 0-9 derived from Input_Grid and placement rules.
      - background_color: white (0)
  - name: Non_White_Pixels
    properties:
      - count: N (number of pixels in Input_Grid with value > 0)
      - color: C (the single non-white color value present in Input_Grid)
  - name: White_Pixels
    properties:
      - count: T (number of pixels in Input_Grid with value == 0)

Relationships:
  - name: Output_Size_Factor
    definition: A factor determining the output grid size based on the Input_Grid content.
    symbol: T
    derivation: T = count of white pixels in Input_Grid (T = 9 - N).
  - name: Output_Size_Determination
    definition: The dimensions of the Output_Grid are determined by the Output_Size_Factor and Input_Grid dimensions.
    formula: H_out = 3 * T, W_out = 3 * T
  - name: Tile_Placement_Count
    definition: The number of times the Input_Grid pattern is copied into the Output_Grid.
    symbol: N
    derivation: N = count of non-white pixels in Input_Grid.
  - name: Tile_Placement_Grid_Width
    definition: The maximum number of Input_Grid copies that can fit horizontally within one 'row' of tiles in the Output_Grid.
    symbol: Tile_Grid_Width
    derivation: Tile_Grid_Width = T

Actions:
  - Count non-white pixels (N) in Input_Grid.
  - Count white pixels (T) in Input_Grid (T = 9 - N).
  - Create an Output_Grid of size (3*T) x (3*T), initialized with white (0).
  - Place N copies of the Input_Grid pattern into the Output_Grid.
  - Placement Rule: Iterate from copy_index = 0 to N-1.
    - Calculate the tile row: `tile_row = copy_index // T`
    - Calculate the tile column: `tile_col = copy_index % T`
    - Calculate output pixel coordinates for the top-left corner of the copy:
      `output_row = tile_row * 3`
      `output_col = tile_col * 3`
    - Copy the 3x3 Input_Grid to the Output_Grid at `[output_row : output_row+3, output_col : output_col+3]`.
