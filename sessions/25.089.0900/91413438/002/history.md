Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Grid:** All input grids are 3x3.
2.  **Output Grid:** The output grids are larger squares, with dimensions that are multiples of 3 (9x9, 15x15, 18x18, 12x12).
3.  **Content:** The output grid appears to be constructed by repeating or "tiling" the input grid pattern.
4.  **Colors:** Each input grid contains white pixels (0) and pixels of exactly one other color (green, yellow, red, magenta).
5.  **Relationship between Input and Output Size:** The size of the output grid seems related to the content of the input grid. Let the input dimensions be `H_in` x `W_in` (here, 3x3) and output dimensions be `H_out` x `W_out`. The output dimensions are determined by a tiling factor `T`, such that `H_out = H_in * T` and `W_out = W_in * T`.
6.  **Determining the Tiling Factor (T):**
    *   Example 1: Input (3x3) has 6 non-white pixels (green). Output is 9x9. `T = 9 / 3 = 3`.
    *   Example 2: Input (3x3) has 4 non-white pixels (yellow). Output is 15x15. `T = 15 / 3 = 5`.
    *   Example 3: Input (3x3) has 3 non-white pixels (red). Output is 18x18. `T = 18 / 3 = 6`.
    *   Example 4: Input (3x3) has 5 non-white pixels (magenta). Output is 12x12. `T = 12 / 3 = 4`.
7.  **Pattern in Tiling Factor:** Let `N` be the count of non-white pixels in the 3x3 input grid.
    *   N=6 -> T=3
    *   N=4 -> T=5
    *   N=3 -> T=6
    *   N=5 -> T=4
    The pattern appears to be `T = 9 - N`. Since the input grid is 3x3 (total 9 cells), `T` is equal to the number of *white* pixels in the input grid.

**Facts**


```yaml
Context:
  Input_Grid_Dimensions: Fixed at 3x3 for all examples.
  Output_Grid_Dimensions: Variable square dimensions (Height x Height), always a multiple of 3.
  Pixel_Colors: Input contains white (0) and exactly one other non-white color.

Objects:
  - name: Input_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [3, 3]
      - pixels: array of integers 0-9
  - name: Output_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [H_out, W_out] where H_out = W_out
      - pixels: array of integers 0-9 derived from Input_Grid
  - name: Non_White_Pixels
    properties:
      - count: N (number of pixels in Input_Grid with value > 0)
      - color: C (the single non-white color value present in Input_Grid)
  - name: White_Pixels
    properties:
      - count: W (number of pixels in Input_Grid with value == 0)

Relationships:
  - name: Tiling_Factor
    definition: The number of times the Input_Grid is repeated horizontally and vertically to form the Output_Grid.
    symbol: T
    derivation: T = W (count of white pixels) or equivalently T = 9 - N (9 minus count of non-white pixels).
  - name: Output_Size_Determination
    definition: The dimensions of the Output_Grid are determined by the Tiling_Factor and Input_Grid dimensions.
    formula: H_out = 3 * T, W_out = 3 * T

Actions:
  - Count the number of non-white pixels (N) in the Input_Grid.
  - Calculate the Tiling_Factor (T = 9 - N).
  - Create an Output_Grid with dimensions (3*T) x (3*T).
  - Populate the Output_Grid by tiling the Input_Grid T times horizontally and T times vertically.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Count the number of pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (value is not 0). Let this count be `N`.
3.  Calculate the tiling factor `T` by subtracting `N` from 9 (the total number of cells in the 3x3 input grid): `T = 9 - N`.
4.  Determine the dimensions of the output grid: the height will be `3 * T` and the width will be `3 * T`.
5.  Construct the output grid by repeating the 3x3 input grid pattern `T` times horizontally and `T` times vertically, creating a `T`x`T` grid of the original input pattern.
```python
"""
Transformation Description:

1.  Analyze the input 3x3 grid.
2.  Count the number of non-white pixels (pixels with value > 0). Let this count be N.
3.  Calculate a tiling factor T, which is equal to the number of white pixels (pixels with value == 0) in the input grid. Since the input is 3x3 (9 total cells), T = 9 - N.
4.  Create an output grid whose dimensions are (3 * T) height and (3 * T) width.
5.  Populate the output grid by repeating the original 3x3 input grid pattern T times horizontally and T times vertically, effectively tiling the output grid with the input pattern.
