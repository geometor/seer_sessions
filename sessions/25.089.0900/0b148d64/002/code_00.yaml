task_description: Extract a specific sub-pattern located below a horizontal white separator in the input grid.

elements:
  - element: grid
    role: input
    properties:
      - contains an upper pattern, a separator, and a lower section
      - upper pattern: consists primarily of one non-white color (`upper_color`) and white pixels
      - separator: one or more contiguous rows containing only white pixels (0)
      - lower section: rows below the separator; may contain multiple non-white colors, including potentially `upper_color` and another distinct non-white color (`lower_color`)

  - element: grid
    role: output
    properties:
      - is a subgrid of the input
      - contains only `lower_color` and white pixels (0)
      - dimensions match the minimal bounding box enclosing all `lower_color` pixels found in the lower section of the input grid

relationships:
  - type: separation
    between: upper pattern, lower section
    via: horizontal rows of white pixels (separator)
  - type: identification
    subject: lower_color
    condition: non-white color present in the lower section AND different from `upper_color`
  - type: bounding_box
    target: pixels of `lower_color`
    scope: within the rows of the lower section of the input grid
  - type: extraction
    source: input grid
    target: output grid
    details: The output grid is the content of the input grid within the calculated bounding box.

actions:
  - action: locate_separator
    description: Find the contiguous block of rows containing only white pixels. Identify the last row index of this block (`separator_end_row`).
  - action: identify_upper_color
    description: Find the unique non-white color present in the rows above `separator_end_row + 1`.
  - action: identify_lower_section_colors
    description: Find all unique non-white colors present in the rows from `separator_end_row + 1` onwards.
  - action: determine_target_color
    description: Select the color from `identify_lower_section_colors` that is not equal to `identify_upper_color`. This is `lower_color`.
  - action: find_target_pixels_coords
    description: Find the row and column indices of all pixels in the lower section (rows >= `separator_end_row + 1`) that have the value `lower_color`.
  - action: calculate_bounding_box
    description: Determine the minimum row, maximum row, minimum column, and maximum column from the coordinates found in `find_target_pixels_coords`.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Copy the portion of the input grid defined by the calculated bounding box row and column ranges to create the output grid.
