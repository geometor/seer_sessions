            "text": "*   **Perception:**\n    *   The task involves transforming grids containing white (0), azure (8), and red (2) pixels.\n    *   The transformation logic appears to depend on the initial positions of the azure and red pixels.\n    *   Two distinct transformation modes are observed based on the input configuration:\n        1.  **Mode 1 (Examples 1 & 2):** Triggered when azure pixels are present in the first row (row 0). Azure pixels in the first row define a vertical pattern. This pattern propagates downwards. When a row containing a red pixel (acting as a trigger) is encountered in the input, the pattern shifts one column to the left for subsequent rows. The propagated azure pattern only colors pixels that were originally white in the input grid; existing non-white pixels (like the red triggers) are preserved.\n        2.  **Mode 2 (Example 3):** Triggered when no azure pixels are in the first row, but azure pixels *are* present in the first column (column 0). Each azure pixel in the first column at row `r` triggers the drawing of three horizontal, 4-pixel-wide azure blocks in the output: one starting at `(r, 0)`, one at `(r-1, 4)`, and one at `(r-2, 8)`. These blocks overwrite existing pixels in the output grid at their locations. All other pixels from the input grid (like the red pixels in Example 3) are preserved in their original positions unless overwritten by the drawn blocks.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
