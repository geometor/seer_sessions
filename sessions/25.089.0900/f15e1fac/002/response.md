    *   The calculation confirms the hypothesis:
        *   Example 1: Width 10, Midpoint 5.0. Triggers at col 9 (>= 5.0). Shift left.
        *   Example 2: Width 12, Midpoint 6.0. Triggers at col 0 (< 6.0). Shift right.
    *   Also, I need to be careful about the application: initialize output as a copy, *then* apply the pattern changes. The current code does this, but the *logic* of applying the pattern needs to incorporate the shift *before* modification for the trigger row. The code applies the *old* pattern to the trigger row, then calculates the *new* pattern for the *next* row. This is wrong.
    *   Revised Mode 1 Logic:
        1.  Initialize output grid as a copy of the input.
        2.  Get initial pattern `P` from row 0 azure columns.
        3.  Iterate `r` from 0 to height-1:
            a.  Check for red triggers in `input[r, :]`.
            b.  If triggers exist:
                i.   Find the column `c_trig` of the first trigger (e.g., smallest column index).
                ii.  Calculate midpoint `M = width / 2`.
                iii. If `c_trig < M`, shift `P` right by 1 (add 1 to each col index, discard cols >= width).
                iv. If `c_trig >= M`, shift `P` left by 1 (subtract 1 from each col index, discard cols < 0).
            c.  Apply the (potentially updated) pattern `P`: for each column `c` in `P`, if `input[r, c]` is white (0), set `output[r, c]` to azure (8). (Crucially, *do not* overwrite the red triggers or other non-white input pixels when applying the pattern).

4.  **Re-examine Mode 2 Logic:** Example 3 worked perfectly. The logic seems correct: Copy input to output, find triggers `(r, 0)` where value is 8, and draw the three 4-pixel blocks starting at `(r, 0)`, `(r-1, 4)`, `(r-2, 8)`, overwriting whatever was there.

5.  **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:** Reflect the refined Mode 1 logic, specifically the trigger-location-dependent shift direction and applying the shifted pattern *starting* on the trigger row itself.

6.  **Consider Edge Cases (Self-Correction):**
    *   What if a shift moves a pattern column index out of bounds (negative or >= width)? My logic says discard them. This seems correct based on Example 1 (shift left eventually eliminated columns). Need to ensure the right shift also handles the upper bound correctly.
    *   What if a row contains multiple red triggers, some left, some right? My current plan uses the *first* trigger (lowest column index). This seems a reasonable starting point given the examples.
    *   What if the pattern becomes empty after shifts? The loop applying the pattern will simply do nothing, which seems correct.
    *   Does applying the pattern overwrite the trigger? The logic should be: apply pattern `P` only where `input[r, c]` is white (0). This prevents overwriting the red trigger or any other non-white input pixel *unless* the Mode 2 block drawing overwrites it (which is expected in Mode 2). Let's refine the description to be clearer: In Mode 1, azure pattern only replaces white. In Mode 2, azure blocks replace anything.

7.  **Final Check:** Does the refined Mode 1 logic now correctly explain both Example 1 and Example 2? Yes, it seems to. Example 3 (Mode 2) was already correct.## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code correctly identified the two primary modes of operation based on the placement of azure (8) pixels (either in the first row or first column). Mode 2 (Horizontal Blocks triggered by column 0 azure) was implemented correctly, as shown by the success on Example 3.

Mode 1 (Vertical Shift triggered by row 0 azure) was implemented incorrectly. The discrepancies in Examples 1 and 2 reveal two key errors in the original understanding:
1.  **Shift Timing:** The pattern shift triggered by a red (2) pixel was applied *after* processing the trigger row in the code. The examples show the shift should take effect *starting* on the row where the trigger appears.
2.  **Shift Direction:** The initial assumption was always a left shift. Comparing Example 1 (trigger on right, shift left) and Example 2 (trigger on left, shift right) indicates the shift direction depends on the horizontal position of the trigger pixel relative to the grid's midpoint.

**Strategy:**
1.  Refine the logic for Mode 1 to incorporate the correct shift timing (apply shift *before* processing the trigger row).
2.  Implement the trigger-position-dependent shift direction (left trigger -> shift right, right trigger -> shift left).
3.  Clarify that in Mode 1, the azure pattern only overwrites white (0) pixels in the input, preserving other original pixels like the red triggers.
4.  Keep Mode 2 logic as is, as it passed its test case.
5.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this corrected understanding.

## Metrics and Analysis

*   **Example 1 (Mode 1 - Trigger Right):**
    *   Input Size: 14x10
    *   Mode Trigger: Azure (8) at (0, 2) and (0, 6). Mode 1 applies.
    *   Shift Triggers: Red (2) at (3, 9), (7, 9), (11, 9).
    *   Grid Midpoint: Column 10 / 2 = 5.0. All triggers are at column 9 (>= 5.0).
    *   Expected Behavior: Initial pattern {2, 6}. Row 3 trigger causes shift left to {1, 5} for row 3 onwards. Row 7 trigger causes shift left to {0, 4} for row 7 onwards. Row 11 trigger causes shift left to {-1, 3} -> {3} for row 11 onwards. Pattern only overwrites white (0).
    *   Code Failure: Incorrect shift timing and only implementing left shift. The code applied pattern {2, 6} to row 3 before shifting, and applied {1, 5} to row 7 before shifting, etc. The actual output shows these timing errors.

*   **Example 2 (Mode 1 - Trigger Left):**
    *   Input Size: 17x12
    *   Mode Trigger: Azure (8) at (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9). Mode 1 applies.
    *   Shift Triggers: Red (2) at (4, 0), (10, 0).
    *   Grid Midpoint: Column 12 / 2 = 6.0. All triggers are at column 0 (< 6.0).
    *   Expected Behavior: Initial pattern {1, 5, 7, 9}. Row 4 trigger causes shift right to {2, 6, 8, 10} for row 4 onwards. Row 10 trigger causes shift right to {3, 7, 9, 11} for row 10 onwards. Pattern only overwrites white (0).
    *   Code Failure: Incorrect shift timing and incorrect shift direction (code assumed left shift). The code applied the wrong pattern from row 4 onwards.

*   **Example 3 (Mode 2):**
    *   Input Size: 12x12
    *   Mode Trigger: No azure (8) in row 0. Azure (8) at (2, 0), (6, 0), (9, 0). Mode 2 applies.
    *   Expected Behavior: Copy input. Draw 4-pixel azure blocks triggered by column 0 azure pixels: [(2,0)-(2,3)], [(1,4)-(1,7)], [(0,8)-(0,11)]; [(6,0)-(6,3)], [(5,4)-(5,7)], [(4,8)-(4,11)]; [(9,0)-(9,3)], [(8,4)-(8,7)], [(7,8)-(7,11)]. These blocks overwrite existing pixels.
    *   Code Success: The code correctly implemented this logic.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an exact copy of the input grid.
2.  Examine the first row (row 0) of the input grid.
3.  **If the first row contains any azure (8) pixels:**
    a.  Determine the set of column indices containing azure pixels in the first row. This is the initial `current_pattern`.
    b.  Get the width `W` of the grid. Calculate the midpoint `M = W / 2`.
    c.  Iterate through each row `r` from 0 to the grid height minus 1.
    d.  Check if the input grid's row `r` contains any red (2) pixels.
    e.  If red pixels *are* present in input row `r`:
        i.  Find the smallest column index `c_trig` among all red pixels in that row.
        ii. If `c_trig < M`, update `current_pattern` by adding 1 to each column index it contains. Discard any resulting index that is greater than or equal to `W`.
        iii. If `c_trig >= M`, update `current_pattern` by subtracting 1 from each column index it contains. Discard any resulting index that is less than 0.
    f.  Apply the `current_pattern` (which may have just been updated in step 3.e) to the current row `r` of the *output* grid: For each column index `c` present in the `current_pattern`, check the corresponding *input* pixel `input[r, c]`. If `input[r, c]` is white (0), then set the *output* pixel `output[r, c]` to azure (8). (Do not modify `output[r, c]` if `input[r, c]` was not white).
    g.  Proceed to the next row (`r+1`) using the (potentially updated) `current_pattern`.
4.  **Else (if the first row contains no azure (8) pixels):**
    a.  Check if the first column (column 0) of the input grid contains any azure (8) pixels.
    b.  **If the first column contains azure (8) pixels:**
        i.  Find all row indices `r_trig` such that `input[r_trig, 0]` is azure (8).
        ii. For each such `r_trig`:
            -   Draw 4 azure pixels horizontally in the output grid starting at `(r_trig, 0)` (i.e., at columns 0, 1, 2, 3), overwriting previous content. Check column bounds.
            -   If `r_trig - 1` is a valid row index (>= 0), draw 4 azure pixels horizontally starting at `(r_trig - 1, 4)` (i.e., at columns 4, 5, 6, 7), overwriting previous content. Check column bounds.
            -   If `r_trig - 2` is a valid row index (>= 0), draw 4 azure pixels horizontally starting at `(r_trig - 2, 8)` (i.e., at columns 8, 9, 10, 11), overwriting previous content. Check column bounds.
    c.  **Else (if the first column also contains no azure (8) pixels):**
        i.  No transformation is needed; the output grid remains the initial copy of the input grid.
5.  Return the final output grid.
