Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Grid Size:** Both input and output grids are 16x16.
2.  **Background:** The dominant color in both examples is azure (8), acting as the background.
3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there is a single, contiguous object composed of non-azure colors located in the lower-left quadrant.
    *   Example 1: The object is made of gray (5) and white (0).
    *   Example 2: The object is made of blue (1) and red (2).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the movement (translation) of the non-background object horizontally to the right. The object's shape and colors remain identical. The background remains unchanged, filling the space vacated by the object.
5.  **Shift Amount:** The distance the object moves seems to vary between examples.
    *   Example 1: The object shifts 3 columns to the right. (e.g., leftmost point moves from column 2 to column 5).
    *   Example 2: The object shifts 5 columns to the right. (e.g., leftmost point moves from column 1 to column 6).
6.  **Determining the Shift:** The shift amount doesn't seem directly related to the object's size, width, height, or total number of pixels. However, the colors composing the object differ between the examples where the shift amount differs. Let's examine the top-leftmost pixel *of the object itself* (not necessarily the bounding box corner).
    *   Example 1: The object's pixel with the minimum row index (row 4) and then the minimum column index (col 4) is white (0). The shift is 3.
    *   Example 2: The object's pixel with the minimum row index (row 4) and then the minimum column index (col 2) is blue (1). The shift is 5.
7.  **Hypothesis:** The amount of the horizontal shift is determined by the color of the top-leftmost pixel belonging to the non-background object. The mapping observed is: White (0) -> Shift 3; Blue (1) -> Shift 5.

**Facts**


```yaml
task_context:
  grid_size: constant (16x16 in examples)
  background_color: azure (8), determined as the most frequent color.
objects:
  - id: source_object
    description: A single contiguous shape composed of non-background colors found in the input grid.
    properties:
      colors: A set of colors present in the object (e.g., {gray, white} or {blue, red}).
      pixels: List of coordinates (row, col) occupied by the object.
      anchor_pixel: The pixel within the object having the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index.
      anchor_color: The color of the anchor_pixel.
actions:
  - name: identify_background
    input: input_grid
    output: background_color
  - name: identify_object
    input: input_grid, background_color
    output: source_object (pixels, colors)
  - name: find_anchor_pixel
    input: source_object.pixels
    output: anchor_pixel (coordinate), anchor_color
  - name: determine_shift
    input: anchor_color
    output: horizontal_shift (integer dx)
    logic: Based on observed examples: if anchor_color is white(0), dx=3; if anchor_color is blue(1), dx=5.
  - name: translate_object
    input: input_grid, source_object.pixels, background_color, horizontal_shift (dx)
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a new grid filled with background_color. For each pixel (r, c) belonging to the source_object in the input, copy its color to the output grid at position (r, c + dx).
relationships:
  - The horizontal_shift amount depends solely on the anchor_color of the source_object.
  - The output grid is formed by translating the source_object from the input grid by the calculated horizontal_shift, leaving the background color in the original object location.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify the background color by finding the most frequent color in the input grid (assumed to be azure, 8).
2.  Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color. These pixels constitute the 'source object'.
3.  Find the 'anchor pixel' of the source object: identify the minimum row index occupied by any object pixel, and then among those pixels at the minimum row, find the one with the minimum column index. Record the color of this anchor pixel ('anchor_color').
4.  Determine the horizontal shift distance (`dx`) based on the `anchor_color`:
    *   If `anchor_color` is white (0), set `dx` to 3.
    *   If `anchor_color` is blue (1), set `dx` to 5.
    *   (This mapping may need generalization if more examples are provided).
5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color.
6.  For each pixel belonging to the source object at coordinate (row, col) in the input grid, copy its color to the coordinate (row, col + `dx`) in the output grid.
7.  The final output grid is the result of this translation.
