task_context:
  grid_size: constant (16x16 in examples)
  background_color: azure (8), determined as the most frequent color.
objects:
  - id: source_object
    description: A single contiguous shape composed of non-background colors found in the input grid.
    properties:
      colors: A set of colors present in the object (e.g., {gray, white} or {blue, red}).
      pixels: List of coordinates (row, col) occupied by the object.
      anchor_pixel: The pixel within the object having the minimum row index, and among those, the minimum column index.
      anchor_color: The color of the anchor_pixel.
actions:
  - name: identify_background
    input: input_grid
    output: background_color
  - name: identify_object
    input: input_grid, background_color
    output: source_object (pixels, colors)
  - name: find_anchor_pixel
    input: source_object.pixels
    output: anchor_pixel (coordinate), anchor_color
  - name: determine_shift
    input: anchor_color
    output: horizontal_shift (integer dx)
    logic: Based on observed examples: if anchor_color is white(0), dx=3; if anchor_color is blue(1), dx=5.
  - name: translate_object
    input: input_grid, source_object.pixels, background_color, horizontal_shift (dx)
    output: output_grid
    logic: Create a new grid filled with background_color. For each pixel (r, c) belonging to the source_object in the input, copy its color to the output grid at position (r, c + dx).
relationships:
  - The horizontal_shift amount depends solely on the anchor_color of the source_object.
  - The output grid is formed by translating the source_object from the input grid by the calculated horizontal_shift, leaving the background color in the original object location.
