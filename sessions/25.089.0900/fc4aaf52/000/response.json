The object's shape and colors remain identical. The background remains unchanged, filling the space vacated by the object.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** The distance the object moves seems to vary between examples.\n    *   Example 1: The object shifts 3 columns to the right. (e.g., leftmost point moves from column 2 to column 5).\n    *   Example 2: The object shifts 5 columns to the right. (e.g., leftmost point moves from column 1 to column 6).\n6.  **Determining the Shift:** The shift amount doesn't seem directly related to the object's size, width, height, or total number of pixels. However, the colors composing the object differ between the examples where the shift amount differs. Let's examine the top-leftmost pixel *of the object itself* (not necessarily the bounding box corner).\n    *   Example 1: The object's pixel with the minimum row index (row 4) and then the minimum column index (col 4) is white (0). The shift is 3.\n    *   Example 2: The object's pixel with the minimum row index (row 4) and then the minimum column index (col 2) is blue (1). The shift is 5.\n7.  **Hypothesis:** The amount of the horizontal shift is determined by the color of the top-leftmost pixel belonging to the non-background object. The mapping observed is: White (0) -> Shift 3; Blue (1) -> Shift 5.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not the background color. These pixels constitute the 'source object'.\n3.  Find the 'anchor pixel' of the source object: identify the minimum row index occupied by any object pixel, and then among those pixels at the minimum row, find the one with the minimum column index. Record the color of this anchor pixel ('anchor_color').\n4.  Determine the horizontal shift distance (`dx`) based on the `anchor_color`:\n    *   If `anchor_color` is white (0), set `dx` to 3.\n    *   If `anchor_color` is blue (1), set `dx` to 5.\n    *   (This mapping may need generalization if more examples are provided).\n5.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled entirely with the background color.\n6.  For each pixel belonging to the source object at coordinate (row, col) in the input grid, copy its color to the coordinate (row, col + `dx`) in the output grid.\n7.  The final output grid is the result of this translation."
