Input Grid:
  - Contains a background color: white (0).
  - Contains foreground objects: solid rectangles made of blue pixels (1).
  - Multiple objects can exist in one grid.

Output Grid:
  - Background color remains white (0).
  - The original blue rectangles are modified internally.
  - The pixels' colors within the original blue rectangular areas depend on their position relative to the edge of that rectangle.

Transformation Rule:
  - Identify each contiguous blue rectangle.
  - For each pixel that was originally blue:
    - Calculate the minimum distance (number of horizontal/vertical steps) from this pixel to the nearest edge of its containing blue rectangle. An edge is defined as a blue pixel adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a non-blue pixel or the grid boundary.
    - Assign a new color based on this minimum distance `d`:
      - If `d == 0` (pixel is on the edge): color remains 1 (blue).
      - If `d == 1`: color becomes 2 (red).
      - If `d >= 2`:
        - If `d` is even: color becomes 3 (green).
        - If `d` is odd: color becomes 2 (red).
  - Pixels originally white (0) remain white (0).
