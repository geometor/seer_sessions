The transformation modifies the colors *inside* these blue rectangles based on the pixel's distance from the rectangle's edge. The background remains unchanged. The edge pixels of the original blue rectangle remain blue (1) in the output. Pixels one step inside the edge become red (2). Pixels two steps inside become green (3). Pixels three steps inside become red (2) again, suggesting a repeating pattern (red, green, red, green...) for increasing distances from the edge, starting with red at distance 1.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"

An edge is defined as a blue pixel adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a non-blue pixel or the grid boundary.\n    - Assign a new color based on this minimum distance `d`:\n      - If `d == 0` (pixel is on the edge): color remains 1 (blue).\n      - If `d == 1`: color becomes 2 (red).\n      - If `d >= 2`:\n        - If `d` is even: color becomes 3 (green).\n        - If `d` is odd: color becomes 2 (red).\n  - Pixels originally white (0) remain white (0).\n```"
