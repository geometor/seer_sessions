**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The task operates on 2D grids of colored pixels. The size varies between examples.
2.  **Input Features:** Inputs contain sparsely distributed non-white pixels (colors 1 through 9) on a white background (color 0). Some inputs feature single pixels, while others have horizontal pairs or short segments of identical colors. The distribution and colors of pixels, especially in the last row, seem significant.
3.  **Output Features:** Outputs are generally transformations of the input grids. Two distinct transformation patterns emerge:
    *   **Horizontal Line Filling (Example 1):** Existing horizontal segments or pairs of points in a row are extended or filled to form longer horizontal lines. The color and extent of the filled line depend on the original pixels in that row and potentially the overall grid content.
    *   **Vertical Line Drawing (Examples 2 & 3):** Vertical lines spanning the entire height of the grid are drawn. The position and color of these vertical lines are determined solely by the non-white pixels present in the *last row* of the input grid.
4.  **Key Distinction:** The structure of the *last row* appears to determine which transformation type is applied. Specifically, the presence (Example 1) or absence (Examples 2 & 3) of adjacent, identical, non-white pixels in the last row seems to be the trigger.
5.  **Anomaly:** In Example 1, row 1's transformation (adding a single blue pixel at column 6) doesn't perfectly fit the derived horizontal filling rule that applies to other rows in that example.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 2
  cell_values: integers 0-9 (colors)
  background_color: 0 (white)
  size_variable: true

input_features:
  - objects: individual non-white pixels
  - objects: horizontal pairs/segments of identical non-white pixels
  - property: position (row, column) of pixels
  - property: color of pixels
  - critical_feature: content and structure of the last row (presence/absence of adjacent identical non-white pixels)
  - critical_feature: position and color of all non-white pixels in the last row (for vertical mode)
  - critical_feature: position and color of leftmost and rightmost non-white pixels within each row (for horizontal mode)
  - critical_feature: set of unique colors within each row (for horizontal mode)
  - critical_feature: maximum column index containing any non-white pixel across the entire grid (for horizontal mode)

output_features:
  - transformation_mode_1: horizontal line filling/extension
    - based_on: pixels within each row, grid maximum column index
    - color_rule: depends on unique colors in the row (color of rightmost pixel)
    - extent_rule: depends on unique colors in the row (min/max columns in row or grid max column)
  - transformation_mode_2: vertical line drawing
    - based_on: pixels in the last row of the input
    - color_rule: color of the corresponding last-row pixel
    - extent_rule: full height of the grid at the column of the corresponding last-row pixel
  - preservation: original input pixels are generally preserved in the output, overlaid by new lines.

relationships:
  - conditional_logic: the transformation rule depends on the structure of the last row of the input grid.
  - pattern_mapping: specific patterns in rows (horizontal) or the last row (vertical) map to specific output structures (lines).

anomaly:
  - example: train_1, row 1
  - description: the transformation adds a single pixel (1,6,blue) which does not align perfectly with the generalized horizontal filling rule derived from other rows in the same example.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the last row of the input grid. Check if there are any adjacent, identical, non-white pixels (e.g., two blue pixels side-by-side).
2.  **If** adjacent identical non-white pixels exist in the last row (Mode 1 - Horizontal Fill):
    a.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Find the maximum column index (`grid_max_c`) occupied by any non-white pixel across the entire input grid.
    c.  Iterate through each row `r` of the input grid.
    d.  Identify all non-white pixels in row `r` and their column indices `cols`.
    e.  If the number of non-white pixels in row `r` is 2 or more:
        i.  Determine the minimum column index (`min_c`) and maximum column index (`max_c`) from `cols`.
        ii. Determine the set of unique colors (`unique_colors`) present among these non-white pixels in row `r`.
        iii. Get the color (`color_at_max_c`) of the pixel at `(r, max_c)`.
        iv. If there is more than one unique color (`len(unique_colors) > 1`): Fill the cells in the output grid from `(r, min_c)` to `(r, max_c)` (inclusive) with `color_at_max_c`.
        v. If there is only one unique color (`len(unique_colors) == 1`): Fill the cells in the output grid from `(r, min_c)` to `(r, grid_max_c)` (inclusive) with `color_at_max_c` (which is the single unique color).
    f.  *(Note: This rule may not perfectly explain row 1 of train_1)*.
3.  **Else** (no adjacent identical non-white pixels in the last row) (Mode 2 - Vertical Fill):
    a.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    b.  Identify the index of the last row (`r_last`).
    c.  Find all non-white pixels in the last row. For each such pixel found at column `c` with color `C`:
        i.  Draw a vertical line of color `C` in the output grid in column `c`, extending from the top row (row 0) to the bottom row (`r_last`).
4.  Return the final output grid.
