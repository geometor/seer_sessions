            "text": "*   **Refined Hypothesis:** The transformation identifies the non-background color that appears least frequently in the input grid. It then replaces all pixels of that specific color with the background color (white, 0). All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThis hypothesis holds for both examples.\n\n**Structuring the response:**\n\n1.  **Perception:** Describe the input/output grids, focusing on the colors present and how they change. Mention the key observation that only one specific color changes, and it changes to the background color.\n2.  **Facts (YAML):**\n    *   Identify grid properties (size varies).\n    *   Identify pixel colors as objects/elements.\n    *   Identify the background color (white, 0).\n    *   Note the presence of multiple non-background colors.\n    *   Focus on the action: changing one specific color to the background color.\n    *   State the relationship: the color being changed is the one with the minimum count among non-background colors.\n3.  **Natural Language Program:** Outline the steps:\n    1.  Identify all unique colors present in the input grid, excluding the background color (white, 0).\n    2.  Count the occurrences of each unique non-background color.\n    3.  Determine the non-background color with the minimum count. This is the \"target color\".\n    4.  Create the output grid by iterating through the input grid.\n    5.  If a pixel in the input grid has the \"target color\", set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to the background color (white, 0).\n    6.  Otherwise, copy the pixel's color from the input grid to the output grid.\n    7.  Return the modified grid.Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are grids of pixels with different colors. The grid dimensions remain the same between input and output for each example.\n2.  **Color Palette:** The primary colors involved are white (0) as the background, and various other colors like red (2), blue (1), green (3), and azure (8) forming objects or patterns.\n3.  **Transformation Observation:** The core transformation seems to involve identifying *one specific color* in the input grid (other than the background white) and replacing all instances of that color with the background color (white, 0). All other colors remain unchanged in their positions.\n4.  **Identifying the Target Color:**\n    *   In `train_1`, blue (1) pixels are present alongside red (2) pixels. In the output, only the blue pixels are replaced with white (0). The red pixels remain.\n    *   In `train_2`, azure (8) pixels are present alongside green (3) pixels. In the output, only the azure pixels are replaced with white (0). The green pixels remain.\n5.  **Pattern Recognition:** Comparing the counts of the non-background colors in each input, it appears that the color being replaced is the one that occurs *least frequently*.\n    *   In `train_1`, blue (1) occurs less often than red (2).\n    *   In `train_2`, azure (8) occurs less often than green (3).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
