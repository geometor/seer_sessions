  - type: separation
    description: "Red pixel pairs are separated only by Orange pixels."

actions:
  - action: find_pairs
    input: Red pixels (2)
    condition: "Located on the same row, separated horizontally only by Orange pixels (7)."
    output: Identified pairs and the range of Orange pixels between them.
  - action: fill_space
    input: Range of Orange pixels (7) between an identified Red pair.
    output: Change the color of these pixels to Maroon (9).
  - action: remove_existing
    input: Maroon pixels (9) from the original input grid.
    output: Change the color of these pixels to Orange (7).

input_output_comparison:
  - property: grid_size
    value: "Remains unchanged."
  - property: background_color
    value: "Remains unchanged (Orange, 7)."
  - property: red_pixels (2)
    value: "Remain unchanged in their positions."
  - property: original_maroon_pixels (9)
    value: "Are changed to the background color (Orange, 7)."
  - property: orange_pixels (7)
    value: "Some Orange pixels located horizontally between pairs of Red pixels are changed to Maroon (9)."
  - property: new_maroon_pixels (9)
    value: "Appear only in the horizontal spaces between specific pairs of Red pixels."

sequence:
  - step: 1
    action: "Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid."
  - step: 2
    action: "Iterate through the output grid. Change any existing Maroon (9) pixels to the background color (Orange, 7)."
  - step: 3
    action: "Iterate through each row of the grid (after step 2)."
  - step: 4
    action: "Within each row, identify all pairs of Red (2) pixels."
  - step: 5
    action: "For each identified pair, verify that all pixels horizontally between them are the background color (Orange, 7)."
  - step: 6
    action: "If the condition in step 5 is met, change the color of all the background pixels between the Red pair to Maroon (9) in the output grid."
