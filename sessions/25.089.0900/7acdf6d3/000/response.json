            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Background Color:** Both input and output grids primarily use Orange (7) as the background color.\n2.  **Key Colors:** The transformation involves Red (2), Maroon (9), and Orange (7) pixels.\n3.  **Input Features:** The inputs contain scattered Red (2) pixels and sometimes Maroon (9) pixels. A noticeable pattern in both inputs is the presence of pairs of Red pixels located on the same row, separated horizontally by one or more Orange pixels.\n4.  **Output Features:** In the outputs, the original Maroon (9) pixels from the input are removed (replaced by the Orange background). New Maroon (9) pixels are introduced. These new Maroon pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of Red pixels that were present in the input, specifically those pairs horizontally aligned on the same row and separated only by Orange pixels.\n5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to be identifying horizontally aligned pairs of Red pixels separated only by the background color (Orange). The space between these Red pixels is then 'filled' with Maroon pixels. Simultaneously, any Maroon pixels originally present in the input are erased (turned into the background color). The Red pixels themselves remain unchanged.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
