Okay, let's analyze the transformation based on the provided examples.

**Perception:**

1.  **Background Color:** Both input and output grids primarily use Orange (7) as the background color.
2.  **Key Colors:** The transformation involves Red (2), Maroon (9), and Orange (7) pixels.
3.  **Input Features:** The inputs contain scattered Red (2) pixels and sometimes Maroon (9) pixels. A noticeable pattern in both inputs is the presence of pairs of Red pixels located on the same row, separated horizontally by one or more Orange pixels.
4.  **Output Features:** In the outputs, the original Maroon (9) pixels from the input are removed (replaced by the Orange background). New Maroon (9) pixels are introduced. These new Maroon pixels appear exclusively *between* pairs of Red pixels that were present in the input, specifically those pairs horizontally aligned on the same row and separated only by Orange pixels.
5.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation seems to be identifying horizontally aligned pairs of Red pixels separated only by the background color (Orange). The space between these Red pixels is then 'filled' with Maroon pixels. Simultaneously, any Maroon pixels originally present in the input are erased (turned into the background color). The Red pixels themselves remain unchanged.

**Facts:**


```yaml

  description: "Fill the horizontal space between pairs of red pixels with maroon pixels, and remove any original maroon pixels."
  background_color: 7 # Orange
  relevant_colors:
    - 2 # Red
    - 7 # Orange
    - 9 # Maroon

    role: "Filler / To be removed"
  - type: pixel
    color: 7 # Orange

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_adjacency
    description: "Pairs of Red pixels on the same row."
  - type: separation
    description: "Red pixel pairs are separated only by Orange pixels."

actions:
  - action: find_pairs
    input: Red pixels (2)
    condition: "Located on the same row, separated horizontally only by Orange pixels (7)."
    output: Identified pairs and the range of Orange pixels between them.
  - action: fill_space
    input: Range of Orange pixels (7) between an identified Red pair.
    output: Change the color of these pixels to Maroon (9).
  - action: remove_existing
    input: Maroon pixels (9) from the original input grid.
    output: Change the color of these pixels to Orange (7).

input_output_comparison:
  - property: grid_size
    value: "Remains unchanged."
  - property: background_color
    value: "Remains unchanged (Orange, 7)."
  - property: red_pixels (2)
    value: "Remain unchanged in their positions."
  - property: original_maroon_pixels (9)
    value: "Are changed to the background color (Orange, 7)."
  - property: orange_pixels (7)
    value: "Some Orange pixels located horizontally between pairs of Red pixels are changed to Maroon (9)."
  - property: new_maroon_pixels (9)
    value: "Appear only in the horizontal spaces between specific pairs of Red pixels."

sequence:
  - step: 1
    action: "Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid."
  - step: 2
    action: "Iterate through the output grid. Change any existing Maroon (9) pixels to the background color (Orange, 7)."
  - step: 3
    action: "Iterate through each row of the grid (after step 2)."
  - step: 4
    action: "Within each row, identify all pairs of Red (2) pixels."
  - step: 5
    action: "For each identified pair, verify that all pixels horizontally between them are the background color (Orange, 7)."
  - step: 6
    action: "If the condition in step 5 is met, change the color of all the background pixels between the Red pair to Maroon (9) in the output grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input grid.
2.  First, find all pixels that are initially Maroon (9) and change them to the background color (Orange, 7).
3.  Then, examine each row of the grid independently.
4.  In a given row, find all pairs of Red (2) pixels.
5.  For each pair of Red pixels found in that row, check if all the pixels located strictly *between* them horizontally are Orange (7).
6.  If this condition is true (only Orange pixels are between the Red pair in that row), then change the color of all these intervening Orange pixels to Maroon (9).
7.  Leave all other pixels (including the Red pixels forming the pairs) unchanged from their state after step 2.
8.  The resulting grid is the output.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Remove any pre-existing Maroon (9) pixels by changing them to the background color (Orange, 7).
3. Iterate through each row of the grid.
4. In each row, identify all pairs of Red (2) pixels.
5. For each pair of Red pixels (at columns left_col and right_col, where left_col < right_col), check if all pixels strictly between them (from column left_col + 1 to right_col - 1) are the background color (Orange, 7).
6. If the condition is met (only Orange pixels between the pair), change the color of these intervening Orange pixels to Maroon (9) in the output grid.
7. Leave all other pixels, including the Red pixels forming the pairs, unchanged.
