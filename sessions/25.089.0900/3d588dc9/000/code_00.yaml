relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Focus on the relative positions (rows, columns, distance) between the gray object and various white objects.
  - type: selection_criteria
    condition: Select the white object that shares at least one row with the gray object AND has the minimum horizontal distance (gap) to the gray object.
  - type: modification_location
    condition: The column to modify within the selected white object is the one immediately adjacent (horizontally) to the gray object's bounding box, or closest if there's a gap.

    action: Change the color of pixels in the specified column of the selected white object to magenta (6).

transformation_summary:
   Find the gray object and all white objects. Select the white object that shares rows with the gray object and is horizontally closest. Change the column of this white object that is nearest to the gray object to magenta.
