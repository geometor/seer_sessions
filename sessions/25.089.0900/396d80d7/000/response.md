Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception**

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both examples show 16x16 grids. The input grids have a background color (orange, 7) and a central pattern composed of two other colors. The output grids retain the original pattern but add pixels of one of the pattern's colors to the background surrounding the pattern.
2.  **Colors:**
    *   Example 1 uses orange (7) background, magenta (6) as the main pattern shape color, and red (2) as a secondary pattern color and the color added in the output.
    *   Example 2 uses orange (7) background, yellow (4) as the main pattern shape color, and blue (1) as a secondary pattern color and the color added in the output.
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying specific locations in the background (orange pixels) adjacent (including diagonals) to the main pattern shape and changing their color. The color they change *to* is the *other* color present in the original pattern (the secondary color).
4.  **Rule:** The condition for changing an orange pixel seems to depend on the number of adjacent neighbors (including diagonals) that have the main pattern color (magenta in Ex1, yellow in Ex2).
    *   In Example 1, orange pixels change to red (2) if they have 1, 2, or 3 magenta (6) neighbors.
    *   In Example 2, orange pixels change to blue (1) if they have exactly 1 yellow (4) neighbor.
5.  **Identifying Colors:**
    *   The background color (7) is the most frequent color.
    *   The two pattern colors can be distinguished: one forms the larger structural part of the pattern (`PatternColor`: 6 in Ex1, 4 in Ex2), and the other is either central or less numerous (`CenterColor`: 2 in Ex1, 1 in Ex2). The `CenterColor` is also the color added to the output.
6.  **Rule Generalization:** The number of `PatternColor` neighbors required to trigger the change seems to depend on the specific `CenterColor`. If the `CenterColor` is Red (2), the count is {1, 2, 3}. If the `CenterColor` is Blue (1), the count is {1}.
