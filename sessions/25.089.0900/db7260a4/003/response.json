Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2.  Locate the single blue (1) pixel (the trigger) in the input grid. Note its coordinates (row, column).\n3.  Change the trigger pixel's location in the output grid to white (0).\n4.  Locate all red (2) pixels (the boundary structure) in the input grid.\n5.  If no red pixels exist, change all pixels in the bottom row of the output grid to blue (1) and return.\n6.  Determine the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the red pixels (the horizontal span).\n7.  Check if the trigger pixel's column index falls within the horizontal span (inclusive).\n8.  Find all connected components of white (0) pixels in the current state of the output grid (using 4-directional adjacency).\n9.  Identify which of these white components, if any, do *not* contain any pixels located on the grid boundary (row 0, last row, column 0, last column). These are the \"non-boundary\" components.\n10. Apply the fill rule:\n    *   If the trigger pixel's column was *within* the horizontal span *and* there is at least one non-boundary white component:\n        *   Select the largest non-boundary component (the one with the most pixels).\n        *   Change the color of all pixels within this selected component to blue (1) in the output grid.\n    *   Else (either the trigger pixel's column was *outside* the span, or it was *inside* but there were *no* non-boundary white components):\n        *   Change the color of all pixels in the bottom row (last row) of the output grid to blue (1).\n11. Output the final modified grid.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds coordinates of all pixels of a specific color.\"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    # Convert to list of tuples for easier handling, especially with sets\n    return [tuple(coord) for coord in coords]\n\ndef find_connected_components(grid, color, connectivity=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all connected components of a given color in the grid.\n    Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    components = []\n    \n    # Define neighbor directions based on connectivity\n    if connectivity == 4:\n        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n    elif connectivity == 8:\n        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Connectivity must be 4 or 8\")\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            coord = (r, c)\n            if grid[r, c] == color and coord not in visited:\n                # Start BFS for a new component\n                component = set()\n                q = deque([coord])\n                visited.add(coord)\n                component.add(coord)\n\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    for dr, dc in directions:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        neighbor_coord = (nr, nc)\n                        # Check bounds and color and if not visited\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == color and \\\n                           neighbor_coord not in visited:\n                            visited.add(neighbor_coord)\n                            component.add(neighbor_coord)\n                            q.append(neighbor_coord)\n                \n                if component:\n                    components.append(component)\n    return components\n\ndef check_boundary_touch(component, grid_shape):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if any pixel in the component touches the grid boundary.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid_shape\n    max_row = rows - 1\n    max_col = cols - 1\n    for r, c in component:\n        if r == 0 or r == max_row or c == 0 or c == max_col:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the described logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
