The original blue pixel is always changed to white (0). Some white pixels in the input are changed to blue (1) in the output. The red structure remains unchanged.\n3.  **Key Objects:**\n    *   The single blue pixel (trigger object).\n    *   The red structure (boundary/shape object).\n    *   White pixels (background/fillable areas).\n4.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves a conditional fill operation. The location of the input blue pixel relative to the horizontal extent of the red structure determines the fill rule.\n5.  **Fill Rule 1 (Blue Trigger Inside Red Span):** If the column index of the blue trigger pixel falls within the minimum and maximum column indices occupied by the red structure, the transformation identifies white regions enclosed by the red structure and the grid boundaries. The largest such enclosed region is then filled with blue. If no region is enclosed (e.g., the red structure has gaps allowing white pixels to 'escape' to the boundary), this rule might transition to Rule 2. Example train_3 demonstrates this transition where the broken 'U' has no enclosed region, leading to the bottom row fill.\n6.  **Fill Rule 2 (Blue Trigger Outside Red Span / No Enclosed Region):** If the column index of the blue trigger pixel is outside the horizontal span of the red structure, OR if Rule 1 applies but finds no fully enclosed white region, the transformation fills the entire bottom row of the grid with blue.\n7.  **Invariant:** The red structure's position and shape remain identical between input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
