task_description: Conditional fill based on a trigger pixel and a boundary structure.

elements:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    role: Fillable area, default state.
  - id: trigger_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    count: 1
    role: Determines the fill condition based on its horizontal position relative to the boundary structure. Disappears in the output.
  - id: boundary_structure
    color: red (2)
    role: Defines boundaries for potential fill areas and determines the horizontal span for the trigger condition. Remains unchanged.
  - id: fill_pixels
    color: blue (1)
    role: Appear in the output, replacing specific white pixels according to the transformation rule.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    from: trigger_pixel
    to: boundary_structure
    detail: The column index of the trigger_pixel is compared to the minimum and maximum column indices of the boundary_structure.
  - type: enclosure
    element: boundary_structure
    target: background (white pixels)
    detail: The boundary_structure, potentially along with grid edges, may enclose regions of white pixels. An enclosed region is one where white pixels cannot reach the grid boundary via adjacent (non-diagonal) white pixels without crossing the boundary_structure.
  - type: boundary
    element: grid_edges
    role: Act as implicit boundaries for enclosure.

actions:
  - name: check_trigger_position
    input: trigger_pixel, boundary_structure
    output: boolean (is trigger column within boundary horizontal span?)
  - name: find_enclosed_regions
    input: grid, boundary_structure
    output: list of enclosed white regions (sets of coordinates)
  - name: fill_region
    target: largest enclosed white region
    color: blue (1)
    condition: Trigger position is within span AND enclosed region exists.
  - name: fill_bottom_row
    target: bottom row of the grid
    color: blue (1)
    condition: Trigger position is outside span OR no enclosed region exists.
  - name: remove_trigger
    target: trigger_pixel
    action: change color to white (0)
    condition: always performed.
