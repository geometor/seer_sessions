**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components (trigger, boundary, background) and the two primary outcomes (fill enclosed area, fill bottom row). The provided code attempted to implement this logic using connected components analysis. However, the results show that the code failed on examples where an enclosed area *should* have been filled (Examples 1, 4, 5), defaulting instead to filling the bottom row. Examples 2 (trigger outside span) and 3 (trigger inside span, but no enclosed area) were handled correctly, indicating the "fill bottom row" logic branch is likely functional, but the condition leading to filling the enclosed area is either incorrect or failing to detect the enclosed area properly.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the conditions under which each fill type occurs across all examples.
2.  Use code execution (`tool_code`) to simulate the crucial step of identifying connected white components and checking if they touch the boundary, specifically for the failed examples, to confirm the expected intermediate state.
3.  Refine the YAML description and the Natural Language Program to precisely match the observed behavior across all examples, focusing on the definition of an "enclosed" or "non-boundary" region and the exact conditions triggering each fill type.
