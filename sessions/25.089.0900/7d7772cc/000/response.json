            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair (`train_1`).\n\n**Perception:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grid (16x16) appears divided into two main horizontal sections by a row of white pixels (row 7). The top section (rows 0-6) and bottom section (rows 8-15) predominantly use maroon (9) as a background color. The bottom section also has a white border.\n2.  **Key Feature:** Row 3 in the input grid contains several non-maroon pixels (gray-5, green-3, red-2) interspersed with maroon pixels. Row 8 in the input seems similar but is part of the distinct bottom section and doesn't change in the output.\n3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between the input and output grids occur *only* within the top section (rows 0-6). The separator row (row 7) and the entire bottom section (rows 8-15) remain identical.\n4.  **Pixel Movement:** The non-maroon pixels originally in row 3 of the input are moved to new locations in the output grid, specifically to row 0 or row 6, while maintaining their original column index.\n5.  **Movement Rule:** Observing the moved pixels:\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 1)` (gray-5) moves to output `(6, 1)`. Note: `1 % 8 == 1`.\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 3)` (green-3) moves to output `(0, 3)`. Note: `3 % 8 != 1`.\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 5)` (gray-5) moves to output `(0, 5)`. Note: `5 % 8 != 1`.\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 7)` (red-2) moves to output `(0, 7)`. Note: `7 % 8 != 1`.\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 9)` (green-3) moves to output `(6, 9)`. Note: `9 % 8 == 1`.\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 11)` (red-2) moves to output `(0, 11)`. Note: `11 % 8 != 1`.\n    *   Pixel at input `(3, 13)` (gray-5) moves to output `(0, 13)`. Note: `13 % 8 != 1`.\n    The pattern suggests that the destination row depends on the original column index (`c`) modulo 8. If `c % 8 == 1`, the pixel moves to row 6; otherwise, it moves to row 0.\n6.  **Overwriting:** The original positions of the moved pixels in row 3 are replaced with the maroon (9) background color in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
