Okay, let's analyze the provided example pair (`train_1`).

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grid (16x16) appears divided into two main horizontal sections by a row of white pixels (row 7). The top section (rows 0-6) and bottom section (rows 8-15) predominantly use maroon (9) as a background color. The bottom section also has a white border.
2.  **Key Feature:** Row 3 in the input grid contains several non-maroon pixels (gray-5, green-3, red-2) interspersed with maroon pixels. Row 8 in the input seems similar but is part of the distinct bottom section and doesn't change in the output.
3.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes between the input and output grids occur *only* within the top section (rows 0-6). The separator row (row 7) and the entire bottom section (rows 8-15) remain identical.
4.  **Pixel Movement:** The non-maroon pixels originally in row 3 of the input are moved to new locations in the output grid, specifically to row 0 or row 6, while maintaining their original column index.
5.  **Movement Rule:** Observing the moved pixels:
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 1)` (gray-5) moves to output `(6, 1)`. Note: `1 % 8 == 1`.
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 3)` (green-3) moves to output `(0, 3)`. Note: `3 % 8 != 1`.
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 5)` (gray-5) moves to output `(0, 5)`. Note: `5 % 8 != 1`.
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 7)` (red-2) moves to output `(0, 7)`. Note: `7 % 8 != 1`.
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 9)` (green-3) moves to output `(6, 9)`. Note: `9 % 8 == 1`.
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 11)` (red-2) moves to output `(0, 11)`. Note: `11 % 8 != 1`.
    *   Pixel at input `(3, 13)` (gray-5) moves to output `(0, 13)`. Note: `13 % 8 != 1`.
    The pattern suggests that the destination row depends on the original column index (`c`) modulo 8. If `c % 8 == 1`, the pixel moves to row 6; otherwise, it moves to row 0.
6.  **Overwriting:** The original positions of the moved pixels in row 3 are replaced with the maroon (9) background color in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml

significant_row: 3 # Row containing pixels to be moved in the input

  description: Non-maroon pixels located in row 3 of the input grid.
  locations:
    - [3, 1]
    - [3, 3]
    - [3, 5]
    - [3, 7]
    - [3, 9]
    - [3, 11]
    - [3, 13]

  - 0
  - 6
unchanged_regions:
  - row: 7 # White separator row
  - rows: [8, 15] # Entire bottom section
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pixels in input row 3
    condition: color is not 9 (maroon)
  - action: determine_destination
    based_on: original column index `c`
    rule:
      if: c % 8 == 1
      then: destination row is 6
      else: destination row is 0
    result: destination coordinates (destination_row, c)
  - action: move
    source: pixel at input (3, c)
    destination: output (destination_row, c)
    effect: copies pixel color to destination
  - action: overwrite
    target: original pixel location in output grid (3, c)
    color: 9 (maroon)
  - action: copy
    target: all other pixels not involved in the move/overwrite process
    source: input grid
    destination: output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each column index `c` of the input grid.
3.  Check the pixel at row 3, column `c` in the input grid. Let its color be `v`.
4.  If the color `v` is not maroon (9):
    a.  Determine the destination row: If the column index `c` modulo 8 is equal to 1, the destination row (`dest_r`) is 6. Otherwise, the destination row (`dest_r`) is 0.
    b.  Set the pixel in the output grid at location (`dest_r`, `c`) to the color `v`.
    c.  Set the pixel in the output grid at the original location (3, `c`) to maroon (9).
5.  All other pixels retain their original values from the input grid (as handled by the initial copy).
6.  Return the modified output grid.
