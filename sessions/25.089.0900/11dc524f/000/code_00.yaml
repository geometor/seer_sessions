    movement_rule: >
      Move one step at a time along the axis (horizontal or vertical)
      corresponding to the largest absolute distance component between the
      objects' bounding boxes (or centroids). The direction is towards the target object.
    stopping_condition: >
      Stop when any pixel of the mobile_object is adjacent (including diagonals,
      i.e., max(abs(dr), abs(dc)) == 1) to any pixel of the target_object.
