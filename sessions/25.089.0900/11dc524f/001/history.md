Okay, let's break down the task.

**Perception:**

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x13 in all examples).
2.  **Colors:** The grids primarily use orange (7) as a background color. There are two other colors present: red (2) and gray (5).
3.  **Objects:** In each input grid, there are two distinct objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same color, set against the orange background:
    *   One object is entirely red (2). Its shape varies across examples (L-shape, T-shape, backward L-shape).
    *   One object is entirely gray (5). Its shape also varies (2x2 square in all examples shown, though the rule might apply generally).
4.  **Transformation:** Comparing input and output grids reveals a change in the position of the red object. The gray object appears to remain stationary in all examples. The orange background remains unchanged.
5.  **Movement Pattern:** The red object moves from its initial position to a final position where it is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the gray object. The movement seems directed *towards* the gray object.
6.  **Movement Mechanics:** The movement appears to happen iteratively along a primary axis (horizontal or vertical).
    *   In `train_1`, the red object moves vertically upwards (+2 rows) until it's diagonally adjacent to the gray object. The primary separation is vertical.
    *   In `train_2`, the red object moves downwards (+2 rows) until it's vertically adjacent to the gray object. The primary separation is vertical.
    *   In `train_3`, the red object moves upwards (-2 rows) until it's vertically adjacent to the gray object. The primary separation is vertical.
    *   It seems the red object takes steps along the axis (horizontal or vertical) where the separation between the objects (measured e.g., by bounding box distance) is greatest. It moves one step at a time along this axis until adjacency is achieved.
7.  **Adjacency:** The movement stops precisely when at least one pixel of the red object occupies a cell that is a direct neighbor (including diagonals) of a cell occupied by a gray pixel.
8.  **Object Integrity:** The shape and color of the red object are preserved during the movement. The gray object and the background remain completely static.

    movement_rule: >
      Move one step at a time along the axis (horizontal or vertical)
      corresponding to the largest absolute distance component between the
      objects' bounding boxes (or centroids). The direction is towards the target object.
    stopping_condition: >
      Stop when any pixel of the mobile_object is adjacent (including diagonals,
      i.e., max(abs(dr), abs(dc)) == 1) to any pixel of the target_object.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the grid background color (orange, 7).
2.  Locate all contiguous pixels forming the red object (color 2) and record their coordinates.
3.  Locate all contiguous pixels forming the gray object (color 5) and record their coordinates.
4.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
5.  Start an iterative process:
    a.  Check if any red pixel is currently adjacent (including diagonals) to any gray pixel. If yes, the process is complete; return the current state of the output grid.
    b.  Determine the primary direction of movement:
        i.  Calculate the overall vector separating the red object from the gray object (e.g., vector between centroids or bounding box centers/corners).
        ii. Determine the axis (horizontal 'x' or vertical 'y') with the largest absolute component in the separation vector.
        iii. Define a single step vector (dx, dy) based on this axis: if the y-component is larger, step is (0, sign(dy)); if the x-component is larger, step is (sign(dx), 0). If equal, prioritize one (e.g., y-axis) or allow diagonal (sign(dx), sign(dy)) - based on examples, axial seems correct.
    c.  Update the output grid:
        i.  Remove the red object from its current position (set pixels to background color).
        ii. Calculate the new coordinates for each red pixel by adding the step vector (dx, dy) to its current coordinates.
        iii. Place the red object at its new coordinates in the output grid.
    d.  Repeat from step 5a.
