The input grids contain a background color and various scattered pixels of other colors. Critically, each input grid features at least one complete vertical line composed of a single, non-background color. This vertical line acts as a delimiter. The output grid corresponds to the portion of the input grid located to the left of the *first* such vertical delimiter line encountered when scanning from left to right. The height of the output grid is the same as the input grid, and its width is determined by the column index of the delimiter line.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Iterate through the columns of the input grid, starting from the leftmost column (index 0).\n3.  For each column, check if all pixels in that column have the same color and if that color is different from the background color.\n4.  Identify the index of the *first* column that satisfies these conditions (the delimiter column).\n5.
