task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - barrier_color: azure (8)
  - start_color: red (2)
  - grid_dimensions: variable (height and width)
objects:
  - object_type: start_point
    color: red (2)
    count: 1
    description: The single pixel from which the fill operation originates. Remains red in the output.
  - object_type: barriers
    color: azure (8)
    count: multiple
    description: Pixels that block the spread of the fill color. They remain unchanged in the output.
    shape: Can form lines, partial enclosures, or scattered points.
  - object_type: fill_area
    color: white (0)
    count: multiple
    description: Pixels representing empty space potentially reachable from the start_point without crossing barriers.
relationships:
  - relationship_type: boundary
    element1: fill_area (white pixels)
    element2: barriers (azure pixels)
    element3: grid_edges
    description: Azure pixels and grid edges define the boundaries for the fill operation.
  - relationship_type: adjacency
    description: The fill spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) between pixels.
transformation:
  type: flood_fill
  start_condition: Find the single red (2) pixel.
  fill_color: red (2)
  target_pixels: white (0) # Pixels to be filled
  barrier_pixels: azure (8) # Pixels that block filling
  persistence:
    - The original start_point (red pixel) remains red.
    - Barrier pixels (azure pixels) remain azure.
  action: Change the color of reachable target_pixels (white) to the fill_color (red).
output_features:
  - background_color: white (0) (remaining unfilled areas)
  - barrier_color: azure (8) (unchanged from input)
  - fill_color: red (2) (original start point + filled white pixels)
