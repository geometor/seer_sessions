## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input/Output Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of pixels with integer values representing colors.
2.  **Colors:** The significant colors are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). White represents the background or empty space. Azure seems to represent fixed barriers or walls. Red represents a starting point and the color used for filling.
3.  **Objects:**
    *   **Start Point:** Each input grid contains exactly one red pixel (2). This pixel serves as the starting point for the transformation.
    *   **Barriers:** Azure pixels (8) are present in the input grids, often forming lines or partial boundaries. These pixels remain unchanged in the output and act as barriers.
    *   **Fill Area:** The white pixels (0) represent areas that can potentially be filled.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a "flood fill" or "paint bucket" operation. Starting from the single red pixel, the red color spreads outwards into adjacent white pixels. The spread stops when it encounters an azure pixel or the edge of the grid.
5.  **Connectivity:** The fill spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels. Diagonal movement is not observed.
6.  **State Preservation:** The original red pixel and all azure pixels remain in their positions in the output grid. Only white pixels change color to red.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  Locate the coordinates (row, column) of the single pixel with the color red (2) in the input grid. This is the starting point.
3.  Initialize a queue or stack for flood fill processing, adding the starting point coordinates. Maintain a set of visited coordinates to avoid redundant processing, initially containing the starting point.
4.  While the processing queue/stack is not empty:
    a.  Dequeue/pop a coordinate (current\_row, current\_col).
    b.  For each cardinal neighbor (up, down, left, right) of the current coordinate:
        i.  Calculate the neighbor's coordinates (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col).
        ii. Check if the neighbor coordinate is within the grid boundaries.
        iii. Check if the neighbor coordinate has already been visited.
        iv. If the neighbor is within bounds and not visited:
            1.  Mark the neighbor coordinate as visited.
            2.  Check the color of the pixel at (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col) in the output grid.
            3.  If the neighbor's color is white (0):
                *   Change the color of the pixel at (neighbor\_row, neighbor\_col) in the output grid to red (2).
                *   Enqueue/push the neighbor coordinate onto the processing queue/stack.
5.  Return the modified output grid.
