White represents the background or empty space. Azure seems to represent fixed barriers or walls. Red represents a starting point and the color used for filling.\n3.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Start Point:** Each input grid contains exactly one red pixel (2). This pixel serves as the starting point for the transformation.\n    *   **Barriers:** Azure pixels (8) are present in the input grids, often forming lines or partial boundaries. These pixels remain unchanged in the output and act as barriers.\n    *   **Fill Area:** The white pixels (0) represent areas that can potentially be filled.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is a \"flood fill\" or \"paint bucket\" operation. Starting from the single red pixel, the red color spreads outwards into adjacent white pixels. The spread stops when it encounters an azure pixel or the edge of the grid.\n5.  **Connectivity:** The fill spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) to adjacent pixels. Diagonal movement is not observed.\n6.  **State Preservation:** The original red pixel and all azure pixels remain in their positions in the output grid. Only white pixels change color to red.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
