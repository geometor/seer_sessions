```python
import collections
import copy

"""
Performs a flood fill operation on a 2D grid.
The fill starts from a single 'start_color' pixel (red, 2).
It spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) into adjacent 'target_pixels' (white, 0).
The spread is blocked by 'barrier_pixels' (azure, 8) and the grid boundaries.
Barrier pixels and the original start pixel retain their color.
White pixels reachable from the start pixel without crossing barriers are changed to the 'fill_color' (red, 2).
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a flood fill transformation starting from the red pixel (2),
    filling white pixels (0) and stopping at azure barriers (8) or grid edges.

    Args:
        input_grid (list[list[int]]): The input 2D grid representing colors.

    Returns:
