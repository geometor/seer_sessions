task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - barrier_color: azure (8)
  - start_color: red (2)
  - grid_dimensions: variable height and width (observed: 11x17, 11x12, 10x13)
objects:
  - object_type: start_point
    color: red (2)
    count: 1
    description: The single pixel marking the origin of the fill. Remains red in output.
  - object_type: barriers
    color: azure (8)
    count: multiple (46, 28, 24 in examples)
    description: Impassable pixels that block the fill spread. Remain azure in output.
    shape: Can form lines, partial enclosures, scattered points.
  - object_type: fill_area
    color: white (0)
    count: multiple (140, 103, 105 in examples)
    description: Pixels representing empty space potentially reachable by the fill.
relationships:
  - relationship_type: boundary
    element1: fill_area (white pixels)
    element2: barriers (azure pixels), grid_edges
    description: Azure pixels and grid edges define the boundaries for the fill operation.
  - relationship_type: adjacency
    element1: start_point (red pixel)
    element2: fill_area (white pixels)
    description: The fill spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) from the start point into adjacent white pixels.
transformation:
  type: flood_fill (BFS)
  start_condition: Identify the single red (2) pixel.
  fill_color: red (2)
  target_pixels: white (0)
  barrier_pixels: azure (8), grid_edges (implicit barriers)
  persistence:
    - Original red pixel remains red.
    - Azure pixels remain azure.
    - Unreachable white pixels remain white.
output_features:
  - background_color: white (0) (remaining unfilled areas)
  - barrier_color: azure (8) (unchanged)
  - fill_color: red (2) (original start point + filled white pixels)
