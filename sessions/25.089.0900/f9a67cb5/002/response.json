            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement a flood fill algorithm starting from a red (2) pixel, filling adjacent white (0) pixels, and stopping at azure (8) barriers and grid boundaries. The provided execution results show that the transformation failed for all three training examples. The `Transformed Output` grids incorrectly filled almost all non-azure pixels with red, indicating that the fill process did not respect the azure barriers as intended by the logic derived from the examples.\n\nThe core logic of the Python code (BFS flood fill with checks for boundaries, visited cells, and target color) appears sound and should theoretically respect the barriers by not adding barrier cells or cells beyond them (unless reachable by another path) to the queue. The discrepancy suggests either a subtle bug in the implementation that wasn't immediately apparent, an issue in the execution environment where the test was run, or a misunderstanding of how the barriers should function (though the visual examples strongly imply they block the fill).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Barrier Logic:** Reconfirm that the intended transformation, based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs, is indeed a flood fill blocked by azure (8) pixels. (This seems correct).\n2.  **Analyze Failure Mode:** The failure mode is consistent across examples: over-filling occurs, ignoring azure barriers.\n3.  **Refine Description:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be maximally clear about the role of barriers and the fill process, based on the *intended* transformation shown in the examples, while acknowledging the discrepancy seen in the execution results. Assume the examples, not the failed execution, represent the correct transformation.\n4.  **Code Adjustment (for Coder Phase):** Although not required now, the coder will need to debug the implementation. A possible debugging step would be to reorder the checks within the loop to explicitly check for barriers *before* marking a cell as visited, even though the previous logic seemed sufficient.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze the difference between expected and actual output for Example 1 more closely.\n"
