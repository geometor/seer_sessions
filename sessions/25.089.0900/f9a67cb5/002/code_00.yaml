task_type: grid_transformation
input_features:
  - background_color: white (0)
  - barrier_color: azure (8)
  - start_color: red (2)
  - grid_dimensions: variable (height and width)
objects:
  - object_type: start_point
    color: red (2)
    count: 1
    description: The single pixel from which the fill operation originates. Remains red in the output.
  - object_type: barriers
    color: azure (8)
    count: multiple
    description: Impassable pixels that block the spread of the fill color. They remain unchanged in the output.
    shape: Can form lines, partial enclosures, or scattered points.
  - object_type: fillable_area
    color: white (0)
    count: multiple
    description: Pixels representing empty space that can potentially be filled with the start_color if reachable.
relationships:
  - relationship_type: boundary
    element1: fillable_area (white pixels)
    element2: barriers (azure pixels)
    element3: grid_edges
    description: Azure pixels and the grid edges define the boundaries for the fill operation. The fill cannot cross or pass through azure pixels.
  - relationship_type: reachability
    element1: start_point (red pixel)
    element2: fillable_area (white pixels)
    description: Only white pixels that are cardinally connected (up, down, left, right) to the start_point through a path consisting only of other white pixels will be filled.
transformation:
  type: flood_fill
  start_condition: Identify the single red (2) pixel.
  fill_color: red (2)
  target_pixels: white (0)
  barrier_pixels: azure (8)
  barrier_behavior: Barriers (azure pixels) completely block the fill; the fill cannot enter or cross them.
  connectivity: Cardinal (4-way: up, down, left, right). Diagonal movement is not allowed.
  persistence:
    - The original red pixel remains red.
    - All azure pixels remain azure.
    - White pixels not reachable from the start point without crossing a barrier remain white.
output_features:
  - background_color: white (0) (remaining unfilled areas)
  - barrier_color: azure (8) (unchanged)
  - fill_color: red (2) (original start point + filled reachable white pixels)
