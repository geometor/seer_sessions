"""
Performs a flood fill operation on a 2D grid starting from a single red (2) pixel.
The fill spreads cardinally (up, down, left, right) into adjacent white (0) pixels.
The spread is blocked by azure (8) pixels and the grid boundaries.
Azure pixels and the original red pixel remain unchanged in the output. White pixels
reachable from the start without crossing barriers are changed to red (2).
