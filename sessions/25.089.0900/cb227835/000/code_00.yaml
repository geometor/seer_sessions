task_description: Draw a line between two specified points on a grid.
elements:
  - element: grid
    role: background
    attributes:
      color: white (0)
  - element: pixel
    role: marker
    attributes:
      color: azure (8)
      count: 2
      location: distinct coordinates in the input grid.
  - element: pixel
    role: path
    attributes:
      color: green (3)
      location: forms a sequence of grid cells connecting the two marker pixels in the output grid.
relationships:
  - type: connection
    from: marker pixel 1
    to: marker pixel 2
    via: path pixels
    details: The path pixels trace the grid cells corresponding to a line segment drawn between the centers of the two marker pixels.
actions:
  - action: identify
    target: two azure (8) pixels
    input: input grid
  - action: draw_line
    start_point: location of the first azure pixel
    end_point: location of the second azure pixel
    color: green (3)
    output: set of coordinates for the path pixels
    constraints: The algorithm should select grid cells that best approximate the geometric line segment between the start and end points. The start and end points themselves are excluded from the path pixel set.
  - action: compose_output
    source_grid: input grid
    add: path pixels at their calculated coordinates
    result: output grid
