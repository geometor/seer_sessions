The output grids retain these two azure pixels in their original positions. Additionally, a path composed of green pixels (3) appears in the output grid, connecting the two azure pixels. This path seems to follow the trajectory of a straight line drawn between the coordinates of the two azure pixels, selecting the grid cells that best approximate this line. The path pixels themselves do not overlap with the original azure pixels.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
