So right col should be relevant.\n\nLet's redefine the bounding box.\nmin_r = min(p1_r, p2_r)\nmax_r = max(p1_r, p2_r)\nmin_c = min(p1_c, p2_c)\nmax_c = max(p1_c, p2_c)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2)\n    *   min_r=6, max_r=8, min_c=2, max_c=12\n    *   Expected Green: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11)], [(7, 3), (7, 11)], [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (8, 10)]\n    *   Let's trace the perimeter of the bounding box (6,2) to (8,12):\n        *   Top (r=6): (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,12)\n        *   Bottom (r=8): (8,2), (8,3), ..., (8,12)\n        *   Left (c=2): (6,2), (7,2), (8,2)\n        *   Right (c=12): (6,12), (7,12), (8,12)\n    *   The expected green pixels are *inside* the bounding box, but not necessarily on the perimeter.\n    *   Comparing P1=(6,12), P2=(8,2) and the green pixels:\n        *   Row 6 has green pixels from col 4 to col 11. P1 is at (6, 12).\n        *   Row 8 has green pixels from col 3 to col 10. P2 is at (8, 2).\n        *   Row 7 has green pixels at col 3 and col 11.\n    *   This looks like the perimeter of a *smaller* rectangle. What defines this smaller rectangle?\n    *   Maybe it's related to the midpoint? Midpoint: ((6+8)/2, (12+2)/2) = (7, 7). Doesn't seem directly related.\n\nLet's reconsider the concept of \"connecting\". Maybe it's not a geometric line or box, but related to connectivity or steps.\n\nWhat if it's drawing two lines? A horizontal line segment and a vertical line segment, meeting at a corner?\n*   **Example 1:** P1=(1, 2), P2=(10, 8).\n    *   Option 1: H-line from (1,2) to (1,8), V-line from (1,8) to (10,8). Path: (1,3)...(1,7), (2,8)...(9,8).\n    *   Option 2: V-line from (1,2) to (10,2), H-line from (10,2) to (10,8). Path: (2,2)...(9,2), (10,3)...(10,7).\n    *   Neither matches the expected output.\n\nLet's go back to the visual for Example 1.\nP1=(1, 2), P2=(10, 8)\nExpected Green:\nRow 2: (2,2), (2,3)\nRow 3: (3,2), (3,4)\nRow 4: (4,2), (4,5)\nRow 5: (5,3), (5,6)\nRow 6: (6,4), (6,7)\nRow 7: (7,5), (7,8)\nRow 8: (8,6), (8,8)\nRow 9: (9,7), (9,8)\n\nIt looks like for each row `r` between `p1_r+1` and `p2_r-1`, there are two green pixels. Their columns seem related to the columns of P1 and P2.\nLet `p1=(r1, c1)` and `p2=(r2, c2)`. Assume `r1 < r2`.\nFor row `r` from `r1+1` to `r2-1`:\nThe green pixels seem to be at `(r, c_left)` and `(r, c_right)`.\nHow are `c_left` and `c_right` determined?\n\nConsider the line equation: `c = m*r + b`.\n`m = (c2 - c1) / (r2 - r1) = (8 - 2) / (10 - 1) = 6 / 9 = 2/3`\n`b = c1 - m*r1 = 2 - (2/3)*1 = 4/3`\nLine: `c = (2/3)*r + 4/3`\n\nLet's check the expected green pixels for Ex 1:\nr=2: Expected (2,2), (2,3). Line c = (2/3)*2 + 4/3 = 4/3 + 4/3 = 8/3 approx 2.67\nr=3: Expected (3,2), (3,4). Line c = (2/3)*3 + 4/3 = 2 + 4/3 = 10/3 approx 3.33\nr=4: Expected (4,2), (4,5). Line c = (2/3)*4 + 4/3 = 8/3 + 4/3 = 12/3 = 4.0\nr=5: Expected (5,3), (5,6). Line c = (2/3)*5 + 4/3 = 10/3 + 4/3 = 14/3 approx 4.67\nr=6: Expected (6,4), (6,7). Line c = (2/3)*6 + 4/3 = 4 + 4/3 = 16/3 approx 5.33\nr=7: Expected (7,5), (7,8). Line c = (2/3)*7 + 4/3 = 14/3 + 4/3 = 18/3 = 6.0\nr=8: Expected (8,6), (8,8). Line c = (2/3)*8 + 4/3 = 16/3 + 4/3 = 20/3 approx 6.67\nr=9: Expected (9,7), (9,8). Line c = (2/3)*9 + 4/3 = 6 + 4/3 = 22/3 approx 7.33\n\nThe expected green points seem to straddle the calculated line `c`.\nFor a given row `r`, the line passes through `c_line = m*r + b`.\nThe green points seem to be around `floor(c_line)` and `ceil(c_line)`, but not exactly.\n\nLet's look at the Bresenham points again for Ex 1:\n[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (10, 8)]\nLet the Bresenham point for row `r` be `(r, c_bres)`. (Note: Bresenham might skip rows or have multiple points in a row if the line is steep, but not in this case).\nr=2: c_bres=3. Expected green: (2,2), (2,3). Neighbors?\nr=3: c_bres=3. Expected green: (3,2), (3,4). Neighbors?\nr=4: c_bres=4. Expected green: (4,2), (4,5). Neighbors?\nr=5: c_bres=5. Expected green: (5,3), (5,6). Neighbors?\nr=6: c_bres=5. Expected green: (6,4), (6,7). Neighbors?\nr=7: c_bres=6. Expected green: (7,5), (7,8). Neighbors?\nr=8: c_bres=7. Expected green: (8,6), (8,8). Neighbors?\nr=9: c_bres=7. Expected green: (9,7), (9,8). Neighbors?\n\nThis doesn't look like simple neighbors of the Bresenham line points either.\n\nLet's reconsider Example 3, where the pattern looked like a rectangle perimeter, but shifted.\nP1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2)\nmin_r=6, max_r=8, min_c=2, max_c=12\nExpected Green:\nr=6: cols 4 to 11\nr=7: cols 3, 11\nr=8: cols 3 to 10\n\nThis looks like two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, forming a rectangle, but *excluding* the corners of that rectangle *and* excluding segments adjacent to the original azure points.\nLet's define the rectangle by the two azure points P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r2, c2).\nCorners: (r1, c1), (r1, c2), (r2, c1), (r2, c2).\nPerimeter points are those on the lines:\nr = r1, c between min(c1,c2) and max(c1,c2)\nr = r2, c between min(c1,c2) and max(c1,c2)\nc = c1, r between min(r1,r2) and max(r1,r2)\nc = c2, r between min(r1,r2) and max(r1,r2)\n\nLet's try this hypothesis: Draw the rectangle defined by the two azure points P1 and P2. Color the perimeter green, but *exclude* the four corner points of this rectangle.\n\n*   **Example 3:** P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2)\n    *   Rectangle corners: (6, 2), (6, 12), (8, 2), (8, 12)\n    *   Perimeter:\n        *   r=6: (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,12)\n        *   r=8: (8,2), (8,3), ..., (8,12)\n        *   c=2: (6,2), (7,2), (8,2)\n        *   c=12: (6,12), (7,12), (8,12)\n    *   Set of perimeter points: {(6, 2), (6, 3), ..., (6, 12), (8, 2), (8, 3), ..., (8, 12), (7, 2), (7, 12)}\n    *   Exclude corners (6,2), (6,12), (8,2), (8,12): {(6, 3), ..., (6, 11), (8, 3), ..., (8, 11), (7, 2), (7, 12)}\n    *   Compare with Expected Green: [(6, 4)...(6, 11)], [(7, 3), (7, 11)], [(8, 3)...(8, 10)]\n    *   This hypothesis is also incorrect. The columns don't match perfectly, and rows/cols adjacent to the azure points seem excluded differently.\n\nLet's look at the structure again. It seems related to the bounding box but modified near the endpoints.\n\nConsider the bounding box defined by P1=(r1, c1) and P2=(r2, c2).\nmin_r, max_r, min_c, max_c.\nThe green pixels seem to be on the perimeter of *this* bounding box, but with modifications:\n1.  The original azure pixels (P1, P2) are *not* colored green.\n2.  The other two corners of the bounding box, (min_r, max_c) and (max_r, min_c), are also *not* colored green.\n3.  Pixels immediately adjacent (orthogonally) to P1 and P2 along the perimeter are also *not* colored green.\n\nLet's test this refined hypothesis (\"Bounding Box Perimeter Excluding Corners and Adjacent Segments\"):\n\n*   **Example 3:** P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2)\n    *   min_r=6, max_r=8, min_c=2, max_c=12\n    *   Corners: A=(6, 2), B=(6, 12)=P1, C=(8, 2)=P2, D=(8, 12)\n    *   Perimeter points:\n        *   Top (r=6): (6,2), (6,3), ..., (6,12)\n        *   Bottom (r=8): (8,2), (8,3), ..., (8,12)\n        *   Left (c=2): (6,2), (7,2), (8,2)\n        *   Right (c=12): (6,12), (7,12), (8,12)\n    *   Full perimeter set: {(6, 2)...(6, 12), (8, 2)...(8, 12), (7, 2), (7, 12)}\n    *   Points to exclude:\n        *   P1=(6, 12)\n        *   P2=(8, 2)\n        *   Corner A=(6, 2)\n        *   Corner D=(8, 12)\n        *   Adjacent to P1 along perimeter: (6, 11) [top edge], (7, 12) [right edge]\n        *   Adjacent to P2 along perimeter: (8, 3) [bottom edge], (7, 2) [left edge]\n    *   Remaining perimeter points:\n        *   Top edge: (6, 3), (6, 4), ..., (6, 10) --> Wait, expected was (6, 4)...(6, 11). Why is (6,3) excluded and (6,11) included?\n        *   Bottom edge: (8, 4), (8, 5), ..., (8, 11) --> Wait, expected was (8, 3)...(8, 10). Why is (8,3) included and (8,11) excluded?\n        *   Left edge: None (7,2 was excluded) --> Wait, expected had (7,3). Where did that come from?\n        *   Right edge: None (7,12 was excluded) --> Wait, expected had (7,11). Where did that come from?\n\nThis is still not right. The exclusion rule seems more complex or the basic shape is wrong.\n\nWhat if the green shape is composed of two line segments starting from P1 and P2 respectively, and ending near the *opposite* corners of the bounding box?\n\nLet's simplify. Look at the coordinates relative to the bounding box.\n*   **Example 1:** P1=(1, 2), P2=(10, 8). BB: r=[1,10], c=[2,8].\n    *   Expected Green: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,5), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,7), (7,5), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,7), (9,8)\n*   **Example 2:** P1=(0, 11), P2=(7, 2). BB: r=[0,7], c=[2,11].\n    *   Expected Green: (0,9), (0,10), (1,8), (1,10), (2,7), (2,9), (3,6), (3,8), (4,5), (4,7), (5,4), (5,6), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4)\n*   **Example 3:** P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2). BB: r=[6,8], c=[2,12].\n    *   Expected Green: (6,4)...(6,11), (7,3), (7,11), (8,3)...(8,10)\n\nMaybe it *is* Bresenham's line, but we are drawing something *around* it?\nConsider the neighbors again, but perhaps only orthogonal neighbors?\n\nLet's revisit Bresenham calculation and its neighbors for Ex 1.\nLine: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (10, 8)]\nInternal points: (2,3), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,7)\n\nOrthogonal neighbors of internal points:\n(2,3) -> (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4)\n(3,3) -> (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4)\n(4,4) -> (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5)\n(5,5) -> (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6)\n(6,5) -> (5,5), (7,5), (6,4), (6,6)\n(7,6) -> (6,6), (8,6), (7,5), (7,7)\n(8,7) -> (7,7), (9,7), (8,6), (8,8)\n(9,7) -> (8,7), (10,7), (9,6), (9,8)\n\nCollect all unique neighbors, exclude P1 and P2:\n{(1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,5), (7,7), (8,6), (8,8), (9,6), (9,8), (10,7)}\n... plus neighbors that are also on the line: {(2,3), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,7)}\n\nUnion = {(1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (10,7)}\n\nStill doesn't match Expected Green for Ex 1: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,5), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,7), (7,5), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,7), (9,8)]\n\nLet's reconsider the problem description: \"Draw a green (3) line between the two azure (8) pixels\". The initial code *did* draw a line. The results show the *wrong* line/shape. What if the specific implementation of Bresenham's was slightly different from the one ARC expects? Or maybe it's not Bresenham's but a simpler line drawing?\n\nWhat about a thick line? Like, taking the Bresenham line and coloring pixels adjacent to it?\n\nLet's consider the bounding box again.\n*   **Example 1:** P1=(1, 2), P2=(10, 8). BB: r=[1,10], c=[2,8]. dr=9, dc=6.\n*   **Example 2:** P1=(0, 11), P2=(7, 2). BB: r=[0,7], c=[2,11]. dr=7, dc=9.\n*   **Example 3:** P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2). BB: r=[6,8], c=[2,12]. dr=2, dc=10.\n\nIn Example 3, the line is closer to horizontal (dr < dc). The green pixels are mostly horizontal segments: (6, 4-11) and (8, 3-10), connected by vertical pixels (7,3) and (7,11).\nIn Example 2, the line is closer to vertical (dr < dc, if we swap points, or dr=7, dc=9). The green pixels are mostly vertical pairs: (0,9),(0,10); (1,8),(1,10); (2,7),(2,9); (3,6),(3,8); (4,5),(4,7); (5,4),(5,6); (6,3),(6,5); (7,3),(7,4).\nIn Example 1, dr=9, dc=6. Closer to vertical. The green pixels are pairs: (2,2),(2,3); (3,2),(3,4); (4,2),(4,5); (5,3),(5,6); (6,4),(6,7); (7,5),(7,8); (8,6),(8,8); (9,7),(9,8).\n\nThere's a clear pattern here based on whether the line is \"more horizontal\" or \"more vertical\".\n\nLet P1=(r1, c1), P2=(r2, c2).\ndr = abs(r1 - r2)\ndc = abs(c1 - c2)\n\n**Case 1: \"More Horizontal\" (dc >= dr), like Example 3.**\nIterate through columns `c` from `min(c1, c2)` to `max(c1, c2)`.\nFor each `c`, calculate the corresponding row `r_line` on the ideal line.\nThe green pixels seem to be at `(floor(r_line), c)` and `(ceil(r_line), c)`? No, that's not it.\n\nLet's rethink Ex 3.

Which neighbors are selected?\n\nCould it be Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm (anti-aliased)? No, colors are discrete.\n\nLet's look at the transformation from P1 to P2.\nEx 1: (1, 2) -> (10, 8). dr=9, dc=6.\nEx 2: (0, 11) -> (7, 2). dr=7, dc=-9.\nEx 3: (6, 12) -> (8, 2). dr=2, dc=-10.\n\nConsider the grid cells that the *exact* geometric line segment passes through. A green pixel is placed if the line segment intersects the cell, excluding the start and end cells? This sounds like Bresenham's or a variant. The specific implementation matters.\n\nMaybe the provided Bresenham code is slightly off compared to the one used for the ground truth? Let's re-examine the code vs the expected Bresenham points.\n\nMy Bresenham for Ex1: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (10, 8)]\nLet's compare this to the *failed* code output for Ex1:\nTransformed Output Green: (2,3), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,7).\nThis is exactly the Bresenham line points excluding the start and end points!\nSo the code correctly implemented *its* Bresenham and excluded endpoints.\n\nThe PROBLEM is that the *expected* green pixels do NOT correspond to the standard Bresenham line.\n\nWhat kind of \"connection\" or \"path\" results in the expected green pixels?\n\nLet's focus on the symmetry/pattern of the green pixels relative to the endpoints P1, P2.\nEx 1: P1=(1, 2), P2=(10, 8). Green pixels: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,5), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,7), (7,5), (7,8), (8,6), (8,8), (9,7), (9,8)]\nEx 2: P1=(0, 11), P2=(7, 2). Green pixels: [(0,9), (0,10), (1,8), (1,10), (2,7), (2,9), (3,6), (3,8), (4,5), (4,7), (5,4), (5,6), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4)]\nEx 3: P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2). Green pixels: [(6,4)...(6,11)], [(7,3), (7,11)], [(8,3)...(8,10)]\n\nMaybe it draws TWO lines from each point towards the other, stopping short?\n\nConsider the vectors:\nEx 1: V = P2 - P1 = (9, 6)\nEx 2: V = P2 - P1 = (7, -9)\nEx 3: V = P2 - P1 = (2, -10)\n\nIs it related to flood fill or pathfinding? No, it seems deterministic based on P1, P2.\n\nRevisit Example 3. P1=(6, 12), P2=(8, 2). BB: r=6..8, c=2..12.\nExpected Green:\nr=6: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (6,11)\nr=7: (7,3), (7,11)\nr=8: (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,"
