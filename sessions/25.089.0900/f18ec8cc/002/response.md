**General Assessment & Strategy**

The initial hypothesis, swapping the first and last vertical stripes identified solely by color changes in the top row, was partially correct but failed on three out of four examples. The failures indicate that either the method for identifying the "stripes" (vertical blocks of columns) or the transformation rule itself needs refinement.

Analysis of the failing examples (2, 3, 4) compared to the successful one (1) reveals:

1.  **Stripe Identification:** The method of using only the top row to find boundaries based on color changes is not robust enough (failed for Example 2). A potential refinement is needed. Example 2, with a width of 12, visually consists of 4 blocks, each 3 columns wide. This suggests a rule where if the grid width is divisible by 4, the grid is split into 4 equal blocks. Otherwise, the top-row color change method is used.
2.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation is not always a simple swap of the first and last blocks. Examples 3 and 4 exhibit a left cyclic shift of the identified blocks (`[A, B, C]` becomes `[B, C, A]`). Example 1 (and Example 2 under the revised block identification) perform a swap of the first and last blocks (`[A, B, C]` becomes `[C, B, A]` or `[A, B, C, D]` becomes `[D, B, C, A]`).

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the block identification logic: Prioritize splitting into 4 equal blocks if the width is divisible by 4. Otherwise, use the top-row color change method.
2.  Determine the transformation based on the number of blocks identified (`n`) and potentially their properties (like width):
    *   If `n = 4`: Swap the first and last blocks.
    *   If `n = 3`: Check if the middle block is strictly wider than both the first and last blocks.
        *   If yes (middle block is widest): Swap the first and last blocks.
        *   If no (middle block is not uniquely widest): Perform a left cyclic shift on the blocks.
3.  Reconstruct the output grid using the rearranged blocks.
