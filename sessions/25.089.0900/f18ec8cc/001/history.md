*   **Perception**:
    *   Each input grid appears to be composed of distinct vertical stripes or blocks of columns.
    *   Within each example, the dominant color of each vertical stripe is consistent, though some individual pixels within a stripe might differ ("noise").
    *   The number of vertical stripes varies across examples (three or four).
    *   The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
    *   The transformation seems to rearrange these vertical stripes.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, the leftmost vertical stripe and the rightmost vertical stripe appear to have swapped positions.
    *   The stripes located between the first and last ones remain in their original relative order and position between the swapped end stripes.
    *   The internal pattern of pixels within each stripe (including the "noise") is preserved during the swap.

*   **Facts**:
    
```yaml
    task_type: rearrangement
    grid_properties:
      - dimensions_preserved: True
      - content_preserved: True # Pixels are rearranged, not changed
    objects:
      - type: vertical_stripe
        definition: A block of adjacent columns characterized by a dominant color, especially in the top row.
        properties:
          - width: The number of columns in the stripe.
          - internal_pattern: The specific arrangement of pixels within the stripe's columns.
          - position: Identified as first, last, or middle.
    actions:
      - name: identify_stripes
        inputs: input_grid
        outputs: list_of_stripes_with_widths_and_column_indices
        description: Determine the vertical stripes by analyzing column blocks, likely using the top row as a guide for dominant colors and boundaries.
      - name: swap_stripes
        inputs: first_stripe_block, last_stripe_block
        outputs: rearranged_grid_sections
        description: Exchange the position of the first identified vertical stripe block with the last identified vertical stripe block.
      - name: reconstruct_grid
        inputs: last_stripe_block, middle_stripe_block(s), first_stripe_block
        outputs: output_grid
        description: Assemble the final grid by horizontally concatenating the last stripe block, followed by any middle stripe blocks in their original relative order, followed by the first stripe block.
    relationships:
      - The output grid is formed by rearranging column blocks (stripes) from the input grid.
      - The first and last vertical stripes of the input are swapped to become the last and first stripes of the output, respectively.
      - Middle stripes retain their relative order but shift position due to the end stripe swap.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the distinct vertical stripes in the input grid. Determine the columns belonging to the first stripe and the columns belonging to the last stripe. Note the columns belonging to any middle stripes.
    2.  Extract the block of columns corresponding to the first vertical stripe.
    3.  Extract the block of columns corresponding to the last vertical stripe.
    4.  Extract the block of columns corresponding to the middle stripes (if any), maintaining their internal order.
    5.  Construct the output grid by placing the extracted last stripe block first, followed by the extracted middle stripe block(s) (if any), followed by the extracted first stripe block last.
