            "text": "Okay, let's break down this task.\n\n**Perception**\n\n1.  **Input Analysis:** Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and pixels of two other distinct colors. In `train_1`, the colors are red (2) and green (3). In `train_2`, the colors are blue (1) and magenta (6).\n2.  **Object Identification:** In both examples, the non-white pixels form two distinct objects (contiguous areas of the same color).\n    *   `train_1`: A solid 4x4 green square and a more complex red shape resembling a hollow frame.\n    *   `train_2`: A solid 4x4 blue square and a more complex magenta shape.\n3.  **Output Analysis:** The output grid retains only one of the two colored objects from the input grid, preserving its shape and position. The other object is removed, replaced by the white background color.\n    *   `train_1`: The red object is kept; the green object is removed.\n    *   `train_2`: The magenta object is kept; the blue object is removed.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The key seems to be identifying which object to remove. In both examples, the object removed is a solid rectangular block (a 4x4 square). The object that remains is the one that is *not* a solid rectangle. The complexity or \"solidity\" of the shape appears to be the deciding factor. A solid rectangle has a solidity of 1 (its pixel count equals its bounding box area), while the other shapes have internal white spaces, resulting in a solidity less than 1.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
