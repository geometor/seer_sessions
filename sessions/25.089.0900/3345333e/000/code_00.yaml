components:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - role: object
    count: 2
    properties:
      color: non-white
      shape: variable
      connectivity: contiguous pixels of the same color
      bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing the object
      pixel_count: the number of pixels in the object
      solidity: calculated as (pixel_count / area of bounding_box)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two objects are separate and do not overlap.
  - type: property_comparison
    property: solidity
    description: One object consistently has a solidity of 1.0 (solid rectangle), while the other has a solidity less than 1.0.
actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of objects with their properties (color, pixels, bounding_box, pixel_count, solidity)
  - name: filter_objects
    condition: solidity == 1.0
    description: Identify the object(s) that are solid rectangles.
  - name: generate_output
    based_on: input_grid, objects_to_remove
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each pixel belonging to an object identified for removal, change its color to white (0).
transformation_goal: Remove the solid rectangular object(s) from the input grid, keeping all other elements.
