Identify all distinct, contiguous groups of non-white (non-0) pixels in the input grid. These are the \"objects\".\n2. For each identified object:\n    a. Determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all its pixels).\n    b. Calculate the area of the bounding box (width * height).\n    c. Count the number of pixels belonging to the object.\n    d. Calculate the object's \"solidity\" by dividing its pixel count by its bounding box area.\n3. Identify the object(s) whose calculated solidity is exactly 1.0. These objects are solid rectangles.\n4. Create the output grid by copying the input grid.\n5. For every pixel belonging to any identified solid rectangular object, change its color in the output grid to white (0).\n6. The modified grid is the final output.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous objects of the same non-background color in the grid.\n    Uses 8-way connectivity (including diagonals).\n\n    Args:\n        grid (np.array): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an object\n              with keys 'color' and 'pixels' (a set of (row, col) tuples).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # If pixel is background (0) or already visited, skip\n            if grid[r, c] == 0 or (r, c) in visited:\n                continue\n                \n            # Start BFS to find a new object\n            current_color = grid[r, c]\n            current_object_pixels = set()\n            q = deque([(r, c)])\n            visited.add((r, c))\n            \n            while q:\n                row, col = q.popleft()\n                current_object_pixels.add((row, col))\n                \n                # Check 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue # Skip self\n                            \n                        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n                        \n                        # Check bounds\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                            # Check if not visited and has the same color\n                            if (nr, nc) not in visited and grid[nr, nc] == current_color:\n                                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                                \n            # Store the found object\n            if current_object_pixels:\n                objects.append({'color': current_color, 'pixels': current_object_pixels})\n                \n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box for a set of pixels.\n\n    Args:\n        pixels (set): A set of (row, col) tuples.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing 'min_row', 'max_row', 'min_col', 'max_col'.\n              Returns None if the pixels set is empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not pixels:\n        return None\n        \n    min_r = min(r for r, c in pixels)\n    max_r = max(r for r, c in pixels)\n    min_c = min(c for r, c in pixels)\n    max_c = max(c for r, c in pixels)\n    \n    return {'min_row': min_r, 'max_row': max_r, 'min_col': min_c, 'max_col': max_c}\n\ndef calculate_solidity(pixel_count, bounding_box):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solidity of an object.\n\n    Args:\n        pixel_count (int): The number of pixels in the object.\n        bounding_box (dict): The bounding box dictionary.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The solidity value (pixel_count / bounding_box_area).\n               Returns 0 if bounding_box is None or area is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not bounding_box:\n        return 0.0\n        \n    bbox_height = bounding_box['max_row'] - bounding_box['min_row'] + 1\n    bbox_width = bounding_box['max_col'] - bounding_box['min_col'] + 1\n    bbox_area = bbox_height * bbox_width\n    \n    if bbox_area == 0:\n        return 0.0 # Should not happen for non-empty objects\n        \n    return pixel_count / bbox_area\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by removing solid rectangular objects.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid representation.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to numpy array for easier processing\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_np)\n    \n    # Find all non-background objects in the input grid\n    objects = find_objects(input_np)\n    \n    # Identify pixels belonging to solid rectangular objects\n    pixels_to_remove = set()\n    for obj in objects:\n        pixels = obj['pixels']\n        pixel_count = len(pixels)\n        \n        if pixel_count == 0:\n            continue\n            \n        # Calculate bounding box and solidity\n        bounding_box = get_bounding_box(pixels)\n        solidity = calculate_solidity(pixel_count, bounding_box)\n        \n        # Check if the object is a solid rectangle (solidity == 1.0)\n        # Use a small tolerance for floating point comparison\n        if abs(solidity - 1.0) < 1e-9:\n            pixels_to_remove.update(pixels)\n            \n    # Remove the identified pixels by setting them to background color (0)\n    for r, c in pixels_to_remove:\n        output_grid[r, c] = 0\n        \n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
