Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception**

1.  **Input Analysis:** Each input grid contains a white background (color 0) and pixels of two other distinct colors. In `train_1`, the colors are red (2) and green (3). In `train_2`, the colors are blue (1) and magenta (6).
2.  **Object Identification:** In both examples, the non-white pixels form two distinct objects (contiguous areas of the same color).
    *   `train_1`: A solid 4x4 green square and a more complex red shape resembling a hollow frame.
    *   `train_2`: A solid 4x4 blue square and a more complex magenta shape.
3.  **Output Analysis:** The output grid retains only one of the two colored objects from the input grid, preserving its shape and position. The other object is removed, replaced by the white background color.
    *   `train_1`: The red object is kept; the green object is removed.
    *   `train_2`: The magenta object is kept; the blue object is removed.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The key seems to be identifying which object to remove. In both examples, the object removed is a solid rectangular block (a 4x4 square). The object that remains is the one that is *not* a solid rectangle. The complexity or "solidity" of the shape appears to be the deciding factor. A solid rectangle has a solidity of 1 (its pixel count equals its bounding box area), while the other shapes have internal white spaces, resulting in a solidity less than 1.

**Facts**


```yaml
components:
  - role: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
  - role: object
    count: 2
    properties:
      color: non-white
      shape: variable
      connectivity: contiguous pixels of the same color
      bounding_box: the smallest rectangle enclosing the object
      pixel_count: the number of pixels in the object
      solidity: calculated as (pixel_count / area of bounding_box)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The two objects are separate and do not overlap.
  - type: property_comparison
    property: solidity
    description: One object consistently has a solidity of 1.0 (solid rectangle), while the other has a solidity less than 1.0.
actions:
  - name: identify_objects
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: list of objects with their properties (color, pixels, bounding_box, pixel_count, solidity)
  - name: filter_objects
    condition: solidity == 1.0
    description: Identify the object(s) that are solid rectangles.
  - name: generate_output
    based_on: input_grid, objects_to_remove
    description: Create a copy of the input grid. For each pixel belonging to an object identified for removal, change its color to white (0).
transformation_goal: Remove the solid rectangular object(s) from the input grid, keeping all other elements.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all distinct, contiguous groups of non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "objects".
2.  For each identified object:
    a.  Determine its bounding box (the smallest rectangle containing all its pixels).
    b.  Calculate the area of the bounding box (width * height).
    c.  Count the number of pixels belonging to the object.
    d.  Calculate the object's "solidity" by dividing its pixel count by its bounding box area.
3.  Identify the object(s) whose calculated solidity is exactly 1.0. These are the "solid rectangular objects".
4.  Create the output grid, initially identical to the input grid.
5.  For every pixel belonging to any identified solid rectangular object, change its color in the output grid to white (0).
6.  The modified grid is the final output.
