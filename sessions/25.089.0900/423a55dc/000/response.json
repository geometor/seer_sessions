The background color is white (0).\n2.  **Objects:** Each input grid features a single, contiguous object composed of a single non-white color (azure, magenta, green, red). The shape and position of this object vary across examples.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting the object horizontally within the grid. The object's shape, color, and vertical position remain unchanged.\n4.  **Shift Pattern:** The shift is consistently towards the left edge (column 0).\n5.  **Shift Mechanism:** Closer inspection reveals that the shift is applied independently to each row containing parts of the object. For a given row, all its pixels (including white pixels *within* the original horizontal span of the object in that row, although this doesn't affect the outcome here as only non-white pixels move) are shifted left.\n6.  **Shift Magnitude:** The magnitude of the leftward shift for each row is determined by the column index of the *first* (left-most) non-white pixel in that specific row in the input grid. This ensures that the left-most part of the object in that row aligns with column 0 in the output grid.\n7.  **Background:** Rows containing only the background color (white, 0) are unaffected and remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
