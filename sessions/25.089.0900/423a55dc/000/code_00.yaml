task_type: object_transformation
background_color: 0 # white
objects:
  - role: primary
    count: 1 # Always one object per grid
    attributes:
      - color: non-zero (varies: 8, 6, 3, 2)
      - shape: contiguous, variable (letters, blocks)
      - structure: solid or hollow
actions:
  - name: horizontal_shift
    target: primary_object
    direction: left
    granularity: per_row # Each row is shifted independently
    magnitude_rule: |
      For each row containing non-white pixels, the shift amount
      is equal to the column index of the left-most non-white
      pixel in that row.
    effect: |
      Moves the left-most non-white pixel of each object row
      to column 0. Pixels maintain their relative horizontal
      positions within the row after the shift.
relationships:
  - type: positional
    scope: row
    rule: |
      The horizontal position of pixels in the output row depends
      only on their horizontal position and the position of the
      left-most non-white pixel in the corresponding input row.
output_grid:
  - property: dimensions
    value: same_as_input
  - property: background
    value: preserved
  - property: object_content
    value: |
      Contains the primary object shifted according to the
      per-row horizontal_shift action.
