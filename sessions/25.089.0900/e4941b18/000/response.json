The gray block and the orange background remain unchanged.\n5.  **Red Pixel Movement:** The red pixel moves from its original location in the input to the location previously occupied by the azure pixel in the input.\n6.  **Azure Pixel Movement:** The azure pixel moves from its original location in the input to a new location determined by the position of the gray rectangle. Specifically, it moves to the cell located at the row index of the bottom edge of the gray rectangle and the column index immediately to the right of the right edge of the gray rectangle.\n7.  **Interaction:** The movement of the red pixel depends on the initial position of the azure pixel. The final movement of the azure pixel depends on the position (specifically the bottom-right extent) of the gray rectangle.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Let this be `(red_row_in, red_col_in)`.\n3.  Locate the coordinates of the single azure pixel (color 8) in the input grid. Let this be `(azure_row_in, azure_col_in)`.\n4.  Identify the gray rectangular block (color 5). Find the maximum row index (`gray_row_bottom`) and maximum column index (`gray_col_right`) occupied by any gray pixel.\n5.  Set the pixel at `(red_row_in, red_col_in)` in the output grid to the background color (orange 7).\n6.  Set the pixel at `(azure_row_in, azure_col_in)` in the output grid to the color of the red pixel (red 2).\n7.  Calculate the target position for the azure pixel: `(gray_row_bottom, gray_col_right + 1)`.\n8.  Set the pixel at the calculated target position `(gray_row_bottom, gray_col_right + 1)` in the output grid to the color of the azure pixel (azure 8).\n9.  Leave all other pixels (the gray rectangle and the remaining orange background) unchanged from their input values."
