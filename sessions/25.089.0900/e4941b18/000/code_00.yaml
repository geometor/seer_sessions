  - object_1:
      description: Single red pixel
      color: red (2)
      shape: 1x1 pixel
      initial_position: variable (r1_in, c1_in)
      final_position: location of object_2 in input (r2_in, c2_in)
      action: moves
  - object_2:
      description: Single azure pixel
      color: azure (8)
      shape: 1x1 pixel
      initial_position: variable (r2_in, c2_in)
      final_position: calculated based on object_3 (r3_bottom, c3_right + 1)
      action: moves
  - object_3:
      description: Gray rectangle
      color: gray (5)
      shape: rectangle (variable size)
      position: variable (defined by top-left (r3_top, c3_left) and bottom-right (r3_bottom, c3_right))
      state: static
relationships:
  - object_1's final position is determined by object_2's initial position.
  - object_2's final position is determined by object_3's bottom-right boundary.
