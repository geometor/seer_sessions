task_elements:
  - background:
      color: orange (7)
      shape: grid_fill
      state: static
  - object_1:
      description: Single red pixel
      color: red (2)
      shape: 1x1 pixel
      initial_position: variable (red_row_in, red_col_in)
      final_position: location of object_2 in input (azure_row_in, azure_col_in)
      action: moves
  - object_2:
      description: Single azure pixel
      color: azure (8)
      shape: 1x1 pixel
      initial_position: variable (azure_row_in, azure_col_in)
      final_position:
        row: bottom row index of object_3 (gray_row_bottom)
        column: conditional based on object_1 initial column (red_col_in) and object_3 left/right column bounds (gray_col_left, gray_col_right)
          - if red_col_in <= gray_col_left: column is gray_col_right + 1
          - if red_col_in > gray_col_left: column is gray_col_left - 1
      action: moves
  - object_3:
      description: Gray rectangle
      color: gray (5)
      shape: rectangle (variable size)
      position: variable (defined by top-left (gray_row_top, gray_col_left) and bottom-right (gray_row_bottom, gray_col_right))
      state: static
relationships:
  - object_1's final position is determined by object_2's initial position.
  - object_2's final row position is determined by object_3's bottom row boundary.
  - object_2's final column position is determined by comparing object_1's initial column position to object_3's left column boundary, and then using either object_3's right column boundary + 1 or object_3's left column boundary - 1.
