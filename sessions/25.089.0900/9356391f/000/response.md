*   **Perception**:
    *   The input grid contains distinct regions: a color sequence in the first row, a solid gray horizontal line in the second row, a mostly empty background (white), and a single colored "trigger" pixel somewhere in the empty area.
    *   The output grid retains the first two rows from the input, although the first row (color sequence) might be slightly modified.
    *   The main transformation is the replacement of the single trigger pixel with a large, multi-colored, layered square structure centered at the trigger pixel's original location.
    *   The colors and layering of the generated square structure are determined by the color sequence found in the first row of the input.
    *   The size of the generated structure is related to the length of the color sequence in the first row.
    *   The specific colors used in the layers correspond to the reversed sequence of colors from the first row. Repeated colors in the sequence lead to thicker layers of that color in the structure.
    *   The color of the original trigger pixel corresponds to the first color in the sequence read left-to-right, and it becomes the color at the very center of the generated structure.
    *   A potential modification occurs in the first row of the output: if the trigger pixel's column aligns with the column of the *last* color in the sequence, that color in the first row is replaced by gray.

```yaml
    elements:
      - id: sequence_row
        description: The first row (row 0) of the grid containing a sequence of colors.
        properties:
          - colors: List of colors read left-to-right until the last non-white pixel.
          - length: Number of pixels in the sequence (M).

        description: A solid horizontal line of gray pixels (color 5).

          - color: 5 (gray)
          - location: Always the second row (row 1).
      - id: trigger_pixel
        description: A single pixel in the grid that is not white (0) or gray (5) and is not part of the sequence_row or separator_line.
        properties:
          - color: C_trigger (matches the first color in the sequence_row)
          - location: (r_trigger, c_trigger)
      - id: background
        description: The remaining area of the grid.
        properties:
          - color: 0 (white)
      - id: output_structure
        description: A multi-layered square structure generated in the output grid.
        properties:
          - shape: Nested squares defined by Manhattan distance.
          - center: (r_trigger, c_trigger)
          - size: (2*M - 1) x (2*M - 1), where M is the length of the sequence_row.
          - colors: Determined by the reversed sequence_row colors mapped to Manhattan distance from the center.
          - layering: Colors from the reversed sequence fill layers based on Manhattan distance `md`, where the color is `reversed_sequence[md]`.

    actions:
      - id: find_elements
        description: Identify the sequence_row, separator_line, and trigger_pixel in the input grid.
      - id: extract_sequence
        description: Get the list of colors `S` and their length `M` from sequence_row.
      - id: determine_structure_properties
        description: Calculate the center (r_trigger, c_trigger), size (2*M-1), and color mapping (reversed `S`) for the output_structure.
      - id: generate_output_grid
        description: Create the output grid by copying the input, removing the trigger_pixel, and drawing the output_structure.
      - id: modify_sequence_row
        description: Check if the trigger_pixel's column `c_trigger` matches the column of the last color in the sequence_row. If yes, replace that color in the output grid's sequence_row with gray (5).

    relationships:
      - The trigger_pixel's color dictates the center color of the output_structure and must match the first color in the sequence_row.
      - The sequence_row's colors and length determine the colors, layering, and size of the output_structure.
      - The trigger_pixel's column position relative to the sequence_row's last element determines if the sequence_row is modified in the output.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Identify the row containing the solid horizontal gray line (color 5); this is the `separator_row`.
    2.  Identify the row directly above the `separator_row` as the `sequence_row`.
    3.  Extract the color sequence `S` from the `sequence_row`, reading from left (column 0) up to the column of the last non-white pixel. Record the length `M` of this sequence `S`.
    4.  Locate the single `trigger_pixel` in the grid, which is neither white (0) nor gray (5) and is not in the `sequence_row` or `separator_row`. Record its location `(r_trigger, c_trigger)` and color `C_trigger`.
    5.  Create the output grid, initially as a copy of the input grid.
    6.  Set the pixel at the `trigger_pixel` location `(r_trigger, c_trigger)` in the output grid to white (0).
    7.  Reverse the extracted color sequence `S` to get `S_rev`.
    8.  Draw the layered structure onto the output grid: For each pixel `(r, c)` in the grid, calculate its Manhattan distance `md = abs(r - r_trigger) + abs(c - c_trigger)`. If `md` is less than `M`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to the color `S_rev[md]`.
    9.  Check if the column index `c_trigger` of the `trigger_pixel` is the same as the column index of the last element in the original sequence `S`.
    10. If the column indices match, change the color of the pixel in the `sequence_row` at that column index in the output grid to gray (5).
    11. The resulting grid is the final output.
