Repeated colors in the sequence lead to thicker layers of that color in the structure.\n    *   The color of the original trigger pixel corresponds to the first color in the sequence read left-to-right, and it becomes the color at the very center of the generated structure.\n    *   A potential modification occurs in the first row of the output: if the trigger pixel's column aligns with the column of the *last* color in the sequence, that color in the first row is replaced by gray.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "

If `md` is less than `M`, set the color of the pixel `(r, c)` in the output grid to the color `S_rev[md]`.\n    9.
