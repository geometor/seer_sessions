            "text": "## Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe previous code generated output that differed significantly from the expected output for both training examples. The primary error lies in the geometry of the generated structure. The code used Manhattan distance (`md = |dr| + |dc|`) to determine the color layers (`color = sequence[md]`), resulting in a diamond shape. However, the expected outputs clearly show nested *square* layers.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the distance metric used for generating the structure. Instead of Manhattan distance (L1 norm), the structure appears to be based on the Chebyshev distance (L-infinity norm, or `max(|dr|, |dc|)`) where `dr` and `dc` are the row and column differences from the trigger pixel's location. The color of a pixel `(r, c)` in the output structure should be determined by `sequence[max(abs(r - r_trigger), abs(c - c_trigger))]`, provided this distance is less than the sequence length.\n\nThe other aspects of the logic (finding the separator, extracting the sequence, finding the trigger pixel, modifying the sequence row if `c_trigger == last_seq_col`) appear to be correct based on Example 2, where the sequence row modification was performed as expected.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's analyze the previous failed attempts:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   Input Size: 16x16\n*   Sequence `S`: `[1, 2, 3, 6]`, Length M=4, `last_seq_col=3`\n*   Trigger: (9, 6), Color 1.\n*   `c_trigger` (6) != `last_seq_col` (3) -> No sequence modification needed.\n*   Expected Structure: 7x7 square (since max distance = M-1 = 3, size = 2*3 + 1 = 7) centered at (9, 6), using colors S based on Chebyshev distance.\n*   Code Output Structure: Diamond based on Manhattan distance up to `md=3`.\n*   Pixels Off: 36. These incorrect pixels are primarily within the bounding box of the expected square structure, where the Manhattan distance calculation assigned the wrong color (or white) compared to the Chebyshev distance calculation.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   Input Size: 16x16\n*   Sequence `S`: `[2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 8]`, Length M=6, `last_seq_col=5`\n*   Trigger: (11, 5), Color 2.\n*   `c_trigger` (5) == `last_seq_col` (5) -> Sequence modification occurred correctly (input[0, 5] = 8 -> output[0, 5] = 5).\n*   Expected Structure: 11x11 square (since max distance = M-1 = 5, size = 2*5 + 1 = 11) centered at (11, 5), using colors S based on Chebyshev distance.\n*   Code Output Structure: Diamond based on Manhattan distance up to `md=5`.\n*   Pixels Off: 66. Similar to Example 1, the error is in the geometry of the structure due to using the wrong distance metric.\n\nThe core issue is confirmed to be the distance metric for structure generation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
