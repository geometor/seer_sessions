elements:
  - id: sequence_row
    description: The row immediately preceding the separator_line. Contains a sequence of colors defining the output structure.
    properties:
      - colors (S): List of colors read left-to-right until the last non-white pixel.
      - length (M): Number of colors in the sequence.
      - last_color_column (last_seq_col): Column index of the last color in the sequence S.
      - location: Row index = separator_row_index - 1.
  - id: separator_line
    description: A solid horizontal line of gray pixels (color 5).
    properties:
      - color: 5 (gray)
      - location: A specific row index.
  - id: trigger_pixel
    description: A single pixel below the separator_line that is not white (0) or gray (5). Its location defines the center of the output structure.
    properties:
      - color (C_trigger): The color of the pixel. (Typically matches S[0]).
      - location (r_trigger, c_trigger): Row and column index.
  - id: background
    description: The remaining area of the grid, typically white.
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
  - id: output_structure
    description: A multi-layered square structure generated in the output grid, replacing the trigger_pixel.
    properties:
      - shape: Nested squares defined by Chebyshev distance (max(|dr|, |dc|)).
      - center: (r_trigger, c_trigger)
      - size: (2*(M-1) + 1) x (2*(M-1) + 1).
      - colors: Determined by the sequence S. The color of a pixel at distance `dist = max(abs(r-r_trigger), abs(c-c_trigger))` is S[dist].
      - layering: Colors from sequence S fill layers based on Chebyshev distance `dist`, where the color is `S[dist]` if `dist < M`.

actions:
  - id: find_separator_line
    description: Locate the row index composed entirely of gray (5).
  - id: find_sequence_row
    description: Identify the row directly above the separator_line.
  - id: extract_sequence_properties
    description: Get the color list `S`, length `M`, and `last_seq_col` from sequence_row.
  - id: find_trigger_pixel
    description: Locate the single non-white, non-gray pixel `(r_trigger, c_trigger)` below the separator_line.
  - id: generate_output_grid
    description: Create the output grid by copying the input.
  - id: draw_structure
    description: Iterate through pixels (r, c). Calculate Chebyshev distance `dist = max(abs(r - r_trigger), abs(c - c_trigger))`. If `dist < M`, set output_grid[r, c] = S[dist].
  - id: modify_sequence_row
    description: Check if `c_trigger == last_seq_col`. If true, set output_grid[sequence_row_index, last_seq_col] = 5 (gray).

relationships:
  - The trigger_pixel's location defines the center of the output_structure.
  - The sequence_row's colors `S` and length `M` determine the colors, layering, and size of the output_structure based on Chebyshev distance.
  - The trigger_pixel's column position `c_trigger` relative to the sequence_row's `last_seq_col` determines if the sequence_row is modified in the output.
