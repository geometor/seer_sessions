Identify the color sequence in the first row and a trigger pixel elsewhere.
Generate a multi-layered square structure centered at the trigger pixel's location.
The layers' colors are determined by the reversed color sequence from the first row, mapped by Manhattan distance from the center.
The size of the structure depends on the length of the sequence.
Optionally modify the first row if the trigger pixel's column aligns with the last color in the sequence.
