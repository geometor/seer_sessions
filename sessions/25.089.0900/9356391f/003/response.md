Transformation Rule:
1. Identify a horizontal line of gray pixels (separator line).
2. Identify the row above the separator line as the sequence row.
3. Extract the color sequence 'S' from the sequence row up to the last non-white pixel. Let its length be 'M' and the last color's column index be 'last_seq_col'.
4. Find a single non-white, non-gray pixel below the separator line (trigger pixel). Record its location (r_trig, c_trig) and color C_trig. (C_trig should match S[0]).
5. Create an output grid, initially a copy of the input.
6. Set the original trigger pixel location in the output grid to white (0).
7. Draw a layered diamond structure centered at (r_trig, c_trig): For each pixel (r, c), calculate the Manhattan distance md = abs(r - r_trig) + abs(c - c_trig). If md < M, set the output grid pixel (r, c) to S[md].
8. Check if the trigger pixel's column c_trig equals last_seq_col.
9. If they match, change the color of the pixel at (sequence_row_index, last_seq_col) in the output grid to gray (5).
10. Return the modified output grid.
