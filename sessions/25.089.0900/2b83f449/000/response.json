            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids contain pixels of White (0), Green (3), Orange (7), and Gray (8). There's a recurring pattern of rows primarily composed of Green (3) and Gray (8) alternating with rows primarily composed of White (0) and Orange (7). The Orange (7) pixels always appear in horizontal blocks of three (`7 7 7`).\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding inputs. The Orange (7) pixels are replaced. A new color, Magenta (6), appears. The Green (3), White (0), and most Gray (8) pixels remain in their original positions. Some Gray (8) pixels are changed to Magenta (6).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems centered around the `7 7 7` Orange blocks.\n    *   Each `7 7 7` block is transformed into an `8 6 8` (Gray-Magenta-Gray) block in the same location. The middle Orange (7) becomes Magenta (6), and the flanking Orange (7) pixels become Gray (8).\n    *   Additionally, there's an effect on the pixel directly *above* the middle pixel of each original `7 7 7` block. If the pixel above the middle `7` was Gray (8) in the input, it is changed to Magenta (6) in the output. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n    *   All other pixels retain their original color and position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
