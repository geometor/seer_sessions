            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to solve the task by identifying two objects: a pattern object and an azure frame object containing a hole. It then extracted the pattern based on its bounding box and pasted it into the hole.\n\nThe results show this approach failed for both examples. The core issue seems to be the definition and extraction of the \"pattern object\". The code treated connected components of a single color as distinct objects. However, the patterns in the examples are multi-colored or consist of multiple disconnected components (if considering only single-color connectivity). The pasting logic also incorrectly ignored background pixels from the pattern area.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Frame and Hole:** Correctly identify the azure (color 8) frame and the rectangular background (color 0) hole it encloses. This part of the logic seems potentially reusable but needs verification.\n2.  **Identify Pattern Area:** Define the \"pattern\" not as a single object, but as the collection of *all* pixels that are *neither* background (0) *nor* part of the azure frame (8).\n3.  **Determine Pattern Bounding Box:** Find the minimal bounding box that encompasses all pixels identified in step 2.\n4.  **Extract Pattern Subgrid:** Extract the rectangular region defined by the pattern bounding box from the input grid. This extraction *must include* any background pixels within that bounding box.\n5.  **Paste Pattern:** Copy the input grid to the output grid. Then, paste the *entire* extracted pattern subgrid into the hole area of the output grid, aligning the top-left corner of the subgrid with the top-left corner of the hole. Do *not* ignore background pixels during pasting.\n\n**Metrics and Evidence Gathering**\n\nLet's verify the properties of the key components in each example using the revised strategy definition.\n\n"
