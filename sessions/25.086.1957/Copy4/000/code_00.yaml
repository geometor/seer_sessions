facts:
  - Rationale: Define the basic element of the grid.
    fact: The grid is composed of pixels, each having a color (represented by an integer 0-9) and a location (row, column).
  - Rationale: Define 'object' based on connectivity and color.
    fact: An object is a group of one or more contiguous pixels of the same non-white color. Contiguity includes adjacent (horizontal/vertical) and diagonal connections. (Correction: Standard ARC usually uses only horizontal/vertical adjacency. Let's assume horizontal/vertical unless evidence suggests otherwise. Re-evaluating based on H/V adjacency only).
      - Re-evaluation based on H/V adjacency:
        - Train 1: Yellow object at (1,1) is 4x5. Green object at (6,12) is 3x5. Seeds are single pixels. This still works.
        - Train 2: Green/Yellow object boundary at (3,1) is contiguous H/V. Yellow inside is contiguous H/V. Magenta objects are contiguous H/V. Seeds are single pixels. This still works.
    fact: Re-state object definition: An object is a group of one or more contiguous (sharing a side, not just a corner) pixels of the same non-white color.
  - Rationale: Identify properties of objects needed for the transformation.
    fact: Objects have properties including:
      - color: The color of the pixels forming the object.
      - pixels: The set of coordinates {(row, col)} belonging to the object.
      - size: The number of pixels in the object.
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle containing all pixels of the object, defined by {min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col}.
      - is_seed: A boolean property, true if the object size is 1, false otherwise.
  - Rationale: Identify the source pattern for copying.
    fact: For each non-white color present in the input grid, there might be a 'template pattern'.
    fact: The 'template pattern' for a given color is determined by finding the object of that color with the largest size (pixel count).
    fact: The actual template copied is the rectangular region of the grid defined by the bounding box of this largest object. This region might contain pixels of colors other than the object's primary color.
  - Rationale: Identify the trigger for the copying action.
    fact: 'Seed' objects (objects of size 1) trigger the copying action.
  - Rationale: Describe the copying action itself.
    fact: When a seed object of a specific color is found at location (seed_row, seed_col):
      - The 'template pattern' associated with that color is retrieved.
      - This template pattern (a rectangular grid patch) is copied onto the output grid.
  - Rationale: Specify the placement rule for the copied pattern.
    fact: The top-left corner of the copied template pattern is placed at the location (seed_row, seed_col) of the seed object.
  - Rationale: Specify how copying interacts with existing grid content.
    fact: The copy operation overwrites the pixels in the destination area on the output grid.
  - Rationale: Specify what happens to non-participating elements.
    fact: All pixels from the input grid that are not overwritten by a copy operation are retained in their original positions in the output grid.
