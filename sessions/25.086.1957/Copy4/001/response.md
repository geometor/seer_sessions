"""
Identifies 'seed' pixels (single pixels of a non-white color) and uses them as anchor points to copy patterns.
The pattern associated with a seed color is derived from the bounding box content of the largest contiguous object of that same color found elsewhere in the input grid.
The copied pattern overwrites the existing grid content at the target location, starting with the top-left of the pattern aligned with the seed pixel's location.
Pixels not part of a seed or overwritten by a pattern copy remain unchanged.

Workflow:
1. Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Find all unique non-white colors present in the input grid.
3. For each unique color C:
    a. Find all contiguous objects of color C using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Record their pixel coordinates and sizes.
    b. Identify objects of size 1 (seed pixels) and objects larger than 1.
    c. If there are seed pixels of color C and also larger objects of color C:
        i. Find the largest object(s) of color C among those with size > 1.
        ii. If multiple objects share the maximum size, select one (e.g., the first one found, or based on top-left position).
        iii. Determine the bounding box of the selected largest object.
        iv. Extract the rectangular region (template pattern) from the *input grid* corresponding to this bounding box.
        v. For each seed pixel of color C at location (r, c):
            - Paste the extracted template pattern onto the *output grid*, with the top-left of the template placed at (r, c). Handle boundary clipping if the pattern extends beyond the grid edges.
4. Return the final output grid.
