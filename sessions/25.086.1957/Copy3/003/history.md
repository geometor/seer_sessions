"""
This program transforms an input grid based on the presence or absence of magenta (6) pixels.

1.  **Check for Magenta:** Determine if any magenta pixels exist in the input grid.

2.  **If Magenta is Absent:**
    a.  Calculate a horizontal shift: `shift_col = width // 2 - 1`. Vertical shift is 0.
    b.  Identify all non-white objects fully contained within the left half of the grid (columns 0 to `width // 2 - 1`).
    c.  Copy each of these objects, applying the calculated shift `(0, shift_col)` to each pixel's coordinates.
    d.  Draw the copied objects onto the output grid (initialized as a copy of the input).

3.  **If Magenta is Present:**
    a.  Identify all non-white objects and find the one with the largest area (most pixels).
    b.  Identify all distinct magenta objects.
    c.  Determine the top-left coordinate for each magenta object.
    d.  Sort these top-left coordinates first by row, then by column.
    e.  Select the coordinates of the *second* magenta object in the sorted list. These coordinates `(shift_row, shift_col)` define the shift vector.
    f.  Copy the largest non-white object, applying the shift vector `(shift_row, shift_col)` to each of its pixels.
    g.  Draw the copied largest object onto the output grid.

The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid, and the copied objects overwrite existing pixels at their new locations.

## General Assessment

The provided code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Example 2. Example 1 lacks magenta pixels, while Example 2 contains them. This strongly suggests the logic branch handling the presence of magenta pixels is flawed.

The failure in Example 2 resulted in 4 incorrect pixels. The `Transformed Output` matches the `Expected Output` except for 4 yellow pixels that should have been part of the copied object but were missing. This indicates the error lies in identifying or copying the correct object when magenta is present. Specifically, the previous code identified the "largest object" based on the size of *single-color* contiguous components. However, Example 2 requires copying a *multi-color* composite object. The shift vector calculation based on the second magenta marker appears correct, but the object selected for shifting was incomplete.

The strategy is to:
1.  Refine the definition of the object to be copied in the "magenta present" case. It should be the contiguous group of non-white pixels connected to the most top-left non-white pixel in the input grid, regardless of internal color variations.
2.  Update the object identification logic in the code for the magenta case.
3.  Verify the logic for the "no magenta" case remains correct based on Example 1.

## Metrics and Analysis

We will use `tool_code` to analyze the grids and verify object properties.

**Example 1 (No Magenta):**

*   Input Grid Size: 11x16
*   Magenta Present: No
*   Shift Calculation: `width = 16`. `shift_col = 16 // 2 - 1 = 7`. Shift vector `(0, 7)`.
*   Objects in Left Half (cols 0-7): Multiple small objects of yellow, blue, and green.
*   Action: Copy all objects entirely within columns 0-7, shifting them by `(0, 7)`.
*   Result: Match. The logic seems correct for this case.

**Example 2 (Magenta Present):**

*   Input Grid Size: 15x13
*   Magenta Present: Yes
*   Objects (using a conceptual multi-color finder for the composite object):
    *   Source Composite Object (Top-Left): A multi-color object comprising green, yellow, and orange pixels starting near (2,0).

**Analysis of `tool_code` Output:**

*   **Error in `find_composite_object_at_top_left`:** The function reported a size of 2. Looking at the code, it seems the BFS only included the starting node `(0,0)` and its neighbor `(0,1)` because the starting node itself was magenta (6), and the BFS didn't correctly expand to *different* non-background colors. The BFS condition `grid[nr, nc] != 0` is correct, but the implementation seems flawed. The start node should be the first *non-magenta* pixel if we assume magenta marks things but isn't part of the object to copy. Let's re-evaluate.

*   **Revisiting Example 2 Input/Output:**
    *   Input: Magenta at (0,0), (0,1). First non-white, non-magenta pixel is green (3) at (2,0).
    *   Hypothesis: Maybe the "source object" starts from the first non-white pixel that *isn't* magenta?
    *   Let's recalculate the composite object starting from (2,0).

```
Source composite object (non-marker) size: 12
First non-marker pixel used as start: (2, 0)
Calculated shift vector: (3, 6)
Are the previously missing pixels present in the shifted composite object? True

```
*   **Confirmation:** The second `tool_code` execution confirms that:
    *   The source object to be copied is the contiguous group of non-magenta pixels connected (via any non-white pixels) to the first non-magenta, non-white pixel found (scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right). In Example 2, this object starts at (2,0) and has 12 pixels.
    *   The magenta objects are separate markers.
    *   The top-left coordinates of the magenta markers are (0,0), (3,6), (8,2), (11,8).
    *   Sorting these gives [(0,0), (3,6), (8,2), (11,8)].
    *   The second coordinate is (3,6), which defines the shift vector `(shift_row, shift_col)`.
    *   Applying this shift `(3, 6)` to the 12 pixels of the source object correctly places them, including the 4 yellow pixels that were missing in the previous attempt.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
task_description: Copies objects based on the presence or absence of magenta markers. The output grid starts as a copy of the input.

conditions:
  - name: No Magenta Markers
    condition: The input grid contains no magenta (color 6) pixels.
    actions:
      - action: Calculate Shift
        details: shift_row = 0, shift_col = floor(grid_width / 2) - 1.
      - action: Identify Objects
        details: Find all single-color, non-white objects located entirely within the left half of the grid (columns 0 to floor(grid_width / 2) - 1). Use 8-way connectivity.
      - action: Copy Objects
        details: For each identified object, copy its pixels to the output grid, applying the calculated shift (shift_row, shift_col) to each pixel's coordinates. Overwrite existing pixels.

  - name: Magenta Markers Present
    condition: The input grid contains at least one magenta (color 6) pixel.
    assumptions: Requires at least two distinct magenta objects to define the shift.
    actions:
      - action: Identify Source Object
        details: Find the first non-white, non-magenta pixel scanning top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Perform a search (e.g., BFS/DFS) starting from this pixel to find all connected non-white pixels (using 8-way connectivity). The "Source Object" consists of all pixels in this connected component *excluding* any magenta pixels.
      - action: Identify Magenta Markers
        details: Find all distinct magenta (color 6) objects using 8-way connectivity.
      - action: Determine Marker Positions
        details: Calculate the top-left coordinate (minimum row, then minimum column) for each distinct magenta object.
      - action: Calculate Shift
        details: Sort the magenta marker top-left coordinates first by row, then by column. The shift vector (shift_row, shift_col) is the coordinate pair of the *second* marker in the sorted list.
      - action: Copy Source Object
        details: Copy the pixels of the "Source Object" (the non-magenta parts of the connected component found earlier) to the output grid, applying the calculated shift (shift_row, shift_col) to each pixel's coordinates. Overwrite existing pixels.

common_elements:
  - Background Color: White (0)
  - Connectivity: 8-way (including diagonals) for object identification.
  - Output Grid: Starts as a copy of the input grid; copied objects overwrite existing pixels.
  - Object Definition (No Magenta Case): Contiguous block of same non-white color.
  - Object Definition (Magenta Case - Source Object): Contiguous block of non-white pixels connected to the first non-magenta pixel found, excluding magenta pixels within the block.
  - Object Definition (Magenta Case - Markers): Contiguous block of magenta pixels.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Check if any magenta (color 6) pixels exist in the input grid.
3.  **If no magenta pixels are present:**
    a.  Calculate a horizontal shift amount: `shift_col = floor(grid_width / 2) - 1`. The vertical shift `shift_row` is 0.
    b.  Identify all distinct, single-color, non-white objects that are located entirely within the left half of the grid (columns 0 to `floor(grid_width / 2) - 1`). Use 8-way connectivity.
    c.  For each such object found, copy its pixels. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the object, draw its color at the new coordinate `(r + shift_row, c + shift_col)` on the output grid, overwriting any existing pixel.
4.  **If magenta pixels are present:**
    a.  Find the coordinate `(start_r, start_c)` of the first pixel (scanning top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) that is neither white (0) nor magenta (6). If no such pixel exists, stop.
    b.  Perform a search (like BFS or DFS) starting from `(start_r, start_c)` to find all reachable non-white pixels using 8-way connectivity.
    c.  Define the "Source Object" as the set of all pixels found in step 4b that are *not* magenta. Store their original coordinates and colors.
    d.  Identify all distinct magenta objects (contiguous blocks of color 6) using 8-way connectivity.
    e.  For each distinct magenta object, find its top-left coordinate (the pixel with the minimum row, and among those, the minimum column).
    f.  Collect all unique top-left coordinates of the magenta objects.
    g.  Sort these coordinates first by row index, then by column index.
    h.  If there are fewer than two sorted coordinates, stop. Otherwise, select the *second* coordinate pair in the sorted list as the shift vector `(shift_row, shift_col)`.
    i.  Copy the "Source Object". For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `clr` in the Source Object, draw the color `clr` at the new coordinate `(r + shift_row, c + shift_col)` on the output grid, overwriting any existing pixel.
5.  Return the final output grid.
