            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code successfully solved Example 1 but failed on Example 2. Example 1 lacks magenta pixels, while Example 2 contains them. This strongly suggests the logic branch handling the presence of magenta pixels is flawed.\n\nThe failure in Example 2 resulted in 4 incorrect pixels. The `Transformed Output` matches the `Expected Output` except for 4 yellow pixels that should have been part of the copied object but were missing. This indicates the error lies in identifying or copying the correct object when magenta is present. Specifically, the previous code identified the \"largest object\" based on the size of *single-color* contiguous components. However, Example 2 requires copying a *multi-color* composite object. The shift vector calculation based on the second magenta marker appears correct, but the object selected for shifting was incomplete.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Refine the definition of the object to be copied in the \"magenta present\" case. It should be the contiguous group of non-white pixels connected to the most top-left non-white pixel in the input grid, regardless of internal color variations.\n2.  Update the object identification logic in the code for the magenta case.\n3.  Verify the logic for the \"no magenta\" case remains correct based on Example 1.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nWe will use `tool_code` to analyze the grids and verify object properties.\n\n**Example 1 (No Magenta):**\n\n*   Input Grid Size: 11x16\n*   Magenta Present: No\n*   Shift Calculation: `width = 16`. `shift_col = 16 // 2 - 1 = 7`. Shift vector `(0, 7)`.\n*   Objects in Left Half (cols 0-7): Multiple small objects of yellow, blue, and green.\n*   Action: Copy all objects entirely within columns 0-7, shifting them by `(0, 7)`.\n*   Result: Match. The logic seems correct for this case.\n\n**Example 2 (Magenta Present):**\n\n*   Input Grid Size: 15x13\n*   Magenta Present: Yes\n*   Objects (using a conceptual multi-color finder for the composite object):\n    *   Source Composite Object (Top-Left): A multi-color object comprising green, yellow, and orange pixels starting near (2,0).\n"

Check if any magenta (color 6) pixels exist in the input grid.\n3.  **If no magenta pixels are present:**\n    a.  Calculate a horizontal shift amount: `shift_col = floor(grid_width / 2) - 1`. The vertical shift `shift_row` is 0.\n    b.  Identify all distinct, single-color, non-white objects that are located entirely within the left half of the grid (columns 0 to `floor(grid_width / 2) - 1`). Use 8-way connectivity.\n    c.  For each such object found, copy its pixels. For each pixel `(r, c)` in the object, draw its color at the new coordinate `(r + shift_row, c + shift_col)` on the output grid, overwriting any existing pixel.\n4.  **If magenta pixels are present:**\n    a.  Find the coordinate `(start_r, start_c)` of the first pixel (scanning top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) that is neither white (0) nor magenta (6). If no such pixel exists, stop.\n    b.  Perform a search (like BFS or DFS) starting from `(start_r, start_c)` to find all reachable non-white pixels using 8-way connectivity.\n    c.  Define the \"Source Object\" as the set of all pixels found in step 4b that are *not* magenta. Store their original coordinates and colors.\n    d.  Identify all distinct magenta objects (contiguous blocks of color 6) using 8-way connectivity.\n    e.  For each distinct magenta object, find its top-left coordinate (the pixel with the minimum row, and among those, the minimum column).\n    f.  Collect all unique top-left coordinates of the magenta objects.\n    g.  Sort these coordinates first by row index, then by column index.\n    h.  If there are fewer than two sorted coordinates, stop. Otherwise, select the *second* coordinate pair in the sorted list as the shift vector `(shift_row, shift_col)`.\n    i.  Copy the \"Source Object\". For each pixel `(r, c)` with color `clr` in the Source Object, draw the color `clr` at the new coordinate `(r + shift_row, c + shift_col)` on the output grid, overwriting any existing pixel.\n5.  Return the final output grid."
