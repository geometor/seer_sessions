An isolated pixel \nis one with no neighbors (orthogonally or diagonally) of the same color. \nEach isolated pixel is then expanded into a 3x3 pattern centered on its \noriginal location in the output grid. The specific 3x3 pattern depends on the \ncolor of the isolated pixel:\n- Color 1 (Blue): Solid 3x3 square.\n- Color 2 (Red): 3x3 plus sign (+).\n- Color 3 (Green): 3x3 diamond/X shape (center and diagonals).\n- Color 6 (Magenta): 3x3 solid square minus horizontal neighbors (vertical bar hollow).\n- Color 8 (Azure): 3x3 hollow square (perimeter).\nPixels that are not isolated remain unchanged. Expansions overwrite existing \npixels in the output grid, potentially overlapping. The background color is 0.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef is_within_bounds(r, c, height, width):\n    \"\"\"Checks if coordinates (r, c) are within the grid boundaries.\"\"\"\n    return 0 <= r < height and 0 <= c < width\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by expanding isolated pixels into specific 3x3 patterns\n    based on their color.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A list of lists representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists representing the transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    #
