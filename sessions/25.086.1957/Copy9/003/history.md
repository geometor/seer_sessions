**Confirmation:** The code execution confirms my manual check:
*   Example 1: Blue (1) at (5,6) is isolated.
*   Example 2: Red (2) at (1,3) and Green (3) at (9,5) are isolated. The other green pixels are *not* isolated.
*   Example 3: Magenta (6) at (1,9) and Azure (8) at (5,6) are isolated.

This confirms step 1 (Identify Target Pixels) is correct. The error lies entirely in step 2 (Determine Expansion Shape) and step 3 (Apply Transformation). The previous code applied only the "Solid 3x3" shape for all colors.

**Refined Plan:**
1.  Keep the logic for identifying isolated pixels.
2.  Modify the transformation application step. Instead of always drawing a 3x3 solid square, determine the correct 3x3 pattern based on the isolated pixel's color.
3.  Implement drawing functions or logic for each required pattern:
    *   Solid Square (Color 1)
    *   Plus (Color 2)
    *   Diamond (Color 3)
    *   Hollow Square (Color 8)
    *   Vertical Bar Hollow (Color 6)
4.  The application process should still copy the input grid and draw onto the copy to avoid interference between expansions.

This plan seems robust and addresses the discrepancies observed in examples 2 and 3.## General Assessment

The previous code correctly identified the core concept of finding "isolated" pixels (those with no neighbors of the same color, including diagonals) and expanding them. However, it incorrectly assumed that the expansion always results in a 3x3 solid square. The analysis of failed examples (2 and 3) reveals that the *shape* of the 3x3 expansion pattern depends on the *color* of the isolated pixel.

The strategy moving forward is:
1.  Retain the logic for identifying isolated pixels based on the 8-neighbor rule.
2.  Modify the transformation step to apply different 3x3 patterns based on the color of the isolated pixel.
3.  Define the specific 3x3 pattern associated with each observed color (Blue=1, Red=2, Green=3, Magenta=6, Azure=8).
4.  Ensure the transformation applies these patterns centered on the isolated pixel's original location onto a copy of the input grid.

          C 0 C -> This pattern seems wrong. It's Center + Diagonals *relative to the 3x3*
          Relative coordinates (-1,-1), (-1,1), (0,0), (1,-1), (1,1) should be filled.
          Let's represent the 3x3 pattern itself:
          Color 3 Pattern (Center (r,c)):
            (r-1, c-1): Color
            (r-1, c+1): Color
            (r,   c  ): Color
            (r+1, c-1): Color
            (r+1, c+1): Color
            Others in 3x3: Background (0)
          Visual:
          C 0 C
          0 C 0
          C 0 C -> No, center is (r,c). So:
          C 0 C
          0 C 0
          C 0 C -> Still seems wrong. Let's check expected again:
          Row 8: 3 0 3 (relative positions: (-1,-1), (-1,0)=Bg!, (-1,1))
          Row 9: 0 3 0 (relative positions: (0,-1)=Bg!, (0,0), (0,1)=Bg!)
          Row 10: 3 0 3 (relative positions: (1,-1), (1,0)=Bg!, (1,1))
          Okay, the pattern IS: Center + Diagonals.
          Visual (C=Color, 0=Background):
          C 0 C
          0 C 0
          C 0 C

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output grid as an identical copy of the input grid.
2.  Scan the input grid to find all "isolated" non-background pixels. An isolated pixel is defined as a non-background colored pixel that has no adjacent neighbors (including diagonals) of the *same* color. Store the location (row, column) and color of each isolated pixel found.
3.  For each isolated pixel identified in step 2:
    a.  Determine the specific 3x3 expansion pattern based on the pixel's color:
        *   If the color is Blue (1), the pattern is a solid 3x3 square.
        *   If the color is Red (2), the pattern is a 3x3 plus sign ('+') shape (center and orthogonal neighbors filled, corners are background).
        *   If the color is Green (3), the pattern is a 3x3 diamond ('X') shape (center and diagonal neighbors filled, orthogonal neighbors are background).
        *   If the color is Magenta (6), the pattern is a 3x3 solid square with the middle-left and middle-right cells set to background ('vertical bar hollow').
        *   If the color is Azure (8), the pattern is a 3x3 hollow square (perimeter filled, center is background).
        *   (Assume any other color defaults to a specific pattern, e.g., solid square, or leaves the pixel unchanged if not specified - based on examples, only these colors appear as isolated pixels).
    b.  Apply this 3x3 pattern onto the output grid, centered at the isolated pixel's original location. Use the isolated pixel's color for the filled parts of the pattern and the background color (0) for the specified empty parts within the 3x3 area.
    c.  Ensure that drawing the pattern respects the grid boundaries; do not attempt to write outside the grid dimensions.
    d.  The pattern overwrites any existing values in the output grid within the 3x3 area.
4.  Return the modified output grid.
