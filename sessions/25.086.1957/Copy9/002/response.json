            "text": "**Confirmation:** The code execution confirms my manual check:\n*   Example 1: Blue (1) at (5,6) is isolated.\n*   Example 2: Red (2) at (1,3) and Green (3) at (9,5) are isolated. The other green pixels are *not* isolated.\n*   Example 3: Magenta (6) at (1,9) and Azure (8) at (5,6) are isolated.\n\nThis confirms step 1 (Identify Target Pixels) is correct. The error lies entirely in step 2 (Determine Expansion Shape) and step 3 (Apply Transformation). The previous code applied only the \"Solid 3x3\" shape for all colors.\n\n**Refined Plan:**\n1.  Keep the logic for identifying isolated pixels.\n2.  Modify the transformation application step. Instead of always drawing a 3x3 solid square, determine the correct 3x3 pattern based on the isolated pixel's color.\n3.  Implement drawing functions or logic for each required pattern:\n    *   Solid Square (Color 1)\n    *   Plus (Color 2)\n    *   Diamond (Color 3)\n    *   Hollow Square (Color 8)\n    *   Vertical Bar Hollow (Color 6)\n4.  The application process should still copy the input grid and draw onto the copy to avoid interference between expansions.\n\nThis plan seems robust and addresses the discrepancies observed in examples 2 and 3.## General Assessment\n\nThe previous code correctly identified the core concept of finding \"isolated\" pixels (those with no neighbors of the same color, including diagonals) and expanding them. However, it incorrectly assumed that the expansion always results in a 3x3 solid square. The analysis of failed examples (2 and 3) reveals that the *shape* of the 3x3 expansion pattern depends on the *color* of the isolated pixel.\n\nThe strategy moving forward is:\n1.  Retain the logic for identifying isolated pixels based on the 8-neighbor rule.\n2.  Modify the transformation step to apply different 3x3 patterns based on the color of the isolated pixel.\n3.  Define the specific 3x3 pattern associated with each observed color (Blue=1, Red=2, Green=3, Magenta=6, Azure=8).\n4.  Ensure the transformation applies these patterns centered on the isolated pixel's original location onto a copy of the input grid.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the code execution and manual analysis:\n\n"
