"""
Identify two distinct non-background objects in the input grid.
One object (source) contains pixels of at least two different non-background colors.
The other object (target) contains pixels of only one non-background color.
Determine the less frequent non-background color within the source object; this is the 'pattern_color'.
Determine the single non-background color of the target object; this is the 'target_color'.
Find the bounding boxes of both the source and target objects based on their constituent pixels.
Map the locations of the 'pattern_color' pixels from within the source object's bounding box to the corresponding relative locations within the target object's bounding box.
Change the color of the pixels in the output grid at these target locations to 'pattern_color', but only if the original color at that location in the input grid was the 'target_color'.
All other pixels remain unchanged from the input grid.
