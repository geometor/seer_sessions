"""
1.  **Identify Trigger and Target:** Locate all yellow (4) and red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine the area between yellow (4) pixels, considering rows and columns.** A yellow pixel will be either at the start or the end of the row or column.
3.  **Replace with Azure:** Within that range of rows and columns, replace all red (2) pixels by Azure (8).
4. **Background Preservation**: Black Pixels (0) remain in place, unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and a YAML fact sheet.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code have significant flaws. The core idea of identifying yellow and red pixels and using them to define a region for transformation is partially correct, but the implementation misses several critical aspects, especially when it doesn't create correct connectivity. The initial assumption that yellow forms the start and end bounds is a good start. The code also does not yet handle columns correctly.

The provided code attempts to perform the transformations row-wise *and* column-wise, separately. It doesn't combine the row and column information properly to form coherent shapes, or the overall "maze" pattern. There are multiple failures that demonstrate that the current approach is not correct, in the results of the tests.

The strategy to resolve these issues will involve:

1.  **Re-evaluating Object Relationships:** Instead of thinking strictly in terms of row and column ranges defined by yellows, we need to consider paths, connected components, or "walls" formed by the non-black pixels.
2.  **Connectivity:** The core concept is creating "walls" or paths. The transformation involves changing reds to azures to "complete" the walls between yellows, ensuring connectivity and creating enclosed regions (or a maze-like structure).
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will need to use both examples to iteratively build and test the updated natural language program and the resulting code. It might be helpful to visually represent paths and examine properties such as connectivity between yellow pixels.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when necessary)**

Let's examine the provided examples more closely.

**Example 1:**

*   Input: 5x5 grid. Yellow (4) pixels at (0,0) and (4,3). Red (2) pixels scattered.
*   Expected Output: Shows a connected "wall" of azure (8) pixels forming an L shape between yellows.
*   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Only a few red pixels changed to azure. Fails to create connections along rows or columns, and doesn't do it consistently.

**Example 2:**

*   Input: 5x5 grid. Yellow (4) pixels at (0,0) and (4,4). Red (2) pixels scattered.
*   Expected Output: Shows a connected "wall" of azure (8) pixels that looks like a wider L shape with projections.
*   Transformed Output: Incorrect, similar issues as Example 1. No connectivity established.

The outputs clearly do not match the examples, due to not correctly finding the area to transform.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Find all yellow (4) and red (2) pixels in the input grid. Black pixels are considered background and do not change.

2.  **Yellow Pixel Pairs:** Consider pairs of yellow pixels.

3.  **Path Creation:**  For each yellow pixel (or pair, if clearly related by being the only yellows in a row or column, or by being at the "ends" of a diagonal):
    *   Find Red pixels (2) that lie on direct horizontal or vertical paths, which are obstructed only by other red pixels.
    *   Change those red pixels to azure (8).

4. Result: The output is the original grid with red pixels that connect the yellows changed to azure.
