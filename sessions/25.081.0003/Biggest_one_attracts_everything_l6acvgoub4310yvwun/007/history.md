The transformation rule works as follows:
1. Identify Non-Empty Rows: Examine each row in the input grid. A row is considered "non-empty" if it contains any digit other than 0.
2. Shift Non-Empty Rows Upwards: Arrange all non-empty rows sequentially at the top of the output grid, maintaining their relative order from the input.
3. Fill Remaining with empty rows: insert empty (all 0) rows to bottom of the grid until the input and output grid have the same height.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code focused on identifying and shifting non-empty rows to the top. This approach is partially correct but fails to account for a crucial aspect of the transformation: the specific rearrangement of non-zero digits *within* the non-empty rows. The current implementation simply preserves the original order of non-zero digits within each row, while the examples show they are being reordered and sometimes even merged. The strategy must therefore focus on understanding the *intra-row* transformations, in addition to the row-shifting.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Intra-Row Transformations:** Carefully examine how the non-zero digits within each row are reordered in the output compared to the input. Look for patterns related to position, color, or other properties. Specifically look for the merging of colors, and consider mirroring.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to incorporate the observed intra-row transformation rules.
3.  **Modify Code:** Adapt the Python code to implement the refined transformation logic, paying close attention to how digits within each row are handled.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the revised code against all available examples and repeat the analysis and refinement process until all examples are matched correctly.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection):**


```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    output_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    observations: |
      - Row 2 (8 8 0 5 0) becomes (8 8 5 0 0). The 5 moved from index 3 to index 2.
      - Row 3 (8 8 0 5 0) becomes (8 8 5 0 0). The 5 moved from index 3 to index 2.
      - Row 5 (0 7 0 0 0) becomes (0 7 0 0 0), unchanged.
      - Non-zero digits are rearranged; zero digits pad other positions.
      - There appears to be merging of some digits
    discrepancies:
      - The non-zero digits aren't correctly repositioned within the rows.

  - example_id: 2
    input_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    output_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    observations: |
      - Row 1 (8 0 7 7 7) becomes (0 8 7 7 7) - 8 moves to after the 0s to its right, which is consistent with the rule.
      - Row 3 (0 0 4 0 0) becomes (0 0 4 0 6). The last non-zero value appears in the position of the final 0.
      - Row 4/5 (0 0 0 0 6) are unchanged, then combined/merged
      - There appears to be merging of some digits
    discrepancies:
      - The non-zero digits aren't correctly repositioned within the rows.

  - example_id: 3
    input_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    output_grid_shape: (5, 5)
    observations: |
        - Row 1: (0 7 7 7 0) is unchanged.
        - Row 3: (0 9 9 9 0) is unchanged.
        - Row 4: (0 9 9 9 6) is unchanged.
      - There appears to be merging of some digits
    discrepancies:
        - Non-empty rows are moved to top, but they are not merged.
```


**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: rows x columns

  - name: row
    properties:
      - type: 1D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - property: can be empty (all zeros) or non-empty (contains at least one non-zero digit)

actions:
  - name: shift_rows
    description: Moves non-empty rows upwards, maintaining relative order.
  - name: rearrange_digits
    description: Rearranges non-zero digits within each row based on a specific rule (yet to be fully determined). It does *not* appear to be a simple sort. Some values may be combined.
  - name: pad_rows
    description: Adds empty rows to ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Empty Rows:** Examine each row in the input grid. A row is "non-empty" if it contains any digit other than 0.

2.  **Shift Non-Empty Rows Upwards:** Arrange all non-empty rows sequentially at the top of the output grid, maintaining their original relative order.

3.  **Rearrange Non-Zero Digits Within Rows:** Within each non-empty row, rearrange the non-zero digits based on these principles:
    *   Zeroes to the left of non-zero digits: remain to the left.
    *   Zeroes to the right: pad the remaining space.
    *   Merging: If two rows have non-zero values and all values are equal except
        the last, then consolidate to a single row.

4.  **Fill Remaining Rows:** Insert empty (all 0) rows to the bottom of the grid until the input and output grid have the same height.
