Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concepts of object extraction, rotation, and placement. However, the centering logic is flawed. It appears to calculate the center based on the *original* object's position and then attempts to center the *rotated* object relative to that point. This doesn't account for the change in dimensions after rotation, leading to incorrect placement, as seen in all three test cases. The code also doesn't handle the shifting of the pixels when the object is centered.

**Strategy:**

The key to fixing this is to recalculate the center of the output grid *independently* and place the rotated object centered within *that* grid. The object should always be moved.
The original position is used only as reference for finding the object to rotate.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's analyze each example to pinpoint the exact issues:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Object: 3x3 (including padding 0's), color 2 (red)
    *   Expected: Object rotated 90 degrees clockwise and centered.
    *   Actual: The object is placed in top-left corner from where it started.
    *   Issue: Incorrect centering after rotation.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Object: 3x3, color 5 (gray)
    *   Expected: Object rotated 90 degrees clockwise and centered.
    *   Actual: The object is slightly off-center.
    *   Issue: Incorrect centering after rotation.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input object: 5 x 5, non zero section, color 6 (magenta)
    *   Expected: object rotated 90 degrees and centered.
    *   Actual: The object is moved down too far, not centered vertically.
    *   Issue: Centering, not taking dimensions of the rotated objects into account

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the input grid that contains all non-zero pixels. This is the object.
2.  **Determine Dimensions:** Calculate the width and height of this rectangular object.
3.  **Rotate:** Rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise. This swaps the object's width and height.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid (all pixels set to 0) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5.  **Center the Object:**
    *   Calculate the center row and center column of the *output* grid.
    *   Calculate the starting row and starting column for placing the rotated object. These are determined by subtracting half the rotated object's height and width, respectively, from the output grid's center row and center column.
    *   Place the rotated object within output grid based on calculated center location.
6. **Place the rotated Object** copy the pixel by pixel values of the rotated object into the output grid starting at calculated location.
