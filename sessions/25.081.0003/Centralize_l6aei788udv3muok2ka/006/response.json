            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were a good start, correctly identifying the core concept of object rotation. However, the centering logic is flawed. The code rotates the object correctly but fails to *re-center* it based on the *original* object's center.  It appears to be attempting to center relative to original shape position, not absolute original center, and it isn't correctly handling the shift in dimensions after rotation. The examples clearly show the rotated object should be positioned such that its new center aligns with the center of the *original* object's location.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Centering Logic:** The primary focus is to correct the centering algorithm. The current code calculates a \"new center,\" but it's not working correctly with respect to original object. We need to calculate center of original, then use the *rotated* dimensions to calculate correct offset, relative to original center.\n2.  **Verify Assumptions:** Double-check assumptions about how rotation affects coordinates.\n3. **Update Natural Program**\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual, visual inspection, can be improved with code execution later if needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Object: 3x3 \"2\" (red) block.\n    *   Original Center: (1, 1) (row, col).\n    *   Rotated Object: 3x3 block.\n    *   Expected Output Center (of the rotated object): (1,1)\n    *   Actual Output: it is incorrectly positioned at upper-left. It should be\n        centered.\n    * Error: centering error, as described.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Object: 3x3 block of \"5\" (grey).\n    *   Original Center: (2, 3)\n    *   Rotated Object: 3x3 block.\n    *   Expected Output Center: (2, 3)\n    * Error: same error as 1\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Object: 3x3 block of color \"6\".\n    *    Original Center: (3, 1).\n    *   Rotated object: 3x1 block.\n    *   Expected output center: (3, 1).\n    *    Error: it seems the code rotates the object but places it such that the center of the rotated object aligns with the top-left corner of the original bounding box, rather than its center.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
