facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are always of the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Colors involved are black (0), yellow (4), and red (2).
  - observation: |
      Non-black pixels change their positions between input and output.
  - objects:
      - name: colored_pixel
        properties:
          - color: [yellow, red]
          - position: [row, column]
      - name: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: [height, width]
  - actions:
    - name: swap_positions
      description: |
          Colored pixels exchange their positions based on a yet-to-be-determined rule.
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: |
          The relative positions of colored pixels in the input seem to influence their positions in the output.
    - type: conditional_movement
      description: |
          In example 2, there is no change. The rule seems to depend on initial color and positions
