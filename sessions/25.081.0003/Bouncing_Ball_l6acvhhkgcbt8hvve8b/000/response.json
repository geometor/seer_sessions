The colors present are primarily black (0), yellow (4), and red (2). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The key transformation appears to be a swapping of the positions of colored, non-black pixels, perhaps with some logic related to their original position or color. There's a potential \"mirroring\" or \"flipping\" aspect in some, but not all examples, and one example shows no movement, indicating conditional movement.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

It correctly explains all three examples.\n    *   Example 1: Red (2) is at the bottom, yellow (4) is above it; they swap vertical positions.\n    *   Example 2: Red (2) at bottom, with all yellows (4) above and in a vertical line; no swap.\n    *   Example 3. Red (2) is at the top, Yellow is below it; they swap vertical positions.\n\nThe key insight here is that the swapping is *vertical* and that an exception (no swap) happens when there is only one column and all the yellows are above the red pixel. This explains all examples given.\n"
