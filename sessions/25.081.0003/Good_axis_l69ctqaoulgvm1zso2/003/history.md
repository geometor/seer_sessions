Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and clearly doesn't generalize to the second example. The core issue is that the logic for replacing white pixels with azure is too simplistic and tied to specific column indices and color conditions from the first example. It's not correctly interpreting the relationship between the "control row" (the row with red and azure pixels) and the white columns. The code also makes assumptions about which cells would turn white if azure is present and white otherwise.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** We need to discard assumptions made from the first example that don't hold true for the second.
2.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** The key is to understand how the position of azure and red pixels in the control row *dictates* the transformation of white pixels *above* that row in corresponding columns.
3.  **Generalized Conditions:** Instead of hardcoded column checks, the logic needs to dynamically determine which columns to modify based on the control row.
4.    **Understand interaction between azure and white:** White turns azure above red, except when azure is present, in which case white is removed.
5. **Iterative Refinement:** We'll analyze, adjust the natural language program, regenerate the code, and test against *both* examples (and any future ones) iteratively.

**Metrics Gathering and Evidence:**
I will use numpy to create a report showing the control row in each case

It appears there's a bug in the `find_control_row()` function, it is not returning any output. I will correct and rerun.

The function is still not working as expected. The issue arises because in some rows, there are three colors. Let me revise and test again.

            continue

        is_mostly_red = False
        other_color = 0
        for color in unique_colors:
            if np.count_nonzero(grid[r,:]==color) > 1 and color == 2:
                is_mostly_red = True
            elif np.count_nonzero(grid[r,:]==color) == 1:
                other_color = color

The `find_control_row()` function is still not working. It should find a row that is mostly red, but contains only one other color. The function should work on the input and also be consistent with the expected output. The previous function does not find the correct control row, which is the penultimate row in each case. I will redefine again what the control row is, the re-implement `find_control_row()`.

The control row is the row which has most of the cells with Red color and one cell another color.

        if len(unique_values) != 2:

        red_count = np.count_nonzero(grid[r] == 2)
