Only the last row of the output grid is modified. For each column, traverse the input grid from the first row to the second-to-last row. If a zero is found in the last row of the *output* grid at the current column, replace that zero with the first non-zero value found in the same column, searching from top to bottom in the preceding rows of the input grid. If no non-zero value is found, the zero remains. The other rows of the output grid should remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the last row acts as a base, and non-zero values from the upper rows \"stack\" onto it, filling the zeros column by column, from top to bottom.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each column.\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Iterate through rows from top to second-to-last.\n        for i in range(rows - 1):\n            # Check if the corresponding element in the last row of the output grid is zero.\n            if output_grid[rows - 1, j] == 0:\n                # If zero, replace it with the non-zero value from the current row and column.\n                if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                    output_grid[rows - 1, j] = input_grid[i, j]\n                    break  # Stop searching after the first non-zero value is found.\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
