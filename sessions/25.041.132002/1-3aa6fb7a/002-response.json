The azure cells themselves and other non-adjacent white cells remain unchanged.\"\n\nobservation_summary: |\n  - Input and output grids are of the same dimensions (7x7).\n  - Color 8 (azure) objects are present in the input grid and remain in the same positions and shapes in the output grid.\n  - Color 0 (white) cells are present in the input grid and some of them are transformed to color 1 (blue) in the output grid.\n  - The transformation appears to be localized around the color 8 objects.\n  - Specifically, color 0 cells adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to color 8 cells in the input are changed to color 1 in the output.\n  - Other cells (color 8 and non-adjacent color 0) remain unchanged.\n\ntransformation_rule: \"For each cell in the input grid, if the cell's color is 8 (azure), examine its four neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor cell exists within the grid boundaries and its color is 0 (white), change the color of that neighbor cell to 1 (blue) in the output grid.  Leave all cells with color 8 and any white cells that are not adjacent to color 8 unchanged.\"\n```"

These are the anchor points for the transformation.\n2. **Check Adjacency:** For each azure cell, examine its immediate neighbors in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n3. **Transform White Neighbors:** If a neighbor cell is within the grid boundaries and its color is white (color 0), change the color of this neighbor cell to blue (color 1) in the output grid.\n4. **Maintain Other Cells:** All azure cells and white cells that are not adjacent to azure cells, as well as cells of any other color, remain unchanged from the input grid to the output grid.\n5. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid, initially identical to the input grid. Apply the color changes described in step 3 to this new grid to produce the final output grid.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n"
