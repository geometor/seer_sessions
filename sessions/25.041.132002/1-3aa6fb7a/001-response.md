task_context: "The task involves transforming grid-based puzzles.  The input grids contain blocks of color '8' (azure). The output grids are similar, but with some cells changed to color '1' (blue)."
observations:
  - "Input and output grids are of the same size (7x7)."
  - "Color '8' appears in both input and output grids, forming contiguous blocks."
  - "Color '1' is introduced in the output grid, replacing some '0' cells that are adjacent to blocks of '8'."
  - "In example 1, two blocks of '8's are present in the input."
  - "In the output, for the top block of '8's, a cell to the right is changed to '1'."
  - "For the bottom block of '8's, a cell to the left and below is changed to '1'."
transformation_rule_hypothesis: "For each contiguous block of color '8', identify a specific 'corner' cell that is immediately outside the bounding box of the block and adjacent to it. Change the color of this identified cell to '1'."

  1. Identify all contiguous blocks of color '8' in the input grid. Blocks are defined by 8-connectivity.
  2. For each block of '8's:
     a. Determine the bounding box of the block: find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all cells in the block.
     b. Examine the four corners of this bounding box: (min_row, min_col), (min_row, max_col), (max_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col).
     c. For each corner, check if it meets two conditions:
        i.  The cell at the corner coordinates in the input grid is NOT part of the block of '8's (i.e., its color is not '8').
        ii. The corner cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one cell that is part of the block of '8's.
     d. If a corner cell satisfies both conditions, change the color of that cell in the output grid to '1'.
     e. It is assumed that for each block, there will be exactly one such corner cell. Stop after finding and changing one such cell for each block.
