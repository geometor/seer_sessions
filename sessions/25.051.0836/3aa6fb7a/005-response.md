# 1-3aa6fb7a • 005 • Iteration 1 - CODE

---
Okay, I understand the task and the template. Here's a breakdown of my approach and an example of how I'll structure my response, using a hypothetical simple task.

**Hypothetical Task Example:**

Let's say the task involves input grids where a single blue square (color 1) is always present, and the output grid requires changing that blue square to red (color 2).  All other cells remain unchanged.

**My Response Structure (Example):**

```yaml
observations:
  - input_objects:
    - type: square
      color: blue (1)
      count: 1
      position: varies
  - output_objects:
    - type: square
      color: red (2)
      count: 1
      position: same as input blue square
  - other_notes:
    - All other cells remain the same color between input and output.

transformation_rule: |
  The transformation rule is to locate the single blue square in the input grid and change its color to red in the output grid. All other cells maintain their original colors.  Essentially, we are performing a color substitution on a specific object.

```

```python
"""
The transformation rule is to locate the single blue square in the input grid and change its color to red in the output grid. All other cells maintain their original colors.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    # Find the coordinates of the object with the specified color.
    coords = np.where(grid == color)
    if len(coords[0]) > 0:
       return coords
    else:
       return None

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by changing the blue square to red.
    """
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the coordinates of the blue square (color 1)
    blue_square_coords = find_object(input_grid, 1)
    
    # Check that object was found
    if blue_square_coords is not None:
       # Change the color of the blue square to red (color 2) in the output_grid
       output_grid[blue_square_coords] = 2

    return output_grid
```

**Explanation and Key Points:**

1.  **YAML Block:**
    *   I'll start with a YAML block summarizing my observations. This helps me organize my understanding of the input and output grids.  I'll focus on:
        *   Identifying objects (contiguous regions of the same color).
        *   Counting the occurrences of colors.
        *   Noting any obvious geometric patterns or relationships (size, position, shape).
    *   I will describe general transformation rule in simple terms.

2.  **Python Code:**
    *   **Docstring:**  A concise description of the transformation rule, matching the YAML description.
    *   **`transform(input_grid)` function:** This is the core function.
        *   **Initialization:** It typically starts by creating a copy of the `input_grid` to avoid modifying the original.  `output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)` is a standard practice.
        *   **Object Identification:** I'll use helper functions like `find_object` to locate specific objects based on color.  This makes the code more modular and readable.
        *   **Transformation Logic:**  This part implements the core rule.  In this simple example, it's just changing the color of the identified square.
        *   **Return Value:** The function returns the modified `output_grid`.
    *   **Helper Functions:**  Functions like `find_object` encapsulate common operations.  This makes the main `transform` function cleaner and easier to understand.  It also promotes code reuse.
    *   **NumPy:** I'll use NumPy extensively because it's efficient for working with numerical grids.

**Iterative Approach:**

I understand that this is an iterative process.  My initial code might not be perfect. The key is to:

1.  **Start Simple:**  Begin with the most obvious transformation I can identify.
2.  **Test and Refine:**  Examine the results.  If the output doesn't match the expected output, I'll analyze the errors, update my YAML observations and transformation rule, and modify the code accordingly.  I may need to add more helper functions or handle edge cases.
3.  **Document Everything:** Keep the YAML block and code comments updated to reflect my current understanding of the task.

I'm ready for the first real task!
