All are some variation of an L-shape.\n2.  **Detect the new objects**: we find that three blue pixels are inserted in the output image.\n3.  **Determine insertion rule:** In the output image, a blue pixel appears in the place of an azure pixel with coordinates (x,y) if its neighbor to the right and neighbor to the bottom are not azure. The other azure pixels are not modified.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\nFor each azure pixel in the input image:\n    If it is not neighbor with an azure pixel to the right and bottom, then\n        Change its color to blue.\n```\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nFor each azure pixel in the input image:\n    If it is not neighbor with an azure pixel to the right and bottom, then\n        Change its color to blue.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell is azure (8)\n            if input_grid[i, j] == 8:\n                # Check neighbors (right and bottom)\n                is_right_neighbor_azure = False\n                is_bottom_neighbor_azure = False\n\n                if j + 1 < cols:  #check the right neighbor\n                    if input_grid[i,j+1] == 8:\n                        is_right_neighbor_azure = True\n                if i + 1 < rows:  #check the bottom neighbor\n                    if input_grid[i+1,j] == 8:\n                        is_bottom_neighbor_azure = True\n\n                # Apply the transformation rule: change color to blue (1)\n                if (not is_right_neighbor_azure) and (not is_bottom_neighbor_azure):\n                    output_grid[i, j] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
