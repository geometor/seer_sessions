Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3 cells
  - object_2:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3 cells

output_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)
      size: 3 cells
  - object_2:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (3,4)
      size: 3 cells
  - object_3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
  - object_4:
       color: 1(blue)
       shape: single cell
       position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects, both colored azure (8). One is an L-shaped object in the top-left corner, and the other is a mirrored L-shaped object.
2.  **Detect the new objects**: we find that two blue pixels are inserted in the output image.
3.  **Determine insertion rule:** In the output image, a blue pixel appears in the place of an azure pixel with coordinates (x,y) if its neighbor to the right and neighbor to the bottom are not azure. The other azure pixels are not modified.

**Natural Language Program**
```
For each azure pixel in the input image:
    If it is not neighbor with an azure pixel to the right and bottom, then
        Change its color to blue.
```

```python
"""
For each azure pixel in the input image:
    If it is not neighbor with an azure pixel to the right and bottom, then
        Change its color to blue.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the current cell is azure (8)
            if input_grid[i, j] == 8:
                # Check neighbors (right and bottom)
                is_right_neighbor_azure = False
                is_bottom_neighbor_azure = False

                if j + 1 < cols:  #check the right neighbor
                    if input_grid[i,j+1] == 8:
                        is_right_neighbor_azure = True
                if i + 1 < rows:  #check the bottom neighbor
                    if input_grid[i+1,j] == 8:
                        is_bottom_neighbor_azure = True

                # Apply the transformation rule: change color to blue (1)
                if (not is_right_neighbor_azure) and (not is_bottom_neighbor_azure):
                    output_grid[i, j] = 1

    return output_grid
```

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
