One is an L-shaped object in the top-left corner, and the other is a mirrored L-shaped object.\n2.  **Detect the new objects**: we find that two blue pixels are inserted in the output image.\n3.  **Determine insertion rule:** In the output image, a blue pixel appears in the place of an azure pixel with coordinates (x,y) if its neighbor to the right and neighbor to the bottom are not azure. The other azure pixels are not modified.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\nFor each azure pixel in the input image:\n    If it is not neighbor with an azure pixel to the right and bottom, then\n        Change its color to blue.\n```\n"
