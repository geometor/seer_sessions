If this cell exists within the row boundaries and its value is 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.\n3. **Locate the Last '8':** Identify the index of the last occurrence of the number 8 in the same row, scanning from right to left.\n4. **Modify Left Cell (if applicable):** If an '8' is found, examine the cell immediately to its left within the same row. If this cell exists within the row boundaries and its value is 0, change its value to 1 in the output grid.\n5. **Unchanged Rows:** If no '8' is found in the current row, leave the entire row unchanged in the output grid.\n\nRepeat these steps for every row in the input grid to generate the complete output grid."
