The rest of the grid is filled with white (color 0) pixels.\n\n2.  **Object Persistence:** The L-shaped objects themselves are unchanged. That is their locations and orientation are the same in both the input and output grids.\n\n3. **Color change**: The color blue (value 1) has been placed in one of cells next to each of the persisting azure objects. Specifically, the cell to the immediate right of the topmost azure colored pixel in each object.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe rule preserves the two L-shaped azure objects and adds the color 1 (blue) to the right of the highest point in each object.\n"
