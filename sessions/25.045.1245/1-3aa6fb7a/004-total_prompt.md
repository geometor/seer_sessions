Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions:  [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2),(4,4)]

  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects composed of azure (color 8) pixels. The rest of the grid is filled with white (color 0) pixels.

2.  **Object Persistence:** The L-shaped objects themselves are unchanged. That is their locations and orientation are the same in both the input and output grids.

3. **Color change**: The color blue (value 1) has been placed in one of cells next to each of the persisting azure objects. Specifically, the cell to the immediate right of the topmost azure colored pixel in each object.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**

The rule preserves the two L-shaped azure objects and adds the color 1 (blue) to the right of the highest point in each object.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).  The remaining cells are white (0).

2.  **Object Persistence:** The three L-shaped objects remain in the same locations and orientations in the output grid.

3.  **Color Change:** A blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel of *each* L-shaped object. This aligns with the rule identified in the first example.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**
The transformation rule can be summarized as follows: Locate all azure (8) colored, L-shaped objects. Preserve these objects. Then place a blue pixel(1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel within each identified L-shape.

This is the same rule that has been applied before.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
