Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape (rotated)
      positions:  [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2),(4,4)]

  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct L-shaped objects composed of azure (color 8) pixels. The rest of the grid is filled with white (color 0) pixels.

2.  **Object Persistence:** The L-shaped objects themselves are unchanged. That is their locations and orientation are the same in both the input and output grids.

3. **Color change**: The color blue (value 1) has been placed in one of cells next to each of the persisting azure objects. Specifically, the cell to the immediate right of the topmost azure colored pixel in each object.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**

The rule preserves the two L-shaped azure objects and adds the color 1 (blue) to the right of the highest point in each object.

**Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- Follow the template below
- If your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Transform Template:**

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ allowed imports that support the transform }

def transform(input):
    # initialize output

    # change output pixels 

    return output


if __name__ == '__main__':

    input = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    expected_output = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

    output = transform(input)

    if output == expected_output:
        print("SUCCESS!\n")
    else:
        print("FAILED!\n")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", output)

    print()
    assert output == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."

```
