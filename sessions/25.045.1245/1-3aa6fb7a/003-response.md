Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids in this second example.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(0,4), (0,5), (1,5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,4), (2, 3), (5,3)]
  background:
    color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).  The remaining cells are white (0).

2.  **Object Persistence:** The three L-shaped objects remain in the same locations and orientations in the output grid.

3.  **Color Change:** A blue pixel (color 1) is added to the right of the topmost azure pixel of *each* L-shaped object. This aligns with the rule identified in the first example.

**Summary of the Transformation Rule**
The transformation rule can be summarized as follows: Locate all azure (8) colored, L-shaped objects. Preserve these objects. Then place a blue pixel(1) to the immediate right of the highest azure pixel within each identified L-shape.

This is the same rule that has been applied before.
