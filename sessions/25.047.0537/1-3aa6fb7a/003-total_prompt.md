Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical rectangle on the left, and the other is a 2x1 vertical rectangle on the right.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, *except* that a single blue (color 1) pixel appears to the immediate right of the top cell of each azure object.

**YAML Summary:**



*text:*
```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner coordinates
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner coordinates

transformations:
  - object_index: 0 # the top-left cell of the first object
    new_color: 1 # turns blue
    relative_position: right # immediately to the right of object

  - object_index: 1 # the top-left cell of the second object
    new_color: 1  # turns blue
    relative_position: right
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify all azure (color 8) objects that are 2x1 vertical rectangles.
2.  For each such object, find the cell immediately to the right of its top cell.
3.  Change the color of that cell to blue (color 1).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
