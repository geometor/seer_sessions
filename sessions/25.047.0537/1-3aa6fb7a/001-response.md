Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped structures, one mirrored"
  dimensions: [7, 7]

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: "Two separate L-shaped structures, one mirrored"
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: "Two single cells"
  dimensions: [7, 7]
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects formed by cells of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Preserve Existing:** The azure (8) objects are preserved from the input.

3. **Insert New:** A new color is introduced in the output. For each original azure object, a new blue object (1) is added. The position of the new object is always adjacent to the original. The blue is always in the x+1 of the top-left pixel of the shape.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language)**

The transformation preserves the azure (8) colored L-shaped objects and adds a single blue (1) colored cell adjacent to the right of the top-leftmost cell of each azure L-shape.
