Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule. Here's my approach:

**1. Observation and Fact Gathering**

I will start by carefully observing the input and output grids, noting the objects, their positions, colors, and any changes between the two states. I'll document these observations as facts in a YAML block.


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grid contains two distinct azure (8) colored objects."
  - object_1: "A vertical line of two azure pixels at grid position (1,1) & (2,1) (row, col)."
  - object_2: "A horizontal line of two azure pixels at (3,4) & (3,5)."
  - change_1: "A new white pixel (1) appears between the two azure pixels of object_2 at (4,4)."
  - change_2: No change in color or size for object_1 or object_2
```


**2. Transformation Rule Description**

Based on my observations, I'll formulate a natural language description of the transformation rule, in a concise way.
*   Locate all objects comprised of 2 pixels of color azure (8).
*   For horizontal objects, insert a pixel of color white (1) in the row below the first pixel.

**3. Next Steps**
In the next phase (coder), I would work on crafting the python function to implement the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
