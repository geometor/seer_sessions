            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program describing the transformation.  The previous code and its output show a clear pattern, but also a consistent error. The error arises from inserting the wrong color.\n\nHere's a revised breakdown of the transformation, focusing on correcting the identified issue:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The program searches for objects composed of *exactly two* azure (color code 8) pixels.  These are the only objects of interest.\n\n2.  **Orientation Check:** For each identified two-pixel azure object, determine its orientation.  There are only two possibilities to consider at this stage:\n    *   **Horizontal:** The two azure pixels are adjacent and in the same row.\n    *  **Vertical**\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   **If Horizontal:** Locate the leftmost azure pixel within the two-pixel object. Insert a *blue* (color code 1) pixel directly *below* this leftmost azure pixel.\n    * if Vertical: then it will insert the blue pixel to the right of the bottom most pixel.\n\n4.  **Output:** All other pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. The output is the result of applying the above steps to all two-pixel azure objects in the input.\n\n**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**\n\n*   **Focus on Two-Pixel Objects:** The rule *only* applies to azure objects with exactly two pixels. This is crucial and was correctly implemented in code, it will help the coder.\n*   **Explicit Color Identification:** Added the Color code and color name.\n*    Horizontal and Vertical Identification and action associated\n* **Leftmost, rightmost, and below**:\n\nThis revised natural language program should capture the logic of the transformation accurately and guide the development of a correct Python function.\n"
