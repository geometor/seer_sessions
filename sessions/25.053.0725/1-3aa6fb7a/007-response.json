Transformation Rule Description**\n\nBased on my observations, I will expand the natural language program, refining it and making it more complete and concise based on this second input/output pair.\n\n*   Locate all objects comprised of 2 pixels of color azure (8).\n*   For each horizontal object, insert a pixel of color white (1) in the row below the first pixel.\n*   For each vertical object, insert a pixel of color white(1) in the column after the first pixel.\n* In essence, for *any* two-pixel azure object, insert a white pixel adjacent to the 'first' pixel of the object; below for horizontal, to the right for vertical. \"First\" can mean top-most for vertical and left-most for horizontal.\n\n**3. Next Steps**\n\nIn the next phase (coder), I would update the python function to implement the refined transformation.\n\n"
