Observation and Fact Gathering**\n\nI will start by carefully observing the input and output grids, noting the objects, their positions, colors, and any changes between the two states. I'll document these observations as facts in a YAML block.\n\n"

Transformation Rule Description**\n\nBased on my observations, I'll formulate a natural language description of the transformation rule, in a concise way.\n*   Locate all objects comprised of 2 pixels of color azure (8).\n*   For horizontal objects, insert a pixel of color white (1) in the row below the first pixel.\n\n**3. Next Steps**\nIn the next phase (coder), I would work on crafting the python function to implement the transformation.\n"
