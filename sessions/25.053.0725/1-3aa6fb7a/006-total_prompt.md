Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transformation Rule:

1.  Identify Azure Objects: Scan the input grid and find all distinct objects
    that consist of exactly two azure (8) colored pixels.

2.  Determine Orientation: For each identified two-pixel azure object, determine
    its orientation:
    *   Horizontal: If the two pixels are in the same row and adjacent columns.

3.  Apply Transformation (Conditional):
    *   If Horizontal: Find the leftmost azure pixel in the horizontal object.
        Insert a white (0) pixel directly below this leftmost azure pixel in
        the output grid.
    *   If not horizontal: there is no change to this object

4.  Output: The output grid is the result of applying these transformations to
    the input grid. All other pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program describing the transformation.  The previous code and its output show a clear pattern, but also a consistent error. The error arises from inserting the wrong color.

Here's a revised breakdown of the transformation, focusing on correcting the identified issue:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The program searches for objects composed of *exactly two* azure (color code 8) pixels.  These are the only objects of interest.

2.  **Orientation Check:** For each identified two-pixel azure object, determine its orientation.  There are only two possibilities to consider at this stage:
    *   **Horizontal:** The two azure pixels are adjacent and in the same row.
    *  **Vertical**

3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **If Horizontal:** Locate the leftmost azure pixel within the two-pixel object. Insert a *blue* (color code 1) pixel directly *below* this leftmost azure pixel.
    * if Vertical: then it will insert the blue pixel to the right of the bottom most pixel.

4.  **Output:** All other pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid. The output is the result of applying the above steps to all two-pixel azure objects in the input.

**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**

*   **Focus on Two-Pixel Objects:** The rule *only* applies to azure objects with exactly two pixels. This is crucial and was correctly implemented in code, it will help the coder.
*   **Explicit Color Identification:** Added the Color code and color name.
*    Horizontal and Vertical Identification and action associated
* **Leftmost, rightmost, and below**:

This revised natural language program should capture the logic of the transformation accurately and guide the development of a correct Python function.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
