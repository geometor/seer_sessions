Okay, let's analyze this second example.

**1. Observation and Fact Gathering**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grid contains three distinct azure (8) colored objects."
  - object_1: "A horizontal line of two azure pixels at grid position (0,4) & (0,5) (row, col)."
  - object_2: "A vertical line of two azure pixels at (2,2) & (3,2)."
  - object_3: "A horizontal line of two azure pixels at (6,3) & (6,4)."
  - change_1: "A new white pixel (1) appears between the two azure pixels of object_1 at (1,4)."
  - change_2: "A new white pixel (1) appears between the two azure pixels of object_2 at (2,3)."
  - change_3: "A new white pixel (1) appears between the two azure pixels of object_3 at (5,3)."
```



**2. Transformation Rule Description**

Based on my observations, I will expand the natural language program, refining it and making it more complete and concise based on this second input/output pair.

*   Locate all objects comprised of 2 pixels of color azure (8).
*   For each horizontal object, insert a pixel of color white (1) in the row below the first pixel.
*   For each vertical object, insert a pixel of color white(1) in the column after the first pixel.
* In essence, for *any* two-pixel azure object, insert a white pixel adjacent to the 'first' pixel of the object; below for horizontal, to the right for vertical. "First" can mean top-most for vertical and left-most for horizontal.

**3. Next Steps**

In the next phase (coder), I would update the python function to implement the refined transformation.



```python
"""
Transformation Rule:

1.  Locate all objects comprised of 2 pixels of color azure (8).
2.  For each horizontal object, insert a pixel of color white (1) in the row below the first pixel.
3. For each vertical object, insert a pixel of color white(1) in the column after the first pixel.

    return objects

    # object assumed to have only 2 pixels
    return object_pixels[0][0] == object_pixels[1][0]

    """

    for obj in azure_objects:
      if is_horizontal(obj):

        output_grid[obj[0][0] + 1, obj[0][1]] = 1
      else:

        output_grid[obj[0][0], obj[0][1] + 1] = 1

    return output_grid
