Okay, I'm in the dreamer role, and I need to analyze the provided input and output grids to describe the transformation rule. Here's my analysis and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Observations and Analysis of the Examples and Previous Code Output:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The core objects of interest are those composed of two azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Object Orientation:** These two-pixel azure objects can be oriented either horizontally (side-by-side) or vertically (one above the other). This orientation is crucial to the transformation.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   If a two-pixel azure object is *horizontal*, a white pixel (color 0) is inserted directly *below* the *leftmost* azure pixel.
    *  If an azure object has any orientation other than horizontal, the object is not changed.

4. **Previous Code Errors:**
    - it does not insert the white pixel below the *leftmost* pixel, but instead below whichever pixel happens to be processed first, which is not deterministic
    - It is inserting an azure colored pixel, not a white one.

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step natural language program describing the transformation:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Scan the input grid and find all distinct objects that consist of exactly two azure (8) colored pixels.

2.  **Determine Orientation:** For each identified two-pixel azure object, determine its orientation:
    *   **Horizontal:** If the two pixels are in the same row and adjacent columns.

3.  **Apply Transformation (Conditional):**
    *   **If Horizontal:** Find the leftmost azure pixel in the horizontal object. Insert a white (0) pixel directly below this leftmost azure pixel in the output grid.
    * **If not horizontal:** there is no change to this object

4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these transformations to the input grid. All other pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
