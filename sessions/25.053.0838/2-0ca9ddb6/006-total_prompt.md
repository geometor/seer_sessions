Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example and my plan to figure out the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The input is a 9x9 grid, mostly filled with white pixels (0). There are two single-colored objects present: a red (2) pixel and a blue (1) pixel. The output grid seems to be a modification of the input, with some color changes and additions. New colors introduced are yellow(4) and orange(7). The overall structure (9x9 grid) is maintained. The transformation isn't a simple mirroring or rotation. It appears to be a local operation performed on or around the non-zero pixels, possibly conditional to their surroundings, like an "explosion" from those points.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Clearly define the single-pixel objects in the input (red and blue).
2.  **Analyze Neighborhoods:** Examine the immediate surroundings of these objects in both input and output to discern the transformation logic. Specifically, I need to figure out how yellow pixels are introduced, how they are placed, and how the area around the blue pixel is handled.
3.  **Formulate a Rule:** Based on neighborhood analysis, propose a preliminary rule in plain English, and as a formal program.
4.  **Prepare for Coding:** Gather necessary metrics. Create data structure as YAML block.

**Metrics and Observations (Pre-Code):**

*   **Input Grid Size:** 9x9
*   **Output Grid Size:** 9x9
*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 2 (red), 1 (blue)
*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 2 (red), 1 (blue), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange)
*    The red pixel is at the coordinate (3,2). It appears to be unchanged in location and also flanked above and below by yellow pixels.
*   The blue pixel is at coordinate (6, 6). It appears to become the center of a 3x3 block, mostly filled with orange, except for the blue at the original point.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
input:
  grid_size: [9, 9]
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: [3, 2]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: [6, 6]
      shape: single_pixel

output:
  grid_size: [9, 9]
  objects:
    - color: 2 #red
      position: [3,2]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      positions: [[2, 1],[2,3],[4,1],[4,3]]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 1 # Blue
      position: [6,6]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 7  # Orange
      positions: [[5,6],[6,5],[6,7],[7,6]]
      shape: single_pixel

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Red Pixel Rule:** For every red pixel in the input, keep it as is in output and add yellow pixels directly above and below if those adjacent spots exist within the grid boundary and contains white pixel.

2.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** For every blue pixel in the input, keep it as is in output and change the directly adjacent area, if any, into orange color (above, below, left, right, but *not* diagonals), if those adjacent spots exist within the grid boundary and are white.

**General Assessment:**

The second example follows the same general pattern as the first, reinforcing the rules related to red (2) and blue (1) pixels. Additionally, this example introduces a new color, azure (8), which appears unaffected by the transformation. This confirms the initial hypothesis of a local, color-specific operation. The presence of the azure pixel helps to solidify the idea that only red and blue pixels trigger changes in the output, while other colors remain unchanged.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Existing Rules:** Re-confirm the red and blue pixel rules identified in the first example, ensuring they apply correctly here.
2.  **Incorporate New Color (Azure):**  Observe that the azure pixel remains unchanged, which indicates that the transformation is color-selective.
3.  **Refine Rule (if necessary):**  The rules from the previous analysis should be sufficient, but this example serves as additional validation.
4.   **Document:** Capture observations in the YAML block.
5.   **Provide Natural Language Program**: Describe the transformation precisely.

**Metrics and Observations (Pre-Code):**

*   **Input Grid Size:** 9x9
*   **Output Grid Size:** 9x9
*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 8 (azure)
*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange), 8 (azure)
*   There are two red pixels, located at (2, 6) and (7, 1).  Yellow pixels appear adjacent (above, below and sides) to them in the output.
*   There are two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6). Orange pixels surround them in the output, in orthogonal directions only.
*  The azure (8) pixel at (0,3) remains the same.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Red Pixel Rule:** For every red pixel in the input, maintain its position and color in the output. Additionally, introduce yellow pixels to its immediate, non-diagonal neighbors (above, below, left, and right) if these neighboring positions exist within the grid boundaries and are occupied by white pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** For every blue pixel in the input, maintain its position and color in the output. Additionally, change the color of its immediate, non-diagonal neighbors (above, below, left, and right) to orange if these neighboring positions exist within the grid boundaries and are occupied by white pixels in the input grid.

3.  **Other Colors:** Pixels of any color other than red or blue remain unchanged in their position and color from the input to the output grid.

**General Assessment:**

This example again features red (2) and blue (1) pixels, and their corresponding transformations to yellow (4) and orange (7) respectively, reinforcing the established rules. This example includes a magenta (6) pixel which remains unchanged confirming rule #3. The core logic identified in the previous examples appears to hold, strengthening the hypothesis.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Existing Rules:** Ensure the red and blue pixel rules apply correctly to this new instance.
2.  **Confirm Unchanged Pixel Rule:** Check if the magenta pixel remains unaffected, solidifying the selective nature of the transformation.
3.  **Refine if Needed:**  The existing rules are likely sufficient, but this example provides further confirmation and an opportunity to detect subtle nuances if they exist.
4.   **Document:** Capture observations in the YAML block.
5.   **Provide Natural Language Program**: Describe the transformation precisely.

1.  **Red Pixel Rule:** For every red pixel in the input, maintain its position and color in the output grid. Additionally, if a white pixel exists immediately above, below, to the left, or the right of the red pixel (within the grid boundaries), change that white pixel to yellow in the output grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** For every blue pixel in the input grid, maintain its position and color in the output. If a white pixel exists immediately above, below, left, or right of the blue pixel (within grid boundaries), change that white pixel to orange in the output.

3.  **Other Colors:**  Any pixel in the input grid that is *not* red or blue remains unchanged, keeping its original color and position in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
