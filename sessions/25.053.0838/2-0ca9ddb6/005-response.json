            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example again features red (2) and blue (1) pixels, and their corresponding transformations to yellow (4) and orange (7) respectively, reinforcing the established rules. This example includes a magenta (6) pixel which remains unchanged confirming rule #3. The core logic identified in the previous examples appears to hold, strengthening the hypothesis.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Existing Rules:** Ensure the red and blue pixel rules apply correctly to this new instance.\n2.  **Confirm Unchanged Pixel Rule:** Check if the magenta pixel remains unaffected, solidifying the selective nature of the transformation.\n3.  **Refine if Needed:**  The existing rules are likely sufficient, but this example provides further confirmation and an opportunity to detect subtle nuances if they exist.\n4.   **Document:** Capture observations in the YAML block.\n5.   **Provide Natural Language Program**: Describe the transformation precisely.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Pre-Code):**\n\n*   **Input Grid Size:** 9x9\n*   **Output Grid Size:** 9x9\n*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 6 (magenta)\n*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 6(magenta), 7 (orange)\n*   The red pixel is at (2, 2). Yellow pixels appear orthogonally adjacent to it.\n*   The blue pixel is at (7, 3). Orange pixels appear orthogonally adjacent to it.\n*   The magenta (6) pixel at (5,6) is unchanged\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
