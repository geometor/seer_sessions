            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe second example follows the same general pattern as the first, reinforcing the rules related to red (2) and blue (1) pixels. Additionally, this example introduces a new color, azure (8), which appears unaffected by the transformation. This confirms the initial hypothesis of a local, color-specific operation. The presence of the azure pixel helps to solidify the idea that only red and blue pixels trigger changes in the output, while other colors remain unchanged.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Existing Rules:** Re-confirm the red and blue pixel rules identified in the first example, ensuring they apply correctly here.\n2.  **Incorporate New Color (Azure):**  Observe that the azure pixel remains unchanged, which indicates that the transformation is color-selective.\n3.  **Refine Rule (if necessary):**  The rules from the previous analysis should be sufficient, but this example serves as additional validation.\n4.   **Document:** Capture observations in the YAML block.\n5.   **Provide Natural Language Program**: Describe the transformation precisely.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Pre-Code):**\n\n*   **Input Grid Size:** 9x9\n*   **Output Grid Size:** 9x9\n*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 8 (azure)\n*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange), 8 (azure)\n*   There are two red pixels, located at (2, 6) and (7, 1).  Yellow pixels appear adjacent (above, below and sides) to them in the output.\n*   There are two blue pixels at (3, 2) and (6, 6). Orange pixels surround them in the output, in orthogonal directions only.\n*  The azure (8) pixel at (0,3) remains the same.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
