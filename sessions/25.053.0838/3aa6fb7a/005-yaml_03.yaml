  - objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        type: contiguous_group
        description: Objects composed of one or more azure pixels.
      - color: blue (1)
        type: single_pixel
        description:  A single pixel that results from application of a rule
      - color: white (0)
        type: other
        description:  Background, adjacent pixels considered in the transformation.
  - actions:
      - name: color_pixel
        parameters:
          - color: blue (1)
        conditions:
          - subject: white_pixel
          - relationship: adjacent_to_azure_object
          - logic: |
              Determine relative positioning of each azure object
              Locate white pixel above, below, left, or right of entire object
              Color white cell blue
  - observations:
    - there appears to be a one-to-one mapping between azure colored objects and resulting blue pixel.
    - The position where a new blue pixel is created is based on the position of azure object in the grid
