            "text": "Okay, here's my assessment of the provided input-output example and a plan for figuring out the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe input and output grids are the same size (11x9). The input grid contains a single object made of gray (5) pixels. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, where the gray pixels have been replaced with either azure (8) or red (2) pixels. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the gray pixels within the original object. It appears we might be coloring the shape based on some internal skeleton or medial axis transform.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Clearly identify the gray object in the input grid.\n2.  **Property Analysis:** Analyze properties of the object, such as its bounding box, perimeter, and internal structure, number of rows and number of columns.\n3.  **Color Mapping:** Determine the rule that maps gray pixels to either azure or red. My hypothesis is that the mapping depends on the pixel's position relative to the object's \"skeleton\" or center. Pixels further away from the edges keep color 8, other switch to 2.\n4.  **Natural Language Program:** Formulate a clear, concise natural language description of the transformation.\n5. **Refine with more examples** Use other examples to make the description of the rule more accurate.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\n"
