            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example and my plan to figure out the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe input is a 9x9 grid, mostly filled with white pixels (0). There are two single-colored objects present: a red (2) pixel and a blue (1) pixel. The output grid seems to be a modification of the input, with some color changes and additions. New colors introduced are yellow(4) and orange(7). The overall structure (9x9 grid) is maintained. The transformation isn't a simple mirroring or rotation. It appears to be a local operation performed on or around the non-zero pixels, possibly conditional to their surroundings, like an \"explosion\" from those points.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Clearly define the single-pixel objects in the input (red and blue).\n2.  **Analyze Neighborhoods:** Examine the immediate surroundings of these objects in both input and output to discern the transformation logic. Specifically, I need to figure out how yellow pixels are introduced, how they are placed, and how the area around the blue pixel is handled.\n3.  **Formulate a Rule:** Based on neighborhood analysis, propose a preliminary rule in plain English, and as a formal program.\n4.  **Prepare for Coding:** Gather necessary metrics. Create data structure as YAML block.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Pre-Code):**\n\n*   **Input Grid Size:** 9x9\n*   **Output Grid Size:** 9x9\n*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 2 (red), 1 (blue)\n*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 2 (red), 1 (blue), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange)\n*    The red pixel is at the coordinate (3,2). It appears to be unchanged in location and also flanked above and below by yellow pixels.\n*   The blue pixel is at coordinate (6, 6). It appears to become the center of a 3x3 block, mostly filled with orange, except for the blue at the original point.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
