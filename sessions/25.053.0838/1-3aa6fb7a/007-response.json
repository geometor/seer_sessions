            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the second input-output example, building upon the analysis and code from the first example.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThis example reinforces the core concept observed previously: blue (1) pixels are added adjacent to azure (8) objects. The 7x7 grid size is consistent. The key is to confirm or refine the rule for *where* the blue pixels are placed relative to the azure objects. The previous hypothesis was to use the top-most, left-most available adjacent white pixel.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-use Existing Code:** Utilize the previously developed Python code to identify objects, adjacent pixels, and perform the transformation based on the initial hypothesis.\n2.  **Hypothesis Validation:** Compare the output of the `transform` function (from Example 1) with the provided output grid.\n3.  **Refinement (If Necessary):** If the predicted output doesn't match, analyze the differences to adjust the pixel selection rule within the natural language program and the corresponding Python code. Specifically look for patterns in how the new blue pixels are positioned.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (Python):**\n\nI will execute the existing `transform` function on the new input and compare the results with the new expected output.\n\n*code_execution:*\n"
