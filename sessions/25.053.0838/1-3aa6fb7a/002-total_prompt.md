Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, along with a plan to determine the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The input and output grids are both 7x7. The primary change seems to involve the introduction of the color `1` (blue) in the output grid, specifically adjacent to existing `8` (azure) pixels. The overall shape defined by `8` is preserved. This suggests a rule related to identifying and modifying pixels neighboring specific colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify contiguous blocks of the same color as "objects". In this case, the azure (`8`) pixels form objects.
2.  **Relationship Analysis:** Analyze the spatial relationship between the azure objects and the newly introduced blue (`1`) pixels. The blue pixels appear to be directly adjacent to azure pixels.
3.  **Rule Hypothesis:** Formulate a hypothesis about the rule. A possible initial hypothesis is: "For each azure object, change one of the adjacent white pixels to blue". I need to see other examples to select where the `1`s get placed, maybe they are predictable.
4.  **Metrics Gathering (using Python):** I'll use python code to:
    *   Count the number of azure objects.
    *   Locate the positions of all azure and white pixels.
    *   Determine the adjacency relationships between azure and white pixels.
    *   Quantify the changes (number and location of blue pixels).

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis (Python):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels. Each group is an "azure object".
2.  For each "azure object", find all white (0) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel in the azure object.
3. Locate the white pixel adjacent to the top-most, left-most azure pixel of each azure object.
4.  Change the color of those located white pixels to blue (1).

The most important additional information is in the natural language program at steps 3 & 4. I had to inspect the code output and images to deduce the exact rule for placing the `1` pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
