The rest of the grid is filled with color `0` (white), acting as the background.\n\n2.  **Locate Object Centers:** The transformation seems to depend on the approximate centers of the separated color 8 objects.\n    *   The first azure object has elements at (1,1),(2,1) and (2,2).\n    *   The second azure object has elements at (4,4), (4,5), and (5,4).\n\n3. **Place new object**: The centers are defined by the x and y coordinates that form the original objects.\n   *   The approximate center coordinates of the upper left azure object will be (1, 2) = (1, 1+1) and (5,3) = (4+1, 4-1).\n    *    A new object of color '1' (blue) is placed in each one of these cells.\n\n4.  **Preserve Original Objects:** The original azure objects from the input grid are kept unchanged in the output grid.\n\n5. **Fill the rest**: The remaining part of the grid is filled with color 0.\n\nIn essence, the rule identifies separated azure objects, calculates a type of center to place a blue cell, and preserves the original azure objects.\n"
