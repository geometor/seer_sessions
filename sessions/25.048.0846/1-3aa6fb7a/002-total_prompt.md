Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x2 squares with one cell missing in each of the shapes.
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background

output_grid:
  size: 7x7
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate 2x2 squares with one cell missing in each of the shapes.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (5,3)]
      shape: Single cells
    - color: 0
      positions: All other cells
      shape: Background
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct objects of color `8` (azure). The rest of the grid is filled with color `0` (white), acting as the background.

2.  **Locate Object Centers:** The transformation seems to depend on the approximate centers of the separated color 8 objects.
    *   The first azure object has elements at (1,1),(2,1) and (2,2).
    *   The second azure object has elements at (4,4), (4,5), and (5,4).

3. **Place new object**: The centers are defined by the x and y coordinates that form the original objects.
   *   The approximate center coordinates of the upper left azure object will be (1, 2) = (1, 1+1) and (5,3) = (4+1, 4-1).
    *    A new object of color '1' (blue) is placed in each one of these cells.

4.  **Preserve Original Objects:** The original azure objects from the input grid are kept unchanged in the output grid.

5. **Fill the rest**: The remaining part of the grid is filled with color 0.

In essence, the rule identifies separated azure objects, calculates a type of center to place a blue cell, and preserves the original azure objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
