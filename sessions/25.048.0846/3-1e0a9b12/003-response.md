Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(0, 5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 3), (4, 3)]
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells

output_grid:
  size: 6x6
  objects:
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      positions: [(5, 5)]
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(4, 3), (5,3)]
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      positions: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]
    - color: 7 (orange)
      positions: [(4, 2), (5, 2)]
    - color: 0 (white)
      positions: All other cells
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

1.  **Identify Non-White Objects:** First, we identify all the cells in the input grid that contain a color other than white (0).

2.  **Move Objects to the bottom:** We observe that all the non-white objects are moved down to the last row, if not present, objects are kept in the rows where they already are.

3.  **Preserve Horizontal Order:** The relative horizontal order of these non-white objects is preserved.
    *   Yellow (4) objects, which are leftmost, remain in their original rows and columns,
    *   Orange (7) objects stay in their relative positions and rows,
    * Azure and Maroon Objects are moved to the bottom keeping their relative position

4. **Clear Other Cells:** Any cell not occupied by one of the moved/copied objects in the output is set to white (0).

In essence, this transformation rule involves identifying all non-white objects, moving them to their respective position based on the previous example, and keeping the horizontal order.
