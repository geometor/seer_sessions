            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ninput_grid:\n  size: (3, 7)\n  objects:\n    blue_objects:\n      count: 7\n      positions: [(0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1,6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2,4), (2,6)]\n    gray_objects:\n      count: 3\n      positions:  [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)]\n    white_objects:\n        count: 11\n        positions: all the others\n\noutput_grid:\n  size: (3, 3)\n  objects:\n    red_objects:\n        count: 2\n        positions: [(1,0),(2,2)]\n    white_objects:\n      count: 7\n      positions: all the others\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Description of the Transformation Rule**\n\n1.  **Identify the Center:** The output grid is a 3x3 square. Find the center cell of the input grid. In this case the center of the input is at position (1,3).\n\n2.  **Extract Central Object:** Observe the color number in that center cell. The color number there is 5 (grey).\n\n3.  **Count Blue Objects Adjacent to Center:** Count the number of blue (1) objects adjacent to the center gray object (5) at (1, 3) in the input grid. Adjacent includes cells touching by sides and cells touching by corners.\n\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid filled with white (0) objects.\n\n5.  **Modify Output Based on Blue Count Parity:**\n    *   If the number of adjacent blue objects is *odd*: Place a red (2) object at the intersection of the second row and the first column (1,0), AND place a red object at the intersection of third row and last column (2,2)\n\n    *   If the number of adjacent blue objects is *even*: Place a red object at the intersection of the first row and the second column (0, 1). Place a red object at the intersection of the second row and third column (1,2). Place a red object at the intersection of the third row and the second column (2,1).\n\n**Elaboration and Justification of the Rule**\n\n*   The rule now incorporates a condition to switch between two distinct output patterns based on whether the adjacent blue object count is odd or even.\n*    The positions of red are fixed.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify the Center:** The output grid is a 3x3 square.
