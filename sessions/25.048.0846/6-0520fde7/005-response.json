Find the center cell of the input grid. In this case the center of the input is at position (1,3).\n\n2.  **Extract Central Object:** Observe the color number in that center cell. The color number there is 5 (grey).\n\n3.  **Count Blue Objects Adjacent to Center:** Count the number of blue (1) objects adjacent to the center gray object (5) at (1, 3) in the input grid. Adjacent includes cells touching by sides, cells touching by corners.\n\n4.  **Place Count Value in Center of output:** Create a 3x3 grid filled with white (0) objects.\n\n5. **Modify output:** IF the number of adjacent blue object is an odd number, split the input in 3 horizontal stripes of width 1, centered on the center of the input. Place a red object at the intersection of each stripe and the first column from the left. If the number is even, split the input in 3 vertical stripes of width 1, centered on the center of the input. Place a red object at the intersection of each stripe and the middle line.\n\n**Elaboration and Justification of the Rule**\n\n*   The rule now incorporates a condition to switch between horizontal and vertical stripe processing based on the parity of the adjacent blue object count.\n\n*   When the count is odd, we focus on horizontal stripes and place red objects at the intersection of those stripes, at first column from the left of the 3x3 output.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n1.  **Identify the Center:** The output grid is a 3x3 square.
