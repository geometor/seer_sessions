Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color substitution, incrementing each color value by one:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each with a distinct color (3, 1, and 2) that are arranged one next to each other.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding cell's color in the output grid.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5). Note there must be a circular or modulo operation for this transformation to work with any given number.
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6).

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The shape and position of the objects remain the same; only the colors change. The spatial arrangement and size of colored regions are consistent between the input and output.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this new example.

**Observations in YAML Format**

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 1
      count: 3
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 2
      count: 3
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: vertical line
      position: column 3
      count: 3
```

**Natural Language Program Description**

The transformation rule is a color substitution. However, this time, the increment is not uniform across all colors:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three vertical lines of distinct colors (2, 3, and 8).

2.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6). This is an increment of 4.
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4). This is an increment of 1.
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9). This is an increment of 1.

3.  **Preservation of Structure:** The shape, position, and size of the objects remain consistent between the input and output grids.

**Revised Description**

Based on the previous example and this one, the transformation involves adding a fixed number to each initial color modulo 10. But, it seems that this added number is not always one: it depends on the initial color:

- The program adds 4 to color 2.
- The program adds 1 to colors 1, 3 and 8.


*text:*
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color substitution where each cell's color value in the input grid is incremented by a specific value that depends on the original color. The structure and position of the colored regions remain unchanged.

- If the color is 2, it's incremented by 4.
- If the color is 1, 3, or 8, it's incremented by 1.
- All additions are modulo 10.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
