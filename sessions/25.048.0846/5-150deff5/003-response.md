Okay, let's analyze the second example of transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: Irregular, resembling a distorted "H".
        position: Centered horizontally, slightly above the vertical center.
        size: 15 cells
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Positions where the left neighbor is also gray.
        position: Same positions of the input.
        size: Varies
      - color: 2
        shape: Other positions.
        position: Other positions.
        size: Varies

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify the Object:** In the input grid, there is a single object composed of gray (5) cells.

2.  **Separate Object by Color:** The gray object is divided into azure (8) and red (2) based on a certain rule:

    *   Azure color (8): Assigned to gray positions where the left neighbor is also gray.
    *   Red color (2): Assigned to the remaining gray positions.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The gray object is transformed by assigning azure (8) to cells where the left neighbor is also gray, and red (2) to the other gray cells. This accurately reflects the provided transformation.
