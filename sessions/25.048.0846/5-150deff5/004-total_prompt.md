Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: Irregular, resembling a distorted "E" or Tetris-like shape.
        position: Centered horizontally, slightly above the vertical center.
        size: 15 cells
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Roughly similar to the top portion of the gray object.
        position: Occupies the same top part of the gray shape.
        size: 8 cells
      - color: 2
        shape: Similar to the bottom portion of the object.
        position: The remaining shape becomes 2.
        size: 7 cells

```

**Natural Language Program**
Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify the Object:** In the input grid, there is a single object composed of gray (5) cells. This object is irregular in shape.

2.  **Separate Object by color:** The gray object is divided into azure (8) and red (2) based on a certain rule:
    *   Azure color (8): it is placed on the positions of gray where the left neighbor of that position is also gray and the position is not on the most left side of the shape.
    *   Red color(2): it is placed on the other positions.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The gray object is transformed in a manner that separates cells that have a left neighbor also gray. The separated cells are assigned with different colors (azure and red).

Okay, let's analyze the second example of transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: Irregular, resembling a distorted "H".
        position: Centered horizontally, slightly above the vertical center.
        size: 15 cells
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Positions where the left neighbor is also gray.
        position: Same positions of the input.
        size: Varies
      - color: 2
        shape: Other positions.
        position: Other positions.
        size: Varies

```

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify the Object:** In the input grid, there is a single object composed of gray (5) cells.

2.  **Separate Object by Color:** The gray object is divided into azure (8) and red (2) based on a certain rule:

    *   Azure color (8): Assigned to gray positions where the left neighbor is also gray.
    *   Red color (2): Assigned to the remaining gray positions.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The gray object is transformed by assigning azure (8) to cells where the left neighbor is also gray, and red (2) to the other gray cells. This accurately reflects the provided transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
