Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Description**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 5
        shape: Irregular, resembling a distorted "E" or Tetris-like shape.
        position: Centered horizontally, slightly above the vertical center.
        size: 15 cells
  output_grid:
    objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: Roughly similar to the top portion of the gray object.
        position: Occupies the same top part of the gray shape.
        size: 8 cells
      - color: 2
        shape: Similar to the bottom portion of the object.
        position: The remaining shape becomes 2.
        size: 7 cells

```

**Natural Language Program**
Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify the Object:** In the input grid, there is a single object composed of gray (5) cells. This object is irregular in shape.

2.  **Separate Object by color:** The gray object is divided into azure (8) and red (2) based on a certain rule:
    *   Azure color (8): it is placed on the positions of gray where the left neighbor of that position is also gray and the position is not on the most left side of the shape.
    *   Red color(2): it is placed on the other positions.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The gray object is transformed in a manner that separates cells that have a left neighbor also gray. The separated cells are assigned with different colors (azure and red).
