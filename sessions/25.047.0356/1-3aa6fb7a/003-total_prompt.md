Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains two separate '8' shaped azure objects. One is a 2x1 vertical object on the left, and the other is a 2x2 square object on the right.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that a '1' (blue) pixel appears to the immediate right of the topmost '8' pixel of each azure object.

**YAML Summary:**



*text:*
```yaml
input_objects:
  - color: 8  # Azure
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner coordinates
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2 square
    position: (3,4)

output_objects:
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x1 rectangle
    position: (1,1)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (1,2)
  - color: 8
    shape: 2x2 square
    position: (3,4)
  - color: 1
    shape: 1x1 pixel
    position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is part of an azure ('8') object, check if it's the topmost pixel of that object.
3.  If it is the topmost pixel, change the pixel to its immediate right in the output grid to blue ('1').
4. All the other pixels stay the same.

**Python Implementation:**

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
