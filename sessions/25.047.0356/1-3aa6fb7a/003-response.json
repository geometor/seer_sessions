            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input grid contains three azure ('8') objects.  One is a 2x2 square at the top right, one is a 2x1 vertical object in the middle-left, and the last one is a 2x2 square at the bottom.\n*   **Output:** The output is mostly the same as the input. However, a blue ('1') pixel is added to the right of the topmost azure ('8') pixel *of each object*.\n\n**YAML Summary:**\n\n```yaml\ninput_objects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x2 square\n    position: (0,4)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 vertical rectangle\n    position: (2,2)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x2 square\n    position: (5,3)\n\noutput_objects:\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x2 square\n    position: (0,4)\n  - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1 pixel\n    position: (0,5)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x1 vertical rectangle\n    position: (2,2)\n  - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1 pixel\n    position: (2,3)\n  - color: 8\n    shape: 2x2 square\n    position: (5,3)\n    - color: 1\n    shape: 1x1 pixel\n    position: (5,4)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n2.  Identify contiguous regions of azure ('8') pixels. These are the objects.\n3.  For each identified azure object, find the topmost pixel with the value '8'.\n4.  In the output grid, set the pixel immediately to the right of this topmost '8' pixel to blue ('1').\n5. Copy every other pixel from input to the output\n\nThis program refines the previous one by explicitly stating the need to identify *each* azure object and apply the rule to all of them. The core logic (finding the topmost '8' and placing a '1' to its right) remains consistent.\n"
