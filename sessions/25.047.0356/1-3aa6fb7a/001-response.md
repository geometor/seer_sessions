Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Two separate "L" shapes formed by azure (8) colored pixels.
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
      shape: Same as input, two "L" shapes.
    - color: 1
      positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
      shape: two isolated single pixels
  dimensions: 7x7

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we observe two distinct L-shaped objects composed of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Detect Singularities:**
    The rightmost pixel on the top arm of both "L" shapes are detected.

3. **Color change**: Those isolated azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1).

4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

The transformation identifies the rightmost pixel of the upper arm of each "L" shaped object formed by azure (8) pixels, and turns those pixels to color blue(1). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.
