Okay, here's a natural language program describing the transformation from the input grid to the output grid:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Disconnected Single Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all individual pixels of color 8 that are not directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any other pixel of color 8.

2.  **Change Color:** Change the color of these identified pixels from 8 to 1.

3. **Preserve other pixels** All other pixels remain unchanged.

**Explanation of the Logic**
The core concept is identifying isolated/ singular pixels of value '8'. The program identifies isolated pixels of a certain color and modifies the color.
