**Generate Code**

**NLP:**
['Okay, I\'ve reviewed the provided input and output grids, your proposed natural language program (NLP), and the Python code.  I\'ve also considered the second example you provided. Here\'s a refined analysis and improved NLP:\n\n**Improved Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid to find all pixels with a color value of 8.\n\n2.  **Check for Adjacency:** For *each* pixel found in step 1, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).  Do *not* consider diagonal neighbors.\n\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:** If a pixel with color 8 has *no* adjacent neighbors that *also* have a color value of 8, change its color value to 1.\n\n4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels (those not meeting the criteria in steps 1-3) retain their original color values.\n\n**Key Improvements and Why They Matter:**\n\n*   **"Target Pixels" Explicitly Stated:**  The original NLP implied this, but starting with "Identify Target Pixels" makes the process clearer and more algorithm-like.  We are defining *what* we\'re operating on.\n*   **"For each pixel"**: This phrasing makes it very clear that we are iterating over all the pixels that are equal to \'8\'.\n*   **"Conditional Color Change":**  This more accurately describes the rule. The color change *depends* on the neighborhood check.  It\'s not a simple "find and replace."\n*   **"No Adjacent Neighbors":** This is more precise than "disconnected." It explicitly clarifies the condition for changing the color.\n*   **"Also Have a Color Value of 8":**  Crucially, this emphasizes that we are only concerned with neighbors of the *same* color (8) when determining isolation.  This was a subtle but important detail missing in the original NLP.\n*   **"Preservation":**  This is a concise way to state the final, important rule:  everything else stays the same. This completes the description of the transformation.\n*   **No Diagonal:** Explicitly stating that diagonal is not considered.\n\n**Why this NLP is better than your original:**\n\nYour original NLP was good, but this version is more precise and directly translates into the logic needed for the code. The key improvement is clarifying the *condition* for changing a pixel\'s color.  It\'s not just about being a "single pixel" of color 8, but about having *no neighbors that are also color 8*.  The revised NLP leaves no room for misinterpretation. The second provided example helped in getting this nuance.\n\n**In Summary:**\nThe main point is to identify the single, isolated pixels of colour 8, defined by the fact they are not adjacent to any other colour 8. The program iterates through the pixels, checks neighbors and change the colours of single pixels.\n\n']

================================================================================
**Python Code Instructions**

- Generate a complete Python module to be run in your code_execution to
  represent the natural language program 
- The primary function should be named `transform`, which takes the input grid (represented as a Python list of lists) and returns the transformed output grid (also a Python list of lists).
- Include a docstring at the top of the module that contains the natural language description of the transformation rule.
- Use comments to describe the workflow.
- All major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you.
- Include an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that:
    - Defines the input grid.
    - Defines the expected output grid.
    - Calls the `transform` function with the input grid.
    - Asserts that the transformed output matches the expected output. Print a clear message indicating success or failure.

- if your code fails to achieve a match - analyze the expected and generated
  outputs and try to run the code again 

**Skeleton Template**

```python
\"\"\"

\"\"\"

# Imports (e.g., numpy, sympy)

def transform(input_grid):
    \"\"\"
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule.
    \"\"\"
    # Implementation goes here


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_grid = [
        # ... Input grid data ...
    ]

    expected_output = [
        # ... Expected output grid data ...
    ]

    transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)

    if transformed_grid == expected_output:
        print("Transformation successful!")
    else:
        print("Transformation failed.")
        print("Expected Output:", expected_output)
        print("Transformed Output:", transformed_grid)

    assert transformed_grid == expected_output, "Transformed output does not match expected output."
