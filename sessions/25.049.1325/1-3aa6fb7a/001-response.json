First, identify all distinct groups of connected azure cells in the input grid. For each of these groups, determine its vertical position by calculating the average row index of all cells within the group.  Next, find the middle row of the grid. Compare the average row index of the azure group to this middle row index.\n\nIf the average row index of the azure group is less than the middle row index of the grid (meaning the group is located towards the top of the grid), locate the top-most and then left-most cell within that azure group. Then, change the color of the cell immediately to the right of this top-left cell to blue (color '1').\n\nConversely, if the average row index of the azure group is greater than or equal to the middle row index of the grid (meaning the group is located towards the bottom of the grid), locate the bottom-most and then right-most cell within that azure group. Then, change the color of the cell immediately to the left of this bottom-right cell to blue (color '1').\n\nThis process is applied independently to each connected component of azure cells found in the input grid to produce the output grid."
