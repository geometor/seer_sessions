The remaining pixels are background (color 0).\n\n2.  **Object Persistence:** The azure L shapes do not change.\n\n3. **Blue Pixel Insertion**: For *each* azure 'L' shape, the transformation finds the azure pixel which is closest to the top-left, relative to the other pixels in that object. It places a blue pixel immediately to the *right* of that pixel.\n\n**Elaboration and Edge Cases**\nThe rule successfully changes the correct '8' to a '1'. The core concept relies on identifying the azure objects, their properties, and using a relative positioning rule.\n\n**Summary**\nThe program finds the top-left-most pixel for each connected group of azure pixels and places a blue pixel to its right.\n"
