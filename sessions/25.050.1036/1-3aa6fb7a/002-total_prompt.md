Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes. One in the top-left, and one in the bottom-right
  dimensions: 7x7

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      positions:  [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5,4)]
      shape: Two separate L-shapes. One in the top-left, and one in the bottom-right
    - color: 1 (blue)
      positions: [(1,2), (5,5)]
      shape: single cells
  dimensions: 7x7
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects within the input grid. In this case, we have two distinct L-shaped azure objects.

2.  **Identify Single Azure cells action**:
    *   Locate the uppermost, and then leftmost, azure (8) colored cell of the top L-shaped azure object in the top left corner of the grid.
    *   Locate the leftmost, and then uppermost, azure (8) colored cell of the bottom L-shaped azure object in the bottom right corner of the grid.

3.  **Change Color:** Change color to blue (1) of each of the two azure (8) colored cells identified.

4. **Leave the Rest:** Do nothing to all the rest of the azure and other cells.

In essence, the rule identifies the two azure L-shaped objects and paints the uppermost-leftmost cell blue of the top L-shaped object and the leftmost-uppermost blue of the bottom one.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
