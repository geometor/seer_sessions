## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D0454270460>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D0454271990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid, and possibly some changes in the values. The colors are maintained, although their positions are altered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color
  - operation: rotation
    details: The grid appears to be rotated.
  - observation: positions
    type: change
    details: The positions of the colors within the grid are changed in the output.
  - input:
     grid:
      - row1: [3, 3, 8]
      - row2: [3, 7, 0]
      - row3: [5, 0, 0]
  - output:
     grid:
      - row1: [0, 0, 5]
      - row2: [0, 7, 3]
      - row3: [8, 3, 3]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The values from each cell maintain their identity, so the program is performing a grid rotation without any alteration of original values.

1.  Take original input 3 x 3 grid.
2.  rotate the entire grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
3.  return result


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
