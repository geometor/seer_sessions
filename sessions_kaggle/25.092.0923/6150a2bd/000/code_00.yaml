task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_category: geometric
input_output_properties:
  - relationship: input grid is transformed into the output grid
  - dimension_preservation: input and output grids have the same dimensions (e.g., 3x3 in examples)
  - color_preservation: all colors from the input grid are present in the output grid, and no new colors are introduced.
grid_elements:
  - type: pixels
  - properties: color (integer 0-9)
transformation_details:
  - name: rotation
  - angle: 180 degrees
  - origin: center of the grid
  - scope: applies to the entire input grid structure uniformly
