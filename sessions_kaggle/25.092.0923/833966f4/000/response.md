**Perception:**

The input and output are single columns (1D grids) of colored pixels represented by numbers. In both examples, the input column has a height of 5. The output column also has a height of 5 and contains the same set of colors as the input, but rearranged. Comparing the input and output columns element by element reveals a specific swapping pattern:
*   The element at index 0 in the input moves to index 1 in the output.
*   The element at index 1 in the input moves to index 0 in the output.
*   The element at index 2 remains at index 2.
*   The element at index 3 in the input moves to index 4 in the output.
*   The element at index 4 in the input moves to index 3 in the output.

This pattern holds true for both examples. It appears to be a fixed rearrangement rule for columns of height 5: swap the first pair of elements, keep the middle element, and swap the last pair of elements.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange the elements (pixels) within a single input column based on their position.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (effectively a single column)
  height: 5 (based on examples)
  width: 1
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row index)
transformation:
  type: positional rearrangement
  steps:
    - Identify the input column (list of pixels).
    - Create an output column of the same height (5).
    - Perform the following swaps/copies based on 0-based indexing:
      - Swap the elements at index 0 and index 1.
      - Keep the element at index 2 in the same position.
      - Swap the elements at index 3 and index 4.
  output: The rearranged column.
relationships:
  - The output column is a permutation of the input column.
  - The transformation depends only on the index (position) of the pixels, not their color.
assumptions:
  - The transformation rule observed for height 5 applies to all inputs of height 5.
  - The task might only involve inputs of height 5.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input column (list of pixel values).
2.  Assume the column has exactly 5 elements.
3.  Create a new output column, also with 5 elements, initially empty.
4.  Place the element from the input's second position (index 1) into the output's first position (index 0).
5.  Place the element from the input's first position (index 0) into the output's second position (index 1).
6.  Place the element from the input's third position (index 2) into the output's third position (index 2).
7.  Place the element from the input's fifth position (index 4) into the output's fourth position (index 3).
8.  Place the element from the input's fourth position (index 3) into the output's fifth position (index 4).
9.  Return the completed output column.
