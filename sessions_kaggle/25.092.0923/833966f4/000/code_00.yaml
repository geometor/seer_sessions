task_description: Rearrange the elements (pixels) within a single input column based on their position.
grid_properties:
  dimensionality: 1D (effectively a single column)
  height: 5 (based on examples)
  width: 1
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color (integer 0-9)
      - position (row index)
transformation:
  type: positional rearrangement
  steps:
    - Identify the input column (list of pixels).
    - Create an output column of the same height (5).
    - Perform the following swaps/copies based on 0-based indexing:
      - Swap the elements at index 0 and index 1.
      - Keep the element at index 2 in the same position.
      - Swap the elements at index 3 and index 4.
  output: The rearranged column.
relationships:
  - The output column is a permutation of the input column.
  - The transformation depends only on the index (position) of the pixels, not their color.
assumptions:
  - The transformation rule observed for height 5 applies to all inputs of height 5.
  - The task might only involve inputs of height 5.
