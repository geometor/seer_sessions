The output column also has a height of 5 and contains the same set of colors as the input, but rearranged. Comparing the input and output columns element by element reveals a specific swapping pattern:\n*   The element at index 0 in the input moves to index 1 in the output.\n*   The element at index 1 in the input moves to index 0 in the output.\n*   The element at index 2 remains at index 2.\n*   The element at index 3 in the input moves to index 4 in the output.\n*   The element at index 4 in the input moves to index 3 in the output.\n\nThis pattern holds true for both examples. It appears to be a fixed rearrangement rule for columns of height 5: swap the first pair of elements, keep the middle element, and swap the last pair of elements.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
