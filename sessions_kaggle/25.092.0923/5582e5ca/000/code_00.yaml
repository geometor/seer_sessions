elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid containing pixels of different colors.
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with a single color.
properties:
  - grid_dimensions: The height and width of the grids. They are consistent between input and output for each example pair.
  - pixel_colors: The integer values (0-9) representing colors in the input grid.
  - color_frequencies: The count of occurrences for each distinct color within the input grid.
actions:
  - action: analyze_input
    description: Count the frequency of each color present in the input grid.
  - action: determine_dominant_color
    description: Identify the color(s) that have the highest frequency.
  - action: resolve_ties
    description: If multiple colors share the highest frequency, select the one with the largest numerical value.
  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Generate an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
  - action: fill_output_grid
    description: Populate all cells of the output grid with the determined dominant color (after tie resolution, if necessary).
relationships:
  - The output grid's color is determined by the color frequencies in the input grid.
  - The output grid's dimensions are identical to the input grid's dimensions.
