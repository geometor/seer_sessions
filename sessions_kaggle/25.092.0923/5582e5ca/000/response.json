The output is also a 3x3 grid, but it's monochromatic, meaning all pixels have the same color. The specific color used in the output grid seems related to the colors present in the input grid.\n\nIn each example:\n1.  The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).\n2.  The output grid is filled entirely with a single color.\n3.  This single color appears to be derived from the input grid based on the frequency of colors present. Specifically, it seems to be the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.\n4.  In the first example, there's a tie for the most frequent color (blue=2, azure=8, maroon=9 all appear twice). In this case, the output color is maroon (9), which is the highest numerical value among the tied colors. This suggests a tie-breaking rule based on the color value.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
