task_description: Extract all non-white pixels from the input grid and arrange them horizontally in a single row in the output grid.
input_features:
  - grid_elements:
      - type: background_pixels
        color: white (0)
        distribution: Occupies most of the grid.
      - type: foreground_pixels
        color: Varies per example (orange, red, azure, blue), but only one non-white color per input grid.
        distribution: Scattered within the grid.
        quantity: Varies (1, 3, 4, 2 in the examples).
output_features:
  - grid_structure:
      type: 1D array (single row)
      height: 1
      width: Equal to the count of non-white pixels in the input.
  - grid_elements:
      type: foreground_pixels
      color: Same as the non-white color from the input grid.
      quantity: Same as the count of non-white pixels in the input grid.
      arrangement: Arranged horizontally.
transformation:
  - action: Filter and Reshape
    description: Selects specific pixels based on color and rearranges them into a new shape.
    steps:
      - Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
      - Collect the color values of these non-white pixels.
      - Maintain the order in which these pixels are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and left to right within each row.
      - Construct a new output grid with dimensions 1xN, where N is the total count of non-white pixels found.
      - Place the collected color values into the single row of the output grid, preserving the order established in the previous step.
relationships:
  - The color of the pixels in the output is identical to the non-white color in the input.
  - The number of pixels in the output is equal to the number of non-white pixels in the input.
  - The order of pixels in the output row corresponds to the top-to-bottom, left-to-right scanning order of the non-white pixels in the input grid.
