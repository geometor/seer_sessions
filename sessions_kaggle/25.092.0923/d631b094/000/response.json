The input grids consist primarily of white pixels (color 0) and a small number of pixels of a single other color (e.g., orange, red, azure, blue). The output grid contains only these non-white pixels, arranged horizontally. The number of pixels in the output grid exactly matches the count of non-white pixels in the input grid. The color of the pixels is preserved. The arrangement in the output row appears to follow the standard reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of the non-white pixels as found in the input grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
