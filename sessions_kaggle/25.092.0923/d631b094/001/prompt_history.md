**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a 2D input grid into a 1D output grid (a single row). The input grids consist primarily of white pixels (color 0) and a small number of pixels of a single other color (e.g., orange, red, azure, blue). The output grid contains only these non-white pixels, arranged horizontally. The number of pixels in the output grid exactly matches the count of non-white pixels in the input grid. The color of the pixels is preserved. The arrangement in the output row appears to follow the standard reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) of the non-white pixels as found in the input grid.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Extract all non-white pixels from the input grid and arrange them horizontally in a single row in the output grid.
input_features:
  - grid_elements:
      - type: background_pixels
        color: white (0)
        distribution: Occupies most of the grid.
      - type: foreground_pixels
        color: Varies per example (orange, red, azure, blue), but only one non-white color per input grid.
        distribution: Scattered within the grid.
        quantity: Varies (1, 3, 4, 2 in the examples).
output_features:
  - grid_structure:
      type: 1D array (single row)
      height: 1
      width: Equal to the count of non-white pixels in the input.
  - grid_elements:
      type: foreground_pixels
      color: Same as the non-white color from the input grid.
      quantity: Same as the count of non-white pixels in the input grid.
      arrangement: Arranged horizontally.
transformation:
  - action: Filter and Reshape
    description: Selects specific pixels based on color and rearranges them into a new shape.
    steps:
      - Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).
      - Collect the color values of these non-white pixels.
      - Maintain the order in which these pixels are encountered when scanning the input grid row by row, from top to bottom, and left to right within each row.
      - Construct a new output grid with dimensions 1xN, where N is the total count of non-white pixels found.
      - Place the collected color values into the single row of the output grid, preserving the order established in the previous step.
relationships:
  - The color of the pixels in the output is identical to the non-white color in the input.
  - The number of pixels in the output is equal to the number of non-white pixels in the input.
  - The order of pixels in the output row corresponds to the top-to-bottom, left-to-right scanning order of the non-white pixels in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an empty list to store the colors of the non-white pixels found.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid from the top row to the bottom row.
3.  For each row, iterate through each cell (pixel) from the left column to the right column.
4.  Check the color of the current pixel. If the color is not white (i.e., the value is not 0), add this color value to the end of the list created in step 1.
5.  After scanning the entire input grid, create a new output grid that has 1 row and a number of columns equal to the total number of color values collected in the list.
6.  Populate the single row of the output grid using the color values from the list, in the same order they were added to the list.
