task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2 rows x 6 columns
      rows:
        - description: row_1
          content: monochromatic
          color: color_A (e.g., yellow(4) or green(3))
        - description: row_2
          content: monochromatic
          color: color_B (e.g., azure(8) or maroon(9))
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2 rows x 6 columns (same as input)
      colors_used: [color_A, color_B] (derived from input)
      rows:
        - description: row_1
          content: alternating sequence [color_A, color_B, color_A, color_B, ...]
          start_color: color_A
        - description: row_2
          content: alternating sequence [color_B, color_A, color_B, color_A, ...]
          start_color: color_B
relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have identical dimensions.
  - The set of colors used in the output grid is identical to the set of colors used in the input grid.
  - The pattern in output row 1 starts with the color from input row 1.
  - The pattern in output row 2 starts with the color from input row 2.
  - The patterns in the output rows are inverse alternating sequences of the two input colors.
actions:
  - Identify the color of the first input row (color_A).
  - Identify the color of the second input row (color_B).
  - Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Fill the first row of the output grid by alternating color_A and color_B, starting with color_A.
  - Fill the second row of the output grid by alternating color_B and color_A, starting with color_B.
