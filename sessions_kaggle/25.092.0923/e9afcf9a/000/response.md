Okay, analyzing the provided example pair.

**Perception:**

The input consists of a grid with two rows. Each row is filled entirely with a single, distinct color. The first example uses yellow (4) in the top row and azure (8) in the bottom row. The second example uses green (3) in the top row and maroon (9) in the bottom row. The grid dimensions are 2 rows by 6 columns in both examples.

The output grid retains the same dimensions (2x6) and uses only the two colors present in the corresponding input grid. The key transformation is the rearrangement of colors within each row. In the output, each row becomes an alternating sequence of the two input colors. The first row of the output starts with the color from the first row of the input and alternates with the color from the second row of the input. The second row of the output starts with the color from the second row of the input and alternates with the color from the first row of the input. Essentially, the two rows in the output display inverse alternating patterns of the two input colors.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
components:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2 rows x 6 columns
      rows:
        - description: row_1
          content: monochromatic
          color: color_A (e.g., yellow(4) or green(3))
        - description: row_2
          content: monochromatic
          color: color_B (e.g., azure(8) or maroon(9))
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2 rows x 6 columns (same as input)
      colors_used: [color_A, color_B] (derived from input)
      rows:
        - description: row_1
          content: alternating sequence [color_A, color_B, color_A, color_B, ...]
          start_color: color_A
        - description: row_2
          content: alternating sequence [color_B, color_A, color_B, color_A, ...]
          start_color: color_B
relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have identical dimensions.
  - The set of colors used in the output grid is identical to the set of colors used in the input grid.
  - The pattern in output row 1 starts with the color from input row 1.
  - The pattern in output row 2 starts with the color from input row 2.
  - The patterns in the output rows are inverse alternating sequences of the two input colors.
actions:
  - Identify the color of the first input row (color_A).
  - Identify the color of the second input row (color_B).
  - Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
  - Fill the first row of the output grid by alternating color_A and color_B, starting with color_A.
  - Fill the second row of the output grid by alternating color_B and color_A, starting with color_B.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the color present in the first row of the input grid (let's call it `color1`).
2.  Identify the color present in the second row of the input grid (let's call it `color2`).
3.  Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the input grid.
4.  Create a new output grid with the same height and width as the input grid.
5.  For each column index `j` from 0 to `width - 1`:
    *   If `j` is even (0, 2, 4, ...), set the pixel at `(0, j)` in the output grid to `color1`.
    *   If `j` is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), set the pixel at `(0, j)` in the output grid to `color2`.
6.  For each column index `j` from 0 to `width - 1`:
    *   If `j` is even (0, 2, 4, ...), set the pixel at `(1, j)` in the output grid to `color2`.
    *   If `j` is odd (1, 3, 5, ...), set the pixel at `(1, j)` in the output grid to `color1`.
7.  Return the completed output grid.
