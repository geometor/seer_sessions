            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided example pair.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input consists of a grid with two rows. Each row is filled entirely with a single, distinct color. The first example uses yellow (4) in the top row and azure (8) in the bottom row. The second example uses green (3) in the top row and maroon (9) in the bottom row. The grid dimensions are 2 rows by 6 columns in both examples.\n\nThe output grid retains the same dimensions (2x6) and uses only the two colors present in the corresponding input grid. The key transformation is the rearrangement of colors within each row. In the output, each row becomes an alternating sequence of the two input colors. The first row of the output starts with the color from the first row of the input and alternates with the color from the second row of the input. The second row of the output starts with the color from the second row of the input and alternates with the color from the first row of the input. Essentially, the two rows in the output display inverse alternating patterns of the two input colors.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
