**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4

**output:**
```

**input:**

**output:**

```

Okay, let's break down the transformation process.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. The key elements are:
1.  The number repeated in the first input line.
2.  The number repeated in the second input line.
3.  The count of numbers (length of the sequence) in each input line, which is the same for both lines.

The output also consists of two lines. These lines are generated based on the input elements:
1.  The first output line alternates between the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the first input number.
2.  The second output line alternates between the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the second input number.
3.  The length of the sequences in the output lines is identical to the length of the sequences in the input lines.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num1)
    separator: space
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num2)
    separator: space
    length: L
Output:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: alternating sequence of num1 and num2
    starts_with: num1
    separator: space
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: alternating sequence of num2 and num1
    starts_with: num2
    separator: space
    length: L
Relationship:
  - The unique number from input line 1 (num1) and input line 2 (num2) are used to construct the output.
  - The length (L) of the input sequences determines the length of the output sequences.
  - Output line 1 is formed by alternating num1 and num2, repeated L/2 times (potentially adjusted for odd L, though examples only show even L). The sequence starts with num1.
  - Output line 2 is formed by alternating num2 and num1, repeated L/2 times (potentially adjusted for odd L). The sequence starts with num2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the two input lines. Extract the unique number from the first line (let's call it `num1`) and the unique number from the second line (let's call it `num2`). Determine the count of numbers in either line (let's call it `length`).
2.  **Generate Output Line 1:** Create a sequence of `length` numbers. The number at index `i` (0-based) is `num1` if `i` is even, and `num2` if `i` is odd. Format this sequence as a string with numbers separated by spaces.
3.  **Generate Output Line 2:** Create a sequence of `length` numbers. The number at index `i` (0-based) is `num2` if `i` is even, and `num1` if `i` is odd. Format this sequence as a string with numbers separated by spaces.
4.  **Combine and Output:** Print the first generated string, followed by a newline, then print the second generated string.

Results for code_00.py:

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'

## Example 2:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
**Assessment and Strategy:**

The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a multi-line string, while the execution environment provided a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this type mismatch.

The strategy is to adapt the input processing logic to handle a 2D NumPy array directly. The core transformation logic (alternating the two unique numbers from the input rows) appears sound based on the initial examples and should be preserved, but the output should also be formatted as a NumPy array rather than strings.

**Metrics:**

Since the code failed during input processing, we cannot gather execution-specific metrics. However, based on the provided `train_1` and `train_2` examples:

*   **Input Structure:** Both examples provide a 2x6 NumPy array.
    *   Row 1 contains a single repeated number (`num1`).
    *   Row 2 contains a different single repeated number (`num2`).
*   **Output Structure:** Both examples expect a 2x6 NumPy array as output.
    *   Row 1 alternates `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`.
    *   Row 2 alternates `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: 2D numerical array (NumPy array)
  shape: [2, N] # 2 rows, N columns
  row_1:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num1)
    length: N
  row_2:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num2)
    length: N
  constraints:
    - num1 != num2
    - N > 0
Output:
  type: 2D numerical array (NumPy array)
  shape: [2, N]
  row_1:
    content: alternating sequence of num1 and num2
    starts_with: num1
    length: N
  row_2:
    content: alternating sequence of num2 and num1
    starts_with: num2
    length: N
Relationship:
  - The unique number from input row 1 (num1) and input row 2 (num2) are the building blocks for the output.
  - The number of columns (N) in the input array determines the number of columns in the output array.
  - Output row 1 is generated by placing `num1` at even column indices (0, 2, ...) and `num2` at odd column indices (1, 3, ...).
  - Output row 2 is generated by placing `num2` at even column indices (0, 2, ...) and `num1` at odd column indices (1, 3, ...).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Receive Input:** Accept a 2D NumPy array as input.
2.  **Extract Information:**
    *   Identify the number repeated in the first row (`num1`). This can be taken from the first element of the first row.
    *   Identify the number repeated in the second row (`num2`). This can be taken from the first element of the second row.
    *   Determine the number of columns (`length`) from the shape of the input array.
3.  **Generate Output Row 1:** Create a new 1D array (or list) of size `length`. For each index `i` from 0 to `length - 1`: if `i` is even, place `num1` at this index; if `i` is odd, place `num2` at this index.
4.  **Generate Output Row 2:** Create another new 1D array (or list) of size `length`. For each index `i` from 0 to `length - 1`: if `i` is even, place `num2` at this index; if `i` is odd, place `num1` at this index.
5.  **Construct Output Array:** Combine the two generated 1D arrays into a 2D NumPy array, with the array from step 3 as the first row and the array from step 4 as the second row.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting 2D NumPy array.
