Okay, let's break down the transformation process.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. The key elements are:
1.  The number repeated in the first input line.
2.  The number repeated in the second input line.
3.  The count of numbers (length of the sequence) in each input line, which is the same for both lines.

The output also consists of two lines. These lines are generated based on the input elements:
1.  The first output line alternates between the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the first input number.
2.  The second output line alternates between the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the second input number.
3.  The length of the sequences in the output lines is identical to the length of the sequences in the input lines.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num1)
    separator: space
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num2)
    separator: space
    length: L
Output:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: alternating sequence of num1 and num2
    starts_with: num1
    separator: space
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: alternating sequence of num2 and num1
    starts_with: num2
    separator: space
    length: L
Relationship:
  - The unique number from input line 1 (num1) and input line 2 (num2) are used to construct the output.
  - The length (L) of the input sequences determines the length of the output sequences.
  - Output line 1 is formed by alternating num1 and num2, repeated L/2 times (potentially adjusted for odd L, though examples only show even L). The sequence starts with num1.
  - Output line 2 is formed by alternating num2 and num1, repeated L/2 times (potentially adjusted for odd L). The sequence starts with num2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the two input lines. Extract the unique number from the first line (let's call it `num1`) and the unique number from the second line (let's call it `num2`). Determine the count of numbers in either line (let's call it `length`).
2.  **Generate Output Line 1:** Create a sequence of `length` numbers. The number at index `i` (0-based) is `num1` if `i` is even, and `num2` if `i` is odd. Format this sequence as a string with numbers separated by spaces.
3.  **Generate Output Line 2:** Create a sequence of `length` numbers. The number at index `i` (0-based) is `num2` if `i` is even, and `num1` if `i` is odd. Format this sequence as a string with numbers separated by spaces.
4.  **Combine and Output:** Print the first generated string, followed by a newline, then print the second generated string.
