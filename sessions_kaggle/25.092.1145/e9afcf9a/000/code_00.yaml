Input:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num1)
    separator: space
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num2)
    separator: space
    length: L
Output:
  type: text
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: alternating sequence of num1 and num2
    starts_with: num1
    separator: space
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: alternating sequence of num2 and num1
    starts_with: num2
    separator: space
    length: L
Relationship:
  - The unique number from input line 1 (num1) and input line 2 (num2) are used to construct the output.
  - The length (L) of the input sequences determines the length of the output sequences.
  - Output line 1 is formed by alternating num1 and num2, repeated L/2 times (potentially adjusted for odd L, though examples only show even L). The sequence starts with num1.
  - Output line 2 is formed by alternating num2 and num1, repeated L/2 times (potentially adjusted for odd L). The sequence starts with num2.
