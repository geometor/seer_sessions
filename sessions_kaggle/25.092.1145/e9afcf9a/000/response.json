The key elements are:\n1.  The number repeated in the first input line.\n2.  The number repeated in the second input line.\n3.  The count of numbers (length of the sequence) in each input line, which is the same for both lines.\n\nThe output also consists of two lines. These lines are generated based on the input elements:\n1.  The first output line alternates between the number from the first input line and the number from the second input line, starting with the first input number.\n2.  The second output line alternates between the number from the second input line and the number from the first input line, starting with the second input number.\n3.  The length of the sequences in the output lines is identical to the length of the sequences in the input lines.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Extract the unique number from the first line (let's call it `num1`) and the unique number from the second line (let's call it `num2`). Determine the count of numbers in either line (let's call it `length`).\n2.  **Generate Output Line 1:** Create a sequence of `length` numbers. The number at index `i` (0-based) is `num1` if `i` is even, and `num2` if `i` is odd. Format this sequence as a string with numbers separated by spaces.\n3.  **Generate Output Line 2:** Create a sequence of `length` numbers. The number at index `i` (0-based) is `num2` if `i` is even, and `num1` if `i` is odd. Format this sequence as a string with numbers separated by spaces.\n4.  **Combine and Output:** Print the first generated string, followed by a newline, then print the second generated string."
