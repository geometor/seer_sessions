Input:
  type: 2D numerical array (NumPy array)
  shape: [2, N] # 2 rows, N columns
  row_1:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num1)
    length: N
  row_2:
    content: sequence of identical numbers (num2)
    length: N
  constraints:
    - num1 != num2
    - N > 0
Output:
  type: 2D numerical array (NumPy array)
  shape: [2, N]
  row_1:
    content: alternating sequence of num1 and num2
    starts_with: num1
    length: N
  row_2:
    content: alternating sequence of num2 and num1
    starts_with: num2
    length: N
Relationship:
  - The unique number from input row 1 (num1) and input row 2 (num2) are the building blocks for the output.
  - The number of columns (N) in the input array determines the number of columns in the output array.
  - Output row 1 is generated by placing `num1` at even column indices (0, 2, ...) and `num2` at odd column indices (1, 3, ...).
  - Output row 2 is generated by placing `num2` at even column indices (0, 2, ...) and `num1` at odd column indices (1, 3, ...).
