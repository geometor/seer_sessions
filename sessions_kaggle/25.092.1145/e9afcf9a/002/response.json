            "text": "**Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input was a multi-line string, while the execution environment provided a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this type mismatch.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the input processing logic to handle a 2D NumPy array directly. The core transformation logic (alternating the two unique numbers from the input rows) appears sound based on the initial examples and should be preserved, but the output should also be formatted as a NumPy array rather than strings.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nSince the code failed during input processing, we cannot gather execution-specific metrics. However, based on the provided `train_1` and `train_2` examples:\n\n*   **Input Structure:** Both examples provide a 2x6 NumPy array.\n    *   Row 1 contains a single repeated number (`num1`).\n    *   Row 2 contains a different single repeated number (`num2`).\n*   **Output Structure:** Both examples expect a 2x6 NumPy array as output.\n    *   Row 1 alternates `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`.\n    *   Row 2 alternates `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
