task_elements:
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array (3x3)
      - content: integers (single digits)
      - distinction: contains zero and non-zero values
  - object: OutputSequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: space-separated integers
      - source: derived from non-zero values in InputGrid
  - action: Extraction
    description: Identifying and collecting non-zero integer values from the InputGrid.
  - action: Formatting
    description: Arranging the extracted non-zero integers into a space-separated string.
  - relationship: Input_to_Output
    description: Every non-zero integer present in the InputGrid appears in the OutputSequence exactly once. The number of elements in the OutputSequence equals the count of non-zero elements in the InputGrid.
  - implied_process: Scanning
    description: The InputGrid is likely scanned in a consistent order (e.g., row by row, left to right) to gather the non-zero elements.
