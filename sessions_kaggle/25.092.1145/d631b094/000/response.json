A key feature is the presence of zero (0) and non-zero digits within the grid.\n2.  **Output:** The output is a sequence of single-digit integers, presented as a space-separated string.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve identifying and extracting the non-zero numbers from the input grid. The quantity of numbers in the output corresponds directly to the count of non-zero numbers in the input. The specific non-zero digit(s) from the input are replicated in the output. The examples suggest that the order of extraction might follow a standard reading pattern (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), although this is not definitively proven by the examples since often the non-zero digits are identical.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
