task_description: Reordering elements within a list based on position and specific sorting rules.
input_type: List of integers.
output_type: List of integers.
constraints:
  - Input and output lists have the same length.
  - Based on examples, the length is 5.
  - Elements are conserved between input and output.
objects:
  - name: input_list
    type: List[int]
  - name: output_list
    type: List[int]
  - name: first_pair
    description: Elements at index 0 and 1 of the input list.
  - name: middle_element
    description: Element at index 2 of the input list (assuming length 5).
  - name: last_pair
    description: Elements at index 3 and 4 of the input list (assuming length 5).
actions:
  - action: sort_ascending
    target: first_pair
    result: sorted_first_pair
  - action: keep_unchanged
    target: middle_element
    result: unchanged_middle_element
  - action: sort_descending
    target: last_pair
    result: sorted_last_pair
  - action: concatenate
    elements: [sorted_first_pair, unchanged_middle_element, sorted_last_pair]
    result: output_list
relationships:
  - The output_list is constructed by combining the results of the actions on the segments of the input_list.
