objects:
  - input_grid:
      description: A 2D array representing the initial state.
      properties:
        - dimensions: [rows, columns] (e.g., 3x3 in the examples)
        - elements: Non-negative integers
  - output_grid:
      description: A 2D array representing the final state after transformation.
      properties:
        - dimensions: Identical to input_grid dimensions
        - elements: Non-negative integers derived from input_grid
relationships:
  - transformation: The output_grid is derived from the input_grid.
  - type: Spatial rearrangement.
  - specific_transformation: 180-degree rotation.
  - element_mapping: A cell at position (row `r`, column `c`) in the input_grid corresponds to the cell at position (total_rows - 1 - `r`, total_columns - 1 - `c`) in the output_grid. The value is transferred between these corresponding cells.
