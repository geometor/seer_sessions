In the examples provided, they are 3x3 grids.\n2.  **Content:** The grids contain non-negative integers. The non-zero numbers present in the input grid seem to reappear in the output grid, possibly rearranged. The number of zeros might change or stay the same depending on the rearrangement.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** Observing the positions of the numbers, the transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement. Specifically, comparing the input and output grids in both examples suggests a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   In `train_1`, the top-left `5` moves to the bottom-right, the top-right `2` moves to the bottom-left, and the middle-left `1` moves to the middle-right.\n    *   In `train_2`, the top-left `3` moves to bottom-right, the top-right `8` moves to bottom-left, the middle-left `3` moves to middle-right, the middle-center `7` stays in the middle-center, and the bottom-left `5` moves to top-right.\n    *   This consistent pattern across both examples strongly indicates a 180-degree rotation of the entire grid.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
