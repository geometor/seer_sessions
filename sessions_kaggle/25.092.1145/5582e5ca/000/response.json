            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Perception of Task Elements\n\n1.  **Input:** Each input is a grid of numbers, specifically a 3x3 matrix containing single digits (0-9).\n2.  **Output:** Each output is also a 3x3 grid of numbers. A key observation is that every cell in the output grid contains the *same* single digit.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation involves analyzing the digits within the input grid and determining a single representative digit. This representative digit is then used to fill the entire output grid.\n4.  **Pattern:** By comparing the input digits to the output digit across the examples:\n    *   In `train_1`, the input digits are `6, 8, 9, 1, 8, 1, 9, 4, 9`. The output is `9`. The digit `9` appears 3 times, `8` appears 2 times, `1` appears 2 times, `6` appears once, and `4` appears once. `9` is the most frequent digit.\n    *   In `train_2`, the input digits are `4, 4, 8, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3, 0`. The output is `4`. The digit `4` appears 3 times, `6` appears 2 times, `3` appears 2 times, `8` appears once, and `0` appears once. `4` is the most frequent digit.\n    *   In `train_3`, the input digits are `4, 6, 9, 6, 4, 1, 8, 8, 6`. The output is `6`. The digit `6` appears 3 times, `4` appears 2 times, `8` appears 2 times, `9` appears once, and `1` appears once. `6` is the most frequent digit.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule appears to be: find the digit that occurs most frequently in the input grid, and then create an output grid of the same dimensions filled entirely with that most frequent digit.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"
