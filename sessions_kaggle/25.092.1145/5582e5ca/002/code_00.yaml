task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - is 2-dimensional
      - shape: typically 3x3, but potentially variable
      - dtype: integer (representing digits 0-9)
      - contains a collection of digits
  - object: output_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - is 2-dimensional
      - shape: must match the shape of the input_grid
      - dtype: integer (matching the type of the determined fill digit)
      - all elements contain the same single digit value
  - action: determine_fill_digit
    input: input_grid (numpy.ndarray)
    output: single_digit (integer)
    process:
      - Flatten the input_grid into a 1D array or list of its elements.
      - Count the frequency of each unique digit present in the flattened collection.
      - Identify the digit with the highest frequency. If there's a tie, the examples provided don't specify a tie-breaking rule, but standard methods like `collections.Counter.most_common(1)` implicitly handle it (often by first-encountered or lowest value, depending on implementation details, though not relevant in these examples).
    relationship: This single_digit becomes the value for all elements in the output_grid.
  - action: generate_output
    inputs:
      - single_digit (integer, the determined fill digit)
      - input_shape (tuple, the shape of the input_grid)
    output: output_grid (numpy.ndarray)
    process: Create a new numpy.ndarray with the same shape as the input_grid, where every element is populated with the determined single_digit.
relationships:
  - The output_grid's content is derived from the frequency analysis of the input_grid's elements.
  - The shape (dimensions) of the output_grid is identical to the input_grid.
