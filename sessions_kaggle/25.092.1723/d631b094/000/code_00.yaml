Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Element_Type: Digit (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Cells have positions (row, column)
    - Cells contain integer values
Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Element_Type: Digit (1-9)
  Properties:
    - Order may be significant (though examples don't fully constrain it)
    - Elements are separated by spaces
Transformation:
  Action: Filter and Collect
  Source: Input Grid Cells
  Filter_Condition: Cell value is not equal to 0
  Collection_Rule: Collect the value of all cells that meet the filter condition
  Output_Generation: Form a sequence from the collected non-zero digits
  Cardinality_Rule: The count of each digit (1-9) in the output sequence equals its count in the input grid.
Relationship:
  - Output digits are a subset of input digits (specifically, the non-zero ones).
  - The multiplicity of each non-zero digit is preserved from input to output.
