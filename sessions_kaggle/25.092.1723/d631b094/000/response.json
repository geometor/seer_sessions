The digit '0' acts as a placeholder or background and is ignored in the output generation.\n4.  **Relationship:** The number of times a specific non-zero digit appears in the output sequence exactly matches the number of times that digit appears in the input grid.\n5.  **Order:** The specific order of digits in the output isn't strictly determined by the examples provided (as multiple instances of the same digit occur in train\\_2, train\\_3, and train\\_4). However, a simple and consistent approach would be to read the non-zero digits from the input grid in a standard reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
