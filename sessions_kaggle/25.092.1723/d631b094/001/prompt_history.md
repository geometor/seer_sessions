Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is consistently a 3x3 grid containing single digits (0-9).
2.  **Output:** The output is a sequence of single digits, separated by spaces.
3.  **Key Observation:** The digits appearing in the output are precisely the non-zero digits found in the input grid. The digit '0' acts as a placeholder or background and is ignored in the output generation.
4.  **Relationship:** The number of times a specific non-zero digit appears in the output sequence exactly matches the number of times that digit appears in the input grid.
5.  **Order:** The specific order of digits in the output isn't strictly determined by the examples provided (as multiple instances of the same digit occur in train\_2, train\_3, and train\_4). However, a simple and consistent approach would be to read the non-zero digits from the input grid in a standard reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  Type: Grid
  Dimensions: 3x3
  Element_Type: Digit (0-9)
  Properties:
    - Cells have positions (row, column)
    - Cells contain integer values
Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Element_Type: Digit (1-9)
  Properties:
    - Order may be significant (though examples don't fully constrain it)
    - Elements are separated by spaces
Transformation:
  Action: Filter and Collect
  Source: Input Grid Cells
  Filter_Condition: Cell value is not equal to 0
  Collection_Rule: Collect the value of all cells that meet the filter condition
  Output_Generation: Form a sequence from the collected non-zero digits
  Cardinality_Rule: The count of each digit (1-9) in the output sequence equals its count in the input grid.
Relationship:
  - Output digits are a subset of input digits (specifically, the non-zero ones).
  - The multiplicity of each non-zero digit is preserved from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list to store the output digits.
2.  Iterate through each cell of the input 3x3 grid, processing row by row, and within each row, cell by cell from left to right.
3.  For each cell, check if the digit it contains is non-zero.
4.  If the digit is non-zero, add this digit to the output list.
5.  After iterating through all cells in the grid, format the collected digits in the list into a space-separated string for the final output.
