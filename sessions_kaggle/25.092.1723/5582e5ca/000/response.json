Notably, the output grid consists of only one distinct digit, repeated across all nine cells. This repeated digit in the output appears to be related to the frequency of digits in the input grid. Specifically, the output digit seems to be the digit that appears most often (the mode) in the input grid.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
