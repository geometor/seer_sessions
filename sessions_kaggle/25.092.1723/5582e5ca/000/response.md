## Perception

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The output is also a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Notably, the output grid consists of only one distinct digit, repeated across all nine cells. This repeated digit in the output appears to be related to the frequency of digits in the input grid. Specifically, the output digit seems to be the digit that appears most often (the mode) in the input grid.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    rows: 3
    columns: 3
    cell_type: integer (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    rows: 3
    columns: 3
    cell_type: integer (0-9)
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    range: 0-9

properties:
  - object: input_grid
    property: cells
    value: collection of 9 digits
  - object: digit
    property: frequency
    description: count of occurrences within the input_grid
  - object: output_grid
    property: uniform_value
    description: all cells contain the same digit

actions:
  - name: find_most_frequent_digit
    input: input_grid
    output: digit
    description: Determine the digit that occurs most frequently among all cells in the input grid.
  - name: create_output_grid
    input: digit (most frequent)
    output: output_grid
    description: Generate a 3x3 grid where every cell is filled with the most frequent digit identified from the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    rule: The output grid is uniformly filled with the digit that has the highest frequency in the input grid.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine all the digits present in the 3x3 input grid.
2.  Calculate the frequency of occurrence for each distinct digit (0 through 9) within the input grid.
3.  Identify the digit that has the highest frequency (the mode).
4.  Construct a 3x3 output grid.
5.  Fill every cell of the output grid with the most frequent digit identified in step 3.
