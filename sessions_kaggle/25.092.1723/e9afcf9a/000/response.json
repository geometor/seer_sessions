The length of the sequence is the same for both input lines.\n\nThe output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers of the same length as the input sequences. The output sequences are formed by interleaving the numbers from the two input lines. The first output line starts with the number from the first input line and alternates with the number from the second input line. The second output line starts with the number from the second input line and alternates with the number from the first input line.\n\n## Factual Documentation\n\n"
