Input:
  format: Multiline string
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N1) separated by spaces
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N2) separated by spaces
    length: L
    constraint: N1 != N2
Output:
  format: Multiline string
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: Sequence of alternating N1 and N2, starting with N1
    length: L
    pattern: N1 N2 N1 N2 ...
  line_2:
    content: Sequence of alternating N2 and N1, starting with N2
    length: L
    pattern: N2 N1 N2 N1 ...
Relationship:
  - The output lines are generated by interleaving the unique numbers found in the input lines.
  - The starting number for each output line corresponds to the number found in the respective input line (line 1 starts with N1, line 2 starts with N2).
  - The length of the sequences remains consistent between input and output.
