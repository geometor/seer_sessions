## Perception of Task Elements

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. The two lines use different numbers. The length of the sequence is the same for both input lines.

The output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers of the same length as the input sequences. The output sequences are formed by interleaving the numbers from the two input lines. The first output line starts with the number from the first input line and alternates with the number from the second input line. The second output line starts with the number from the second input line and alternates with the number from the first input line.

## Factual Documentation


```yaml
Input:
  format: Multiline string
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N1) separated by spaces
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N2) separated by spaces
    length: L
    constraint: N1 != N2
Output:
  format: Multiline string
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: Sequence of alternating N1 and N2, starting with N1
    length: L
    pattern: N1 N2 N1 N2 ...
  line_2:
    content: Sequence of alternating N2 and N1, starting with N2
    length: L
    pattern: N2 N1 N2 N1 ...
Relationship:
  - The output lines are generated by interleaving the unique numbers found in the input lines.
  - The starting number for each output line corresponds to the number found in the respective input line (line 1 starts with N1, line 2 starts with N2).
  - The length of the sequences remains consistent between input and output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the two input lines as strings.
2.  Extract the unique number from the first input line (let's call it `num1`).
3.  Extract the unique number from the second input line (let's call it `num2`).
4.  Determine the number of elements in the sequence from either input line (let's call it `length`).
5.  Generate the first output sequence by creating a list of `length` elements, alternating between `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`.
6.  Generate the second output sequence by creating a list of `length` elements, alternating between `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`.
7.  Format the first output sequence as a space-separated string.
8.  Format the second output sequence as a space-separated string.
9.  Combine the two formatted output strings, separated by a newline, to produce the final output.
