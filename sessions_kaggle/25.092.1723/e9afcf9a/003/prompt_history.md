## Perception of Task Elements

The input consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of identical numbers separated by spaces. The two lines use different numbers. The length of the sequence is the same for both input lines.

The output also consists of two lines, each containing a sequence of numbers of the same length as the input sequences. The output sequences are formed by interleaving the numbers from the two input lines. The first output line starts with the number from the first input line and alternates with the number from the second input line. The second output line starts with the number from the second input line and alternates with the number from the first input line.

```yaml
Input:
  format: Multiline string
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N1) separated by spaces
    length: L
  line_2:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N2) separated by spaces
    length: L
    constraint: N1 != N2
Output:
  format: Multiline string
  lines: 2
  line_1:
    content: Sequence of alternating N1 and N2, starting with N1
    length: L
    pattern: N1 N2 N1 N2 ...
  line_2:
    content: Sequence of alternating N2 and N1, starting with N2
    length: L
    pattern: N2 N1 N2 N1 ...
Relationship:
  - The output lines are generated by interleaving the unique numbers found in the input lines.
  - The starting number for each output line corresponds to the number found in the respective input line (line 1 starts with N1, line 2 starts with N2).
  - The length of the sequences remains consistent between input and output.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the two input lines as strings.
2.  Extract the unique number from the first input line (let's call it `num1`).
3.  Extract the unique number from the second input line (let's call it `num2`).
4.  Determine the number of elements in the sequence from either input line (let's call it `length`).
5.  Generate the first output sequence by creating a list of `length` elements, alternating between `num1` and `num2`, starting with `num1`.
6.  Generate the second output sequence by creating a list of `length` elements, alternating between `num2` and `num1`, starting with `num2`.
7.  Format the first output sequence as a space-separated string.
8.  Format the second output sequence as a space-separated string.
9.  Combine the two formatted output strings, separated by a newline, to produce the final output.

## Example 1:

## General Assessment

The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, not the expected string format. The previous analysis correctly identified the *logic* of the transformation (interleaving numbers from two rows), but failed to recognize the *data structure* used for input and potentially output.

The strategy is to revise the understanding of the input/output format to be NumPy arrays and adapt the natural language program and subsequent code implementation accordingly. The core interleaving logic remains valid.

## Metrics Gathering

Based on the error and the typical structure of these tasks:

*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Input Shape:** Based on the examples `(2, 6)`, generally `(2, L)` where L is the number of columns.
*   **Input `dtype`:** Likely integer (`int`).
*   **Output Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Output Shape:** Should match the input shape, `(2, L)`.
*   **Output `dtype`:** Should match the input `dtype`, likely `int`.

Let's verify the structure using the provided examples:

**Train 1:**
*   Input: `[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]` -> Shape `(2, 6)`, dtype `int`.
*   Output: `[[4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8], [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4]]` -> Shape `(2, 6)`, dtype `int`.

**Train 2:**
*   Input: `[[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]` -> Shape `(2, 6)`, dtype `int`.
*   Output: `[[3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9], [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3]]` -> Shape `(2, 6)`, dtype `int`.

The assumptions hold for the provided training examples. The transformation operates on 2D NumPy arrays of integers.

```yaml
Input:
  format: numpy.ndarray
  shape: [2, L]  # Two rows, L columns
  dtype: int
  row_1:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N1)
    length: L
  row_2:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N2)
    length: L
    constraint: N1 != N2
Output:
  format: numpy.ndarray
  shape: [2, L] # Two rows, L columns
  dtype: int
  row_1:
    content: Sequence of alternating N1 and N2, starting with N1
    length: L
    pattern: [N1, N2, N1, N2, ...]
  row_2:
    content: Sequence of alternating N2 and N1, starting with N2
    length: L
    pattern: [N2, N1, N2, N1, ...]
Relationship:
  - The input is a 2xL NumPy array containing two distinct numbers, N1 in the first row and N2 in the second.
  - The output is a 2xL NumPy array.
  - The first output row is generated by interleaving N1 and N2, starting with N1.
  - The second output row is generated by interleaving N2 and N1, starting with N2.
  - The dimensions and data type of the output array match the input array.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a 2D NumPy array (let's call it `input_array`).
2.  Verify the input array has exactly 2 rows.
3.  Extract the unique number from the first row (e.g., `num1 = input_array[0, 0]`).
4.  Extract the unique number from the second row (e.g., `num2 = input_array[1, 0]`).
5.  Determine the number of columns from the input array's shape (let's call it `num_cols = input_array.shape[1]`).
6.  Create a new NumPy array (let's call it `output_array`) with the same shape and data type as the `input_array`, initialized perhaps with zeros or empty.
7.  Populate the first row (`output_array[0]`) of the `output_array`: For each column index `j` from 0 to `num_cols - 1`, set the element `output_array[0, j]` to `num1` if `j` is even, and `num2` if `j` is odd.
8.  Populate the second row (`output_array[1]`) of the `output_array`: For each column index `j` from 0 to `num_cols - 1`, set the element `output_array[1, j]` to `num2` if `j` is even, and `num1` if `j` is odd.
9.  Return the `output_array`.
