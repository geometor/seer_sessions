Input:
  format: numpy.ndarray
  shape: [2, L]  # Two rows, L columns
  dtype: int
  row_1:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N1)
    length: L
  row_2:
    content: Sequence of identical numbers (N2)
    length: L
    constraint: N1 != N2
Output:
  format: numpy.ndarray
  shape: [2, L] # Two rows, L columns
  dtype: int
  row_1:
    content: Sequence of alternating N1 and N2, starting with N1
    length: L
    pattern: [N1, N2, N1, N2, ...]
  row_2:
    content: Sequence of alternating N2 and N1, starting with N2
    length: L
    pattern: [N2, N1, N2, N1, ...]
Relationship:
  - The input is a 2xL NumPy array containing two distinct numbers, N1 in the first row and N2 in the second.
  - The output is a 2xL NumPy array.
  - The first output row is generated by interleaving N1 and N2, starting with N1.
  - The second output row is generated by interleaving N2 and N1, starting with N2.
  - The dimensions and data type of the output array match the input array.
