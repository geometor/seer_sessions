*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both lists of single-digit integers.
    *   The number of elements in the input list is the same as in the output list.
    *   The elements themselves are identical between input and output, but their order has changed.
    *   Comparing the input and output lists, it appears that adjacent elements are swapped in pairs.
    *   For example, in `train_1`, the first pair `(9, 0)` becomes `(0, 9)`, and the second pair `(6, 8)` becomes `(8, 6)`. The middle element `1` remains in its position relative to the pairs.
    *   Similarly, in `train_2`, the first pair `(4, 3)` becomes `(3, 4)`, and the second pair `(2, 8)` becomes `(8, 2)`. The middle element `6` remains in its position.
    *   This pattern suggests iterating through the list and swapping elements at indices `i` and `i+1` for `i = 0, 2, 4, ...`. If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element is not part of a pair and remains in place.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_list`.
    2.  Iterate through the `input_list` using an index `i`, starting at 0 and incrementing by 2 in each step.
    3.  Check if the next index, `i + 1`, is within the bounds of the `input_list`.
    4.  If `i + 1` is within bounds:
        a.  Append the element from `input_list` at index `i + 1` to the `output_list`.
        b.  Append the element from `input_list` at index `i` to the `output_list`.
    5.  If `i + 1` is *not* within bounds (meaning `i` is the index of the last element in an odd-length list):
        a.  Append the element from `input_list` at index `i` to the `output_list`.
    6.  Return the `output_list`.
