The middle element `1` remains in its position relative to the pairs.\n    *   Similarly, in `train_2`, the first pair `(4, 3)` becomes `(3, 4)`, and the second pair `(2, 8)` becomes `(8, 2)`. The middle element `6` remains in its position.\n    *   This pattern suggests iterating through the list and swapping elements at indices `i` and `i+1` for `i = 0, 2, 4, ...`. If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element is not part of a pair and remains in place.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
