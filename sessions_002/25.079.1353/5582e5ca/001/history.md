## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
6 8 9

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```


## train_3

**input:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the transformation logic and express it in a structured way:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Each input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Output:** Each output is also a 3x3 grid, but all cells have the same value (and thus, the same color).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve selecting a single digit/color from the input grid and using it to populate the entire output grid. The key is to figure out *which* digit is selected. It is not the minimum, maximum, mean or medium, mode or any other single feature of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
output:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  property: all cells have the same value
transformation:
  type: selection and replication
  selection_criteria: "digit in the middle column and last row of input"
  replication: selected digit populates all cells of the output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Selection:** Examine the input grid. Find the digit located in the center of the bottom row (last row, middle column).
2.  **Replicate:** Create a new 3x3 grid. Fill every cell of this new grid with the digit identified in step 1.
3.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

In simpler terms: The output grid is filled entirely with the color of the bottom-middle cell of the input grid.
