The surrounding zeros in the input grid seem to act as a frame or background, and the key color is always in the non-zero pixels. The output grid's dimensions and number of the key color pixels relate to how often the key color appears on the edges of the \"inner\" shape, not just isolated instances within the input grid.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"

This is the \"key color\".\n2. **Count Key Colors:** Count, for the non zero colors, how many are present in each row and column.\n3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new output grid. The key color will fill a new grid of M x N where M is the number of non-zero colors in the rows and N is the number of non-zero colors in the columns.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule isolates the non-zero colored object, and the size of the output corresponds to the occurrences of non-zero color in each row and column.\n"
