facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3 and contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: The output grid's size and arrangement of color pixels corresponds to number of non-zero colors from each row and column of the input.
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (same as non-zero value in input_grid)
  - action: extract_color
    description: Identify the non-zero color in the input grid.
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: Create a new grid with dimensions and pixel arrangement determined from the count of non-zero colors found from each row and column of input grid.
  - relationship: output_grid dimensions are based on non-zero color counts in input_grid rows and columns.
