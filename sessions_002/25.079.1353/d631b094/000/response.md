Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The task involves extracting a specific color from the input grid and reconstructing a new output grid based on the occurrences of that color. The surrounding zeros in the input grid seem to act as a frame or background, and the key color is always in the non-zero pixels. The output grid's dimensions and number of the key color pixels relate to how often the key color appears on the edges of the "inner" shape, not just isolated instances within the input grid.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3 and contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: The output grid's size and arrangement of color pixels corresponds to number of non-zero colors from each row and column of the input.
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (same as non-zero value in input_grid)
  - action: extract_color
    description: Identify the non-zero color in the input grid.
  - action: reconstruct_grid
    description: Create a new grid with dimensions and pixel arrangement determined from the count of non-zero colors found from each row and column of input grid.
  - relationship: output_grid dimensions are based on non-zero color counts in input_grid rows and columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Color:** Find the single non-zero color value within the input grid. This is the "key color".
2. **Count Key Colors:** Count, for the non zero colors, how many are present in each row and column.
3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new output grid. The key color will fill a new grid of M x N where M is the number of non-zero colors in the rows and N is the number of non-zero colors in the columns.

Essentially, the transformation rule isolates the non-zero colored object, and the size of the output corresponds to the occurrences of non-zero color in each row and column.
