facts:
  - description: The input grid is transformed into an output grid.
  - property: Input and output grids can have different dimensions.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
  - index_transformation: |
      The new x-coordinate (x') is calculated as the original input's height minus 1 minus the original y-coordinate.
      The new y-coordinate (y') is the same as the original x-coordinate.
