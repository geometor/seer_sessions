            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program described a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.  However, the test results show a consistent mismatch between the expected and transformed outputs. The `pixels_off` metric being 6 in both cases, with correct size, color palette, and pixel counts, strongly suggests the *direction* or *type* of rotation is incorrect. It's likely a different kind of rotation or reflection. The code implements `output_grid[cols - 1 - y, x] = input_grid[x, y]`. We need to figure out what it *should* be.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Visual Inspection:** Carefully re-examine the input, expected output, and transformed output images for *both* examples. Look for visual patterns of how pixels are moving. This will help develop an intution for the transformation.\n2. **Coordinate Mapping:** For each example, pick a few specific pixels (e.g., the corners, a distinct colored pixel) and track their coordinates:\n   - Original Input (x, y)\n   - Expected Output (x', y')\n   - Transformed Output (x'', y'')\n   This will help us deduce the correct mathematical relationship between (x, y) and (x', y').\n3. **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the visual inspection and coordinate mapping, revise the natural language program to describe the *actual* transformation.\n4. **Code Idea:** Develop a concise description of the transformation that can be incorporated into the comment block of the python function.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, no code execution needed for this step):**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
