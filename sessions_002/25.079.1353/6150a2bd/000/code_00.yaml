facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Values within the grids are single-digit integers, representing colors.
  - observation: The transformation rearranges the values/colors between the input and output.
  - observation: The spatial relationship of the numbers change from the input to the output
  - hypothesis: The transformation is a rotation or reflection of the grid.
  - hypothesis: The numbers are being sorted into the final row.
  - observation: In train\_1, input[0,0] which is 3 becomes output[2,2] which is 3.
  - observation: In train\_1, input[0,1] which is 3, becomes output[2,1] which is also 3.
  - observation: In train\_1, input[0,2] which is 8, becomes output[2,0] which is 8.
  - observation: In train\_2, input[0,0] which is 5, becomes output[2,1] which is also 5.
  - observation: In train\_2, input[0,1] which is 5, becomes output[2,2] which is also 5.
