Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are both grids of single-digit integers, likely representing colors.\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (e.g., 3x3 in the first example, and 3x3 in the second).\n*   The numbers/colors in the input grid seem to be rearranged in the output grid.\n*   The transformation appears to involve a rotation or reflection, as the spatial relationships between the numbers change.\n*    It might involve sorting since the bottom row in the output always appears to feature the larger numbers.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
