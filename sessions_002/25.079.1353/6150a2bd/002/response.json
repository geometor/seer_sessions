However, the test results show this is incorrect for both examples. The generated outputs are not simple rotations. The pixel counts and color palettes are correct, meaning the code is moving pixels *somewhere*, but the placement logic is flawed. We need to re-examine the relationship between input and output pixel positions. The strategy is to carefully analyze the pixel movements in each example and deduce a new, more accurate transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nI need to determine exactly how each pixel in the input maps to a pixel in the output. I'll do this for both examples. Because numpy arrays are easier to work with programmatically, I'll represent the input and output as such, then look at differences.\n\n"
