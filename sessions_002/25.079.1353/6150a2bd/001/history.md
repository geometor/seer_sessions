## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both grids of single-digit integers, likely representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (e.g., 3x3 in the first example, and 3x3 in the second).
*   The numbers/colors in the input grid seem to be rearranged in the output grid.
*   The transformation appears to involve a rotation or reflection, as the spatial relationships between the numbers change.
*    It might involve sorting since the bottom row in the output always appears to feature the larger numbers.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Values within the grids are single-digit integers, representing colors.
  - observation: The transformation rearranges the values/colors between the input and output.
  - observation: The spatial relationship of the numbers change from the input to the output
  - hypothesis: The transformation is a rotation or reflection of the grid.
  - hypothesis: The numbers are being sorted into the final row.
  - observation: In train\_1, input[0,0] which is 3 becomes output[2,2] which is 3.
  - observation: In train\_1, input[0,1] which is 3, becomes output[2,1] which is also 3.
  - observation: In train\_1, input[0,2] which is 8, becomes output[2,0] which is 8.
  - observation: In train\_2, input[0,0] which is 5, becomes output[2,1] which is also 5.
  - observation: In train\_2, input[0,1] which is 5, becomes output[2,2] which is also 5.
    
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Another way to describe it, imagine the grid is two-dimensional array. cell \[x, y] becomes cell \[width - 1 - y, x].
