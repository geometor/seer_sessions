The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grids seem to have a common pattern: a 3x3 grid with a single non-zero color value surrounded by zeros. The output grids are smaller, containing only the non-zero color from the input, repeated a number of times. The number of repetitions seems to correspond with the number of time the color appears in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
