facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids are smaller than input grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain a single non-zero color surrounded by zeros.
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: The non-zero color in the output is repeated.
  - relationship: The number of times the non-zero color is repeated in the output grid seems proportional to the number of the color's occurrences in the input.
  - object: input_grid (3x3 array of integers)
  - object: output_grid (array of integers)
  - property: color (represented by integers 0-9)
  - property: repetition_count (number of times the non-zero color appears in output)
  - action: extract_non_zero_color (find the single non-zero value in the input)
  - action: repeat_color (create the output by repeating the color)
