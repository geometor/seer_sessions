## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (same height and width) between input and output.  The core transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows, potentially involving a reversal of both row order and element order within each row.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
    properties:
      - dimensions: height and width remain constant.
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9, representing colors).

  - type: transformation
    description: Rearrangement of rows and elements within rows.
    properties:
      - row_order:  Reversed.
      - element_order: Reversed within each row.

  - type: observation
    description: combined row and element reversal are equivalent to 180 degree rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Reverse the order of the rows in the grid.
3.  For each row in the newly ordered grid, reverse the order of the elements (integers) within that row.
4.  Output the resulting grid.

Alternative, and simpler, natural language program:

1. Read the input grid
2. Rotate the input 180 degrees
3. Output the resulting grid.
