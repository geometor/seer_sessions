facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
  - description: Input grid is transformed into output grid.
  - relation: dimensions are preserved and the input values are transposed, swapping rows and columns.
  - objects:
      - object1: input_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: 3x3, 2x3
          - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - object2: output_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: same as input_grid for each pair.
          - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
        relation: values are a transposition of input_grid's elements
