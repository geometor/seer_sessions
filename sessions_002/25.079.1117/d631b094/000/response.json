The output grid's dimensions and content seem to depend on the non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. The zero-value pixels (white) appear to be background and are ignored.  The color of the non-zero pixels in the input becomes the color of all pixels in the output. The quantity of non-zero pixels in input seems related to output grid size.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
