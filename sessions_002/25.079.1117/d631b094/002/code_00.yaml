facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of different colors (represented by integers 0-9).
      Only one color, other than white (0), appears in each input grid.
      The number of non-white pixels determines the size and shape of the output grid.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - scanned: for non-zero pixels
  - object: NonZeroPixels
    properties:
      - count: integer (number of non-zero pixels)
      - color: integer (the color value of all non-zero pixels)
    actions:
      - counted: to determine the output grid dimensions
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: determined by NonZeroPixels.count
      - values: all cells filled with NonZeroPixels.color
    actions:
      - constructed: based on NonZeroPixels properties
  - transformation_rule: |
      The output grid is constructed based on the number of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
      All cells in the output grid have the same color as the non-zero pixels in the input.
      It seems that if the count is a perfect square, the output is a square matrix
