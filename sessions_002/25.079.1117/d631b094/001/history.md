Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller, rectangular grid. The output grid's dimensions and content seem to depend on the non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. The zero-value pixels (white) appear to be background and are ignored.  The color of the non-zero pixels in the input becomes the color of all pixels in the output. The quantity of non-zero pixels in input seems related to output grid size.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels (represented by digits 0-9)
      background_color: 0 (white)
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable (dependent on input)
      elements: pixels (same color as non-zero input pixels)
  - type: non_zero_pixels
    properties:
        color: variable, same in one input grid

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero_pixels
    description: Identify and isolate pixels in the input grid with values other than 0.
  - name: determine_output_dimensions
    description: Calculate the size of the output grid based on number of non-zero input pixels.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create output grid of calculated dimension, using the non-zero color.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_non_zero_pixels: Input grid contains non-zero pixels.
  - non_zero_pixels_to_output_grid_color: The color of the non-zero pixels determines the color of all pixels in the output grid.
  - non_zero_pixels_count_to_output_dimensions: The number of non-zero pixels in the input grid influences the dimensions of the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and find all pixels with a value other than 0 (white). Note the color of these non-zero pixels; all will have the same color in these examples.

2. **Count Non-Zero Pixels:** Count the number of non-zero pixels found in the previous step.

3. **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    - If the count is 1, the output grid is 1x1.
    - If the count is 2, the output grid is 1x2.
    - If the count is 3, the output grid is 1x3.
    - if the count is 4, the output is 2x2

4. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the dimensions determined in step 3. Fill all cells of this new grid with the color of the non-zero pixels identified in step 1.

5. **Return Output:** present the new grid created in last step.
