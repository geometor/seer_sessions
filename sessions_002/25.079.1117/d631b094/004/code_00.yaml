facts:
  - description: "Non-zero pixels in the input grid determine the output."
  - property: "All non-zero pixels within a single example share the same color."
  - observation: |
      The number of non-zero pixels in the input corresponds to the number of
      pixels in the output.
  - rule_1: "If there is 1 non-zero pixel, the output is a 1x1 grid."
  - rule_2: "If there are 2 non-zero pixels, the output is a 1x2 grid."
  - rule_3: "If there are 3 non-zero pixels, the output is a 1x3 grid."
  - rule_4: "If there are 4 non-zero pixels, the output is a 2x2 grid."
  - output_color: "The output grid is filled entirely with the color of the input's non-zero pixels."
