The mismatches in both examples 1 and 2, evidenced by the `match: False` and `pixels_off: 6` results, clearly indicate that the transformation is more complex than initially hypothesized. The \"pixels_off\" metric is particularly useful. The strategy should shift from simply refining the existing transpose-and-reverse approach to re-evaluating the entire transformation process by a careful examination of the input and expected output pairs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's examine each example closely, noting the changes in pixel positions and colors.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input:\n        "
