## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task and provide my observations. Here's my breakdown of the example input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex image processing or external knowledge. It appears to be a rearrangement or permutation of the input grid's elements, potentially based on their values or positions. The colors themselves don't have inherent meaning beyond their numerical values.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - dimensions: rows x columns
        - values: color codes

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_dimensions: 3x3
      output_dimensions: 3x3
      input_values: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
      output_values: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
  - example_2:
      input_dimensions: 3x3
      output_dimensions: 3x3
      input_values: [[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
      output_values: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]

actions:
  - transpose: The transformation seems similar to a matrix transpose with adjusted element order.
  - reverse: After transposing, reverse the order of columns

relationships:
  - input_output:  Element positions are rearranged systematically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Transpose:** Treat the input grid as a matrix and perform a transpose operation (swap rows and columns).  The element at `input[row][col]` will move to `temp[col][row]`.
2.  **Reverse Columns:** After transposing, reverse order of elements in each row. The element at temp\[row]\[col] moves to temp\[row][-col-1].

In summary: it appears that we transpose the input grid, and swap the left and right sides.
