            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"transpose and reverse each row\") was partially correct. It captured the transposition aspect but failed to accurately describe the row reversal. The \"reverse each row\" operation needs further refinement. It seems that only the cells with non-zero values within each row of the transposed grid are actually involved with the reverse action. The zero-values always move to the beginning of the row. We need to adjust the program to reflect this nuanced behavior, focusing on how non-zero elements are reordered.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Observation:** Use `tool_code` to confirm the observation that the non-zero cells in each row of the transposed input are reordered, and zero cells are moved to the left of the row.\n2.  **Refine Description:** Based on verification, modify the natural language program to precisely describe the movement of non-zero and zero elements. The key is to characterize this as sorting where zeros are prioritized to be at the start of the row.\n3.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block summarizing the observed facts, including object properties (color/value) and actions (transposition, row-wise reordering based on value).\n\n**Metrics and Verification (using `tool_code`):**\n\nLet's verify the observation about zero and non-zero element reordering in the transposed input for both examples.\n\n"
