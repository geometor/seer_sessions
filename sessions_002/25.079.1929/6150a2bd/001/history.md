## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or external knowledge. The most obvious change is a rotation and/or reflection of the grid, accompanied by reordering of the rows and columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The values (colors) in the input grid are present in the output grid, but their positions are changed.
  - object: grid - A 2D array of integers.
  - property: dimensions - The height and width of the grid.
  - property: values - The integers within the grid, representing colors.
  - action: reordering - the coordinates are reordered. The values are conserved.
  - relationship: Input and output grids have a one-to-one mapping of values after transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate/Reflect:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise and and then flipped vertically. We could also get to the same result by flipping it horizontally and then rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise.
2.  **Preserve Values:** The values (colors) at each corresponding location after the rotation/reflection are preserved.

In short the whole grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, then flipped vertically (or flip horizontally then rotate 90 degrees cc).
