facts:
  - observation: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The values (colors) in the input grid are present in the output grid, but their positions are changed.
  - object: grid - A 2D array of integers.
  - property: dimensions - The height and width of the grid.
  - property: values - The integers within the grid, representing colors.
  - action: reordering - the coordinates are reordered. The values are conserved.
  - relationship: Input and output grids have a one-to-one mapping of values after transformation.
