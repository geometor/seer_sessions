The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or external knowledge. The most obvious change is a rotation and/or reflection of the grid, accompanied by reordering of the rows and columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The values are conserved.\n  - relationship: Input and output grids have a one-to-one mapping of values after transformation.\n```"
