task: 6150a2bd
facts:
  - observation: "The order of rows is reversed in the output compared to the input."
    type: grid_transformation
  - observation: "In example 1, after row reversal, 3s are replaced with 0s, and the single eight is replaced with 5 and vice versa"
    type: value_mapping
    example: 1
  - observation: "In example 2, after row reversal, 5s become 0, 2s become 0, 1s become 0, and 0s transform based on their original position: two become 5s, the middle one becomes a 1, and the 1,0 becomes 2."
    type: value_mapping
    example: 2
  - observation: "Changes in example 2 do not show a simple value mapping like swapping two digits; changes are positional"
    type: value_mapping
    example: 2
