            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and generated code were on the right track (reversing rows and swapping 3s and 8s). However, the tests reveal that the swapping of 3s and 8s isn't universally applicable. It only seems correct sometimes, suggesting a context-dependent rule. We need to analyze the *location* of the 3s and 8s and their relationship to other colors to identify the precise condition for the swap. Simply reversing the rows is correct, but the color swapping rule is incomplete. We need to determine the *context* where 3 and 8 are swapped.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll examine each example input/output/transformed output. I'll pay close attention to:\n    *   The initial positions of 3s and 8s.\n    *   Whether 3s and 8s changed in the *expected* output.\n    *   The positions of other colors relative to the 3s and 8s.\n    *   Differences between expected and generated output.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will refine the hypothesis about when 3s and 8s are swapped. It's likely related to their position or neighboring colors *after* the row reversal.\n\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will write a new natural language program that incorporates the refined swapping rule.\n\n4.  **Fact Documentation (YAML):** I'll create a YAML block summarizing the key observations and the refined rules.\n\n**Gathering Metrics (Code Execution is not needed here - manual inspection is more instructive):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, which shows we can inspect by hand and understand the data better than with code:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input:\n        "
