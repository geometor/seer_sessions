The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and a potential color shift. It looks like it could be some kind of grid rotation and reflection combined with swapping values. Crucially, the dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"

The bottom row of the input becomes the top row of the output, the second-to-last row of the input becomes the second row of the output, and so on.\n\n2. **Value Mapping**\n    There is a direct value mapping between cells of the input grid and output grid as follows:\n\n        input: 3 -> output: 8\n        input: 8 -> output: 3\n        input: 7 -> output: 7\n        input: 5 -> output: 5\n        input: 2 -> output: 2\n        input: 1 -> output: 1\n        input: 0 -> output: 0\n        input: 9 -> output: 9 (assuming that other values would map to themselves).\n\nEssentially, the grid is flipped vertically, and the values 3 and 8 are swapped with each other.\n\n"
