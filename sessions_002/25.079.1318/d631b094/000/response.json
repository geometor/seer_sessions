The input grids seem to consist primarily of the color black (0) with a single other color present in varying quantities and positions. The output grid seems to be composed solely of this non-black color, and its dimensions seem related to the number of non-black pixels in the input. Specifically, the output appears to be the minimal square that contains all the colored pixels of one color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
