observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 7, 8] # all colors from the input
      - description: Contains a background color (0) and a single foreground color.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (1x1, 2x2, 1x3, 1x4)
      - colors: [1, 2, 7, 8]  # non-black colors from input
      - description: Contains only the foreground color from the input grid. The color is repeated as a line.
  - relationship: transformation
    properties:
      - type: reduction
      - description: The input grid is reduced to a smaller grid containing only the foreground color.
      - logic: output grid seems to be a square of the input color.
      - observation: number of pixels of the one color forms the output
