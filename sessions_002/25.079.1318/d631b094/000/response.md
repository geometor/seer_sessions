Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grids seem to consist primarily of the color black (0) with a single other color present in varying quantities and positions. The output grid seems to be composed solely of this non-black color, and its dimensions seem related to the number of non-black pixels in the input. Specifically, the output appears to be the minimal square that contains all the colored pixels of one color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 7, 8] # all colors from the input
      - description: Contains a background color (0) and a single foreground color.
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (1x1, 2x2, 1x3, 1x4)
      - colors: [1, 2, 7, 8]  # non-black colors from input
      - description: Contains only the foreground color from the input grid. The color is repeated as a line.
  - relationship: transformation
    properties:
      - type: reduction
      - description: The input grid is reduced to a smaller grid containing only the foreground color.
      - logic: output grid seems to be a square of the input color.
      - observation: number of pixels of the one color forms the output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the foreground color:** Scan the input grid to determine the single non-black (non-zero) color present.
2.  **Count the foreground pixels:** Count the number of pixels in the input grid that have the foreground color.
3. **Determine the geometry:** determine the length of one side of the output from the number of non-black pixels
4.  **Construct the output grid:** Create a new grid. The output grid is filled entirely with the identified foreground color.
