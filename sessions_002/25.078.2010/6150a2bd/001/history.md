## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, where each digit likely represents a color. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the grid elements. There is a reflection. It does not seem like simple rotation and there is potential object movement. There seems to be a consistent grid size between input and output (3x3 and 3x3 in both pairs).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions in both examples.
  - object_types:
      - grid: 2D array of integers.
      - cell: single element within the grid, representing a color.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: (rows, columns) - consistent between input and output.
      - cell_color: integer value (0-9).
  - actions:
      - reflection: The arrangement of cell values is mirrored.
      - reverse_rows:  rows are reversed.
      - reverse_columns: columns are reversed.
  - relationships:
      - input_output:  Input grid transforms to output grid through a reflection.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reflect the grid:** The input grid is reflected across both its horizontal and vertical axes. This is done by the columns and the rows, resulting in 180 degree rotation.
