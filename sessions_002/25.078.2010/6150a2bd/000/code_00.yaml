facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions in both examples.
  - object_types:
      - grid: 2D array of integers.
      - cell: single element within the grid, representing a color.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: (rows, columns) - consistent between input and output.
      - cell_color: integer value (0-9).
  - actions:
      - reflection: The arrangement of cell values is mirrored.
      - reverse_rows:  rows are reversed.
      - reverse_columns: columns are reversed.
  - relationships:
      - input_output:  Input grid transforms to output grid through a reflection.
