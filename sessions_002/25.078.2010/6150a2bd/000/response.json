The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the grid elements. There is a reflection. It does not seem like simple rotation and there is potential object movement. There seems to be a consistent grid size between input and output (3x3 and 3x3 in both pairs).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
