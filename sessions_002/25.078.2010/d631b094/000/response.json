The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be related to the non-zero elements in the input. It appears that the zero values (white pixels) are acting as a background, and the non-zero values are the \"objects\" of interest. The transformation seems to involve extracting the non-zero values and arranging them in a new grid. The shape/size of output changes.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
