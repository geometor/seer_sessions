facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids vary in size (1x1, 1x3, 1x4).
  - observation: Input grids contain integers 0-9, where 0 is likely a background.
  - observation: Output grids seem to only contain non-zero values present in input.
  - observation: position of non-zero elements seems discarded
  - object: Non-zero pixels are the primary objects.
  - property: The non-zero number defines the output pixel values.
  - property: location of the non-zero element does not seem to be directly related to the output size or shape.
  - action: Extraction of non-zero values.
  - action: Arrangement of extracted values into a new grid.
  - relationship: The number of non-zero pixels in input relates to output grid size, count equals number of pixels in output.
