Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be related to the non-zero elements in the input. It appears that the zero values (white pixels) are acting as a background, and the non-zero values are the "objects" of interest. The transformation seems to involve extracting the non-zero values and arranging them in a new grid. The shape/size of output changes.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids vary in size (1x1, 1x3, 1x4).
  - observation: Input grids contain integers 0-9, where 0 is likely a background.
  - observation: Output grids seem to only contain non-zero values present in input.
  - observation: position of non-zero elements seems discarded
  - object: Non-zero pixels are the primary objects.
  - property: The non-zero number defines the output pixel values.
  - property: location of the non-zero element does not seem to be directly related to the output size or shape.
  - action: Extraction of non-zero values.
  - action: Arrangement of extracted values into a new grid.
  - relationship: The number of non-zero pixels in input relates to output grid size, count equals number of pixels in output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Scan the input grid and find all non-zero pixels.
2.  **Extract:**  For each non-zero pixel, record its value. The position is ignored at this stage.
3.  **Count:** Determine the total number, *n*, of non-zero pixels found.
4.  **Construct:** Create a 1 x *n* output grid.
5. **Populate:** Fill each cell of the output grid, from left to right with each extracted non-zero pixel value, repeating the same pixel *n* number of times.

In summary, this looks like we take each non zero pixel, we count those and create a new row with a pixel for each non zero pixel.
