facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Each row in the input grid appears as a column in the output grid."
  - observation: "The bottom row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and so on."
  - observation: "input example 1 is 3x3 and example 2 is 3x2."
  - rule: "The transformation is a 90 degree clockwise rotation, which maintains the grid size"
