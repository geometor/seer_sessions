The dimensions of the grid remain consistent between input and output. The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and potentially a change in their order. It's crucial to observe the positions and values of the digits before and after the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The first input row becomes the right-most output column, the second input row becomes the second-right-most output column, and so on, maintaining the original order of numbers within each row. The last row becomes the left-most column.\n\nEssentially, the transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.\n"
