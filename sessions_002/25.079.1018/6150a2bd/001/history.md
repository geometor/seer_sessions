## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the grid remain consistent between input and output. The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and potentially a change in their order. It's crucial to observe the positions and values of the digits before and after the transformation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Each row in the input grid appears as a column in the output grid."
  - observation: "The bottom row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, and so on."
  - observation: "input example 1 is 3x3 and example 2 is 3x2."
  - rule: "The transformation is a 90 degree clockwise rotation, which maintains the grid size"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate the grid:** Imagine taking the entire input grid and rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Output columns:** read off columns.

Or another way to express this:

1.  **Read Input Rows:** Treat each row of the input grid as a sequence of numbers.
2.  **Transpose to Columns:** Write each row sequence from the previous step as a *column* in the output grid. The first input row becomes the right-most output column, the second input row becomes the second-right-most output column, and so on, maintaining the original order of numbers within each row. The last row becomes the left-most column.

Essentially, the transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.
