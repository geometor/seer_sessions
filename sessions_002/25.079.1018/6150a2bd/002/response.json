            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the size of the output grid is consistent with the input grid, the pixel arrangements in both examples don't match a simple rotation. The \"pixels_off\" metric being 6 in both cases suggests a consistent error pattern, possibly related to reflection or a combination of rotation and translation. The color palette and pixel counts being correct indicate the transformation primarily involves rearranging existing pixels rather than introducing new colors or altering the number of occurrences per color.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Examination:** Carefully re-examine the input and expected output grids, paying close attention to the positions of individual colored pixels. Look for patterns beyond simple rotation, such as reflections (horizontal or vertical) or translations.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify potential \"objects\" within the grids based on contiguous blocks of color. Analyze how these objects move or change between the input and output.\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed examination, formulate a revised hypothesis about the transformation rule. This might involve a combination of operations (e.g., reflection followed by translation).\n4.  **Natural Language Program Update:** Translate the refined hypothesis into a clear, concise natural language program.\n5. **Further test** It will be beneficial to use all of the test examples and not just 2 to get a broader overview of the transform.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Conceptual - No Code Execution Needed Here):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Key colors: Blue (3), Orange (7), White (0), Gray (5), Azure (8).\n    *   Observed Changes from code output: 3xBlue incorrectly moved to top right, 1xGray moved to top. The colors in the code output is correct, but flipped vertically.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x2 grid.\n    *   Output: 3x3 grid.\n    *   Key colors: Red (2), Blue (1), White (0).\n    *   Observed Changes from code output: The colors are correct, but flipped vertically.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
