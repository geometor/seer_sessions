facts:
  - object_types:
      - grid: "A 2D array of color values."
      - cell: "A single element within a grid, represented by a digit (0-9)."
      - color_block: "One or more contiguous cells of the same non-zero color."
  - properties:
      - grid_size: "The dimensions (height x width) of a grid."
      - cell_color: "The color value of a cell (0-9)."
      - block_size: "The number of cells in a color_block"
      - block_color: "color of the block"
  - actions:
      - identify: "Locate color_blocks within the input grid."
      - extract: "Copy color_blocks' cell value to a new grid"
      - condense: "construct output grid with dimensions based on the total number
        of non-zero color cells"
  - relationships:
      - input_output: "The output grid is a condensed representation of the non-zero color blocks in the input grid."
      - cell_to_color: "Each cell's digit corresponds to a color."
