Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes (3x3 in these examples).\n*   The outputs are smaller grids, also rectangular.\n*   Each grid cell contains a single digit, representing a color.\n*   The color '0' (white) seems to act as a background or empty space.\n*   The other colors appear to be the \"objects\" of interest.\n*   The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-white colors in the input grid.\n*   It appears to be a rule for finding and packing colored blocks in a grid\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The dimensions of this new grid depend on the *number* of non-white pixels, repeating the colors as many times as each of them are present.\n"
