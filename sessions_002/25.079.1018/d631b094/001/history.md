Okay, I'm ready to analyze these examples and try to understand the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes (3x3 in these examples).
*   The outputs are smaller grids, also rectangular.
*   Each grid cell contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The color '0' (white) seems to act as a background or empty space.
*   The other colors appear to be the "objects" of interest.
*   The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-white colors in the input grid.
*   It appears to be a rule for finding and packing colored blocks in a grid

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_types:
      - grid: "A 2D array of color values."
      - cell: "A single element within a grid, represented by a digit (0-9)."
      - color_block: "One or more contiguous cells of the same non-zero color."
  - properties:
      - grid_size: "The dimensions (height x width) of a grid."
      - cell_color: "The color value of a cell (0-9)."
      - block_size: "The number of cells in a color_block"
      - block_color: "color of the block"
  - actions:
      - identify: "Locate color_blocks within the input grid."
      - extract: "Copy color_blocks' cell value to a new grid"
      - condense: "construct output grid with dimensions based on the total number
        of non-zero color cells"
  - relationships:
      - input_output: "The output grid is a condensed representation of the non-zero color blocks in the input grid."
      - cell_to_color: "Each cell's digit corresponds to a color."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Colors:** Scan the input grid and identify all cells that have a non-zero color (i.e., not white/0).
2.  **Count Non-Zero Pixels:** Count the total number of non-zero colored pixels found in the previous step.
3. **Determine Output Grid:** Create new output grid by repeating each non-zero pixel for the number of times it appears.
4.  **Populate Output Grid:** repeat the non-zero pixels in the new grid.

Essentially, the rule detects all the non-background (non-zero) pixels and reconstructs them in a dense, square-like output grid. The dimensions of this new grid depend on the *number* of non-white pixels, repeating the colors as many times as each of them are present.
