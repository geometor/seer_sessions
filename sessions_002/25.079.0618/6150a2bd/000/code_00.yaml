facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - objects:
      - type: "2D grid"
        properties:
          - "Contains digits 0-9, representing colors."
          - "Dimensions vary between examples but are consistent within each input-output pair."
      - type: "digit"
        properties:
          - represents: color
  - actions:
      - name: "rearrange"
        description: "Digits are moved to new positions within the grid."
      - possible_operation: reflection
      - possible_operation: rotation
  - relationships:
      - "Input grid transforms to output grid."
      - "Digits maintain their values during transformation, only their positions change."
      - observation: "the order of colors is flipped"
