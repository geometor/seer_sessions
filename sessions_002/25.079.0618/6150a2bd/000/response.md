Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.
*   The digits in the input grid seem to be re-arranged in the output grid, with a possible reflection or rotation involved.
* The order of colors seems relevant

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - objects:
      - type: "2D grid"
        properties:
          - "Contains digits 0-9, representing colors."
          - "Dimensions vary between examples but are consistent within each input-output pair."
      - type: "digit"
        properties:
          - represents: color
  - actions:
      - name: "rearrange"
        description: "Digits are moved to new positions within the grid."
      - possible_operation: reflection
      - possible_operation: rotation
  - relationships:
      - "Input grid transforms to output grid."
      - "Digits maintain their values during transformation, only their positions change."
      - observation: "the order of colors is flipped"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Reverse the order of the rows of the input grid.
3.  Reverse the order of the columns of the input grid.
4.  The result is the output grid.

Another was to say that is to rotate 180 degrees
