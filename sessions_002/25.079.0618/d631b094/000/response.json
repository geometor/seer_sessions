Here's my breakdown of my perceptions, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes, all containing the digit `0` and a single other non-zero digit.\n*   The non-zero digit appears to be the \"focus\" of the transformation.\n*   The output grids are smaller than the input grids.\n*   The output grids contain only the non-zero digit from the input grids.\n*  The number of times the non zero digit appears in the output is equal to the count of times it appears in the input\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
