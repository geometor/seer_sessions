Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of my perceptions, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes, all containing the digit `0` and a single other non-zero digit.
*   The non-zero digit appears to be the "focus" of the transformation.
*   The output grids are smaller than the input grids.
*   The output grids contain only the non-zero digit from the input grids.
*  The number of times the non zero digit appears in the output is equal to the count of times it appears in the input

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_digits: [0-9]
      - varying_size: true
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - contains_digits: [0-9]
      - smaller_than_input: true
  - name: focus_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - non_zero: true
      - unique_in_input: true

actions:
  - name: extract_focus
    input: input_grid
    output: focus_digit
  - name: construct_output
    input: focus_digit, count
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: input_contains
    from: input_grid
    to: focus_digit
  - type: output_contains
    from: output_grid
    to: focus_digit
  - type: output_size_determined_by
    from: count of focus_digit in input
    to: dimensions of output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Focus Digit:** Examine the input grid and identify the single non-zero digit. This is the "focus digit".
2.  **Count Focus Digit:** Count the number of times the focus digit appears in the input grid.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new output grid.
4. **Populate Output:** populate the output grid with only instances of the focus digit.
The number of instances should match the number of times to focus digit appeared in the input.

Essentially the operation finds the one color in the input grid and creates a new grid populated by that color, repeated the same number of times it was in the input.
