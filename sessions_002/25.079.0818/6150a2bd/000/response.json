The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the cell values, but rather a re-arrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. The colors are maintained during transformation, only their positions change.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
