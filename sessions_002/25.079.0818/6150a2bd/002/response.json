The code successfully transformed all training and test examples, perfectly matching the expected outputs. This indicates that the initial hypothesis of a 180-degree rotation was accurate and completely captures the transformation rule. No changes are needed.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nSince the code already performs the transformations correctly and the results include metrics (pixels_off, size_correct, etc.), there's no need for further code execution to gather additional metrics. The provided results clearly demonstrate a perfect match in all cases:\n\n*   `match: True` for all examples.\n*   `pixels_off: 0` for all examples.\n*   `size_correct: True` for all examples.\n*   `color_palette_correct: True` for all examples.\n*   `correct_pixel_counts: True` for all examples.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
