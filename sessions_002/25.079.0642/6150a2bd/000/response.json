Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.\n*   Each grid consists of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same in each example pair, but they can vary between different pairs (e.g., 3x3 in train\\_1 and 3x3 in train\\_2).\n*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements to form the output grid. It's not just a simple rotation or reflection because relative positions of cells is not preserved.\n*   The colors (represented by the numbers) in the input grid are all present in the output grid, and their quantities appear consistent.\n*   There appears to be mirroring with transposition.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
