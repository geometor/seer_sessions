facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The values (colors) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the grid elements.
  - hypothesis: The transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, followed by mirroring along the vertical center line, or some other rotation/reflection.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example 2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example 2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - action: transformation
    type: spatial rearrangement
    details: Preserves values, changes positions.
    possible_operations:
        - 90 degree clockwise rotation
        - 180 degree rotation
        - vertical reflection
