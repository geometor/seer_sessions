The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the examples). The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's elements, specifically a rotation or reflection, rather than a change in the values themselves. The colors/digits are preserved, but their positions change.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Here is an equivalent, valid program:\n\nThe input grid is transformed into the output grid by a horizontal flip, followed by transposing the grid, which means turning rows into columns and vice versa.\n\n"
