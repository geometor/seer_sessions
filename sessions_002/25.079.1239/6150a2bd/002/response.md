Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid *size* is consistent, the pixel arrangements are wrong in both examples. It seems there is a rotation, but not just a standard 90-degree one. It is a 90-degree *clockwise* rotation (equivalent to a 270-degree, or k=3, counter-clockwise rotation).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Rotation Direction:** The provided code tests suggest that output is similar to, but different from the input grid, indicating that the rotation isn't a standard 90, 180, or 270 degree.
2. **Detailed Pixel Comparison:** I need to meticulously compare the input and *expected* output grids, pixel by pixel, for both examples. This will help pinpoint the exact transformation rule. This requires carefully examining how each cell's coordinates change from input to output.
3. **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed comparison, I will formulate a precise natural language description of the correct transformation.
4. **Update the transformation function:** use the corrected program to update the transformation function to reflect the correct rule.

**Gather Metrics & Observations (using code for precision):**

I will use python code to perform a direct comparison and highlight the nature of the error.


``` python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    input_arr = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_arr = np.array(expected_output)
    transformed_arr = np.array(transformed_output)


    print(f"Input:\n{input_arr}")
    print(f"Expected Output:\n{expected_arr}")
    print(f"Transformed Output:\n{transformed_arr}")
    print(f"Shape Input {input_arr.shape}")
    print(f"Shape Expected {expected_arr.shape}")

    if input_arr.shape != expected_arr.shape:
      print("Shapes are different")
      return
    
    rotated_input_ccw_90 = np.rot90(input_arr,k=1)
    if np.array_equal(rotated_input_ccw_90,expected_arr):
      print("Correct Transform is 90 degree CCW (k=1)")
      return


    rotated_input_cw_90 = np.rot90(input_arr,k=-1)
    if np.array_equal(rotated_input_cw_90, expected_arr):
      print("Correct Transform is 90 degree CW (k=-1)")
      return
    
    rotated_input_180 = np.rot90(input_arr,k=2)

    if np.array_equal(rotated_input_180, expected_arr):
        print("Correct Transform is 180 degree (k=2)")
        return

```
```
Example 1:
Input:
[[3 3 8]
 [3 7 0]
 [5 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[0 0 5]
 [0 7 3]
 [8 3 3]]
Transformed Output:
[[5 3 3]
 [0 7 3]
 [0 0 8]]
Shape Input (3, 3)
Shape Expected (3, 3)
Correct Transform is 180 degree (k=2)

Example 2:
Input:
[[5 5 2]
 [1 0 0]
 [0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
[[0 0 0]
 [0 0 1]
 [2 5 5]]
Transformed Output:
[[0 1 5]
 [0 0 5]
 [0 0 2]]
Shape Input (3, 3)
Shape Expected (3, 3)
Correct Transform is 180 degree (k=2)

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed to the output grid by rotating the entire grid by 180 degrees. This is equivalent to flipping the grid both horizontally and vertically. The colors of the pixels remain unchanged; only their positions are altered according to the rotation.
