## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the examples). The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's elements, specifically a rotation or reflection, rather than a change in the values themselves. The colors/digits are preserved, but their positions change.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The values (colors) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the grid elements.
  - hypothesis: The transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, followed by mirroring along the vertical center line, or some other rotation/reflection.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example 2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1), 3x3 (example 2)
      - values: integers 0-9
  - action: transformation
    type: spatial rearrangement
    details: Preserves values, changes positions.
    possible_operations:
        - 90 degree clockwise rotation
        - 180 degree rotation
        - vertical reflection
        - horizontal reflection
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by performing a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation.

Alternative Program Description:

The transformation can be described in other ways, since we have very little to go on right now. Here is an equivalent, valid program:

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by a horizontal flip, followed by transposing the grid, which means turning rows into columns and vice versa.
