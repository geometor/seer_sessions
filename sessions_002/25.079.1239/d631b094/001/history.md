Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid (input) into a smaller, variable-sized grid (output). The output grid seems to be composed of non-zero values extracted from the input grid. The background color (or 'empty' value) is consistently 0 (white).  The non-zero values in the input (1-blue, 2-red, 7-orange, 8-azure) appear to be the focus. The spatial arrangement of these non-zero values within the input grid appears to dictate the size and content of the output grid. Specifically, the output grid contains *only* the non-zero colored pixels, and their count seems to correspond to the number of times that color shows in input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are consistently 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids vary in size (1x1, 1x2, 1x3).
  - observation: The background color in both input and output is 0 (white).
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input are retained in the output.
  - observation: The number of times the non zero color is present is captured in the output.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      background_color: 0
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      background_color: 0
  - relationship: Output grid contains only non-zero values from the input grid.
  - action: extract_non_zero_values
    description: The non-zero values are taken from the input.
  - action: construct_output
    description: A new grid is formed using the extracted values, matching the count of occurrences of each non-zero value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Identify** all non-zero pixel values.
3.  **Count** the number of occurrences of each unique non-zero value.
4.  **Construct** a new output grid. The number of cells filled with given unique non-zero color equals to the number of time the color is present in input grid.

Essentially, the rule is to extract each non-zero colored pixel and replicate it in the output grid as many times as its original count in input grid.
