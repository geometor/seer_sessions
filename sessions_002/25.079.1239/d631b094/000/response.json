The output grid seems to be composed of non-zero values extracted from the input grid. The background color (or 'empty' value) is consistently 0 (white).  The non-zero values in the input (1-blue, 2-red, 7-orange, 8-azure) appear to be the focus. The spatial arrangement of these non-zero values within the input grid appears to dictate the size and content of the output grid. Specifically, the output grid contains *only* the non-zero colored pixels, and their count seems to correspond to the number of times that color shows in input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
