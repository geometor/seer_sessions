facts:
  - observation: Input grids are consistently 3x3.
  - observation: Output grids vary in size (1x1, 1x2, 1x3).
  - observation: The background color in both input and output is 0 (white).
  - observation: Non-zero values in the input are retained in the output.
  - observation: The number of times the non zero color is present is captured in the output.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      background_color: 0
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      background_color: 0
  - relationship: Output grid contains only non-zero values from the input grid.
  - action: extract_non_zero_values
    description: The non-zero values are taken from the input.
  - action: construct_output
    description: A new grid is formed using the extracted values, matching the count of occurrences of each non-zero value.
