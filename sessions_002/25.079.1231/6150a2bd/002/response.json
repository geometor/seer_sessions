The tests on the subsequent examples reveal discrepancies, indicating that the initial program is incomplete. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** For each example, pinpoint the exact pixels that differ between the expected and transformed outputs. This will provide clues about the nature of the transformation error.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Analyze the errors across all examples. Are the errors consistent? Do they suggest a specific flaw in the rotation, mirroring, or some other operation?\n3.  **Program Refinement:** Based on the error analysis and pattern recognition, revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the complete transformation.\n4. **Code Update and Test**: Update and test the code until all training examples are correctly processed.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analyze Errors**\n\nTo accurately gather information I will execute the given code with additional print statements.\n\n"

The original program rotates and *then* mirrors. The correct transformation seems to involve swapping elements across the main diagonal (transpose operation), but not the simple matrix transpose that `numpy` provides, but some other operation.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The errors are more complex. (0,2) should be 0, is 2, which is in the top right. (1,2) should be 1, is 5, which is top left. (2,0) is should be 2, is zero, which is in multiple positions. (2,1) should be 5 and is 1, which is in the middle left.\n\nIt looks like the transformation is just a transpose, not the rotate and mirror that I came up with originally.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n"
