The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The transformation seems to focus on extracting specific non-zero values from the input and arranging them in a compact form in the output. The zero values in the input seem to act as a background or are ignored. The position of the non-zero values within the input grid changes but the output preserves the existence of the colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
