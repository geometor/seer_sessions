Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The transformation seems to focus on extracting specific non-zero values from the input and arranging them in a compact form in the output. The zero values in the input seem to act as a background or are ignored. The position of the non-zero values within the input grid changes but the output preserves the existence of the colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 3x3 (in all examples)
        values: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: variable (1x1, 1x3, 1x1, 1x4)
        values: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9) representing color
      - position: (row, column) in grid

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    description: Identifies pixels with values other than 0.
  - name: compact
    description: Arranges the extracted non-zero values into a smaller grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple pixels
  - output_grid contains a subset of pixel values from input_grid
  - zero_pixels are ignored in the transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all pixels with non-zero values.
3.  **Count** the occurrences of the identified non zero values.
4. **Create** the output by concatenating horizontally the identified non-zero value for the amount of times of it's occurrence .

Essentially, the rule is to extract all the non-zero color values, and create a new, row that is the length of the number of times the color appears.
