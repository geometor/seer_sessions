Both grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The dimensions of the grids are similar in the examples (rows, columns is close). The core of the task seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid's elements to form the output grid, involving a potential rotation or reflection.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The element in `temp[row][col]` becomes `temp[MAX_ROW-1-row][col]`\n\n3. **Reverse Columns**: reverse the order of columns of temp to create output.
