facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have similar dimensions, suggesting a rearrangement of elements rather than adding or removing many.
  - object_identification: |
      Each grid cell containing a digit can be considered an "object" with a color property.
  - transformation_type: |
      The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement, specifically a rotation,reflection, or combination.
  - relationships:
     - relationship_1: |
        Input [0,0] maps to Output [2,2]. Input[0][1] maps to output[1][2].
        The relationship between the coordinates is suggestive of a rotation or a transpose
        followed by a reflection on x and y.
