## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The dimensions of the grids are similar in the examples (rows, columns is close). The core of the task seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid's elements to form the output grid, involving a potential rotation or reflection.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have similar dimensions, suggesting a rearrangement of elements rather than adding or removing many.
  - object_identification: |
      Each grid cell containing a digit can be considered an "object" with a color property.
  - transformation_type: |
      The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement, specifically a rotation,reflection, or combination.
  - relationships:
     - relationship_1: |
        Input [0,0] maps to Output [2,2]. Input[0][1] maps to output[1][2].
        The relationship between the coordinates is suggestive of a rotation or a transpose
        followed by a reflection on x and y.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Transpose the Input:** Swap rows and columns of the input grid. Element at `input[row][col]` moves to `temp[col][row]`.

2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of rows.  The element in `temp[row][col]` becomes `temp[MAX_ROW-1-row][col]`

3. **Reverse Columns**: reverse the order of columns of temp to create output. Element at temp[row][col] becomes output[row][MAX_COL-col]
Essentially, this program describes a 180-degree rotation (or transpose and then flip both vertically and horizontally, or reflect both).
