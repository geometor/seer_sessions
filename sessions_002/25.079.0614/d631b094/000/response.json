The output grid seems to consist of only one non-zero color from the input grid, and this non-zero color appears to form a contiguous block or object in the input. The output grid's dimensions are related to the number of times that specific color appears.  The background color is always black (0).\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically the output will have x * x cells, where x is the number of non zero input cells\n4. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid filled with the prominent color.\n5. **Return:** output the generated grid.\n\nEssentially, the program isolates a single color from the input, counts its occurrences, creates a square using that color, and outputs it.\n"
