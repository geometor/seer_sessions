facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: All elements (colors) present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, and vice versa.
  - observation: The number of occurrences of each element (color) is the same in both input and output grids.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (where m and n are integers)
      - elements: integers from 0 to 9
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (same as InputGrid)
      - elements: integers from 0 to 9
  - action: Transformation
    description: Rearranges the elements of the InputGrid to produce the OutputGrid.
    details: The transformation preserves the elements and their counts but changes their positions.
  - relationship: InputGrid elements are mapped to OutputGrid elements bijectively (one-to-one correspondence).
