The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or external knowledge. It appears to be a rearrangement of the input grid's elements, potentially a rotation or reflection, combined with a consistent reordering of the rows. The colors themselves are maintained, just repositioned.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
