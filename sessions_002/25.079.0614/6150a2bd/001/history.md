## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or external knowledge. It appears to be a rearrangement of the input grid's elements, potentially a rotation or reflection, combined with a consistent reordering of the rows. The colors themselves are maintained, just repositioned.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: All elements (colors) present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, and vice versa.
  - observation: The number of occurrences of each element (color) is the same in both input and output grids.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (where m and n are integers)
      - elements: integers from 0 to 9
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (same as InputGrid)
      - elements: integers from 0 to 9
  - action: Transformation
    description: Rearranges the elements of the InputGrid to produce the OutputGrid.
    details: The transformation preserves the elements and their counts but changes their positions.
  - relationship: InputGrid elements are mapped to OutputGrid elements bijectively (one-to-one correspondence).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse the order of rows** Take the input grid and reverse the order of its rows.

2.  **Transpose:** consider the result as a matrix, swap rows and columns

The short version:
Reverse the order of the rows and then transpose the matrix.
