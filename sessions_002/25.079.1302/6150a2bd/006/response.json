However, the sorting logic is incorrect, leading to mismatches in both examples. The primary issue is the sorting criterion: it sorts based on the *maximum* value in a row, which isn't consistent with the observed transformations. Also, simply swapping the rows might not be correct transformation. A deeper understanding of how colors shift is needed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pixel Movements:** Instead of focusing on row-level operations, we need to track how individual pixels (or blocks of the same color) move from the input to the output.\n2.  **Re-evaluate Sorting:** Determine the *actual* sorting rule. It's likely not based on the maximum value. It could be based on the position of certain colors, or a combination of factors.\n3.  **Consider Color-Specific Transformations:** The transformation might treat different colors differently. We need to see if there's a pattern in how each color is handled.\n4. **Refine Natural Language Program** Make the program specific and refer to objects and relationships identified.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Evidence (using code):**\n\nLet's analyze the pixel differences and counts for both examples using a python tool.\n\n"
