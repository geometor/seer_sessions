observations:
  - type: grid_transformation
    description: The input grid undergoes multiple transformations.
    steps:
      - name: rotation
        description: The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
        details: Each element (i, j) moves to (j, N-1-i), where N is the number of rows (or columns after rotation).
      - name: mirroring
        description: The rotated grid is mirrored vertically (flipped upside down).
        details: Rows are swapped, reversing their vertical order.
      - name: row_reordering
        description: The rows of the mirrored grid are reordered.
        details: The rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements in descending order, with the largest sum at the bottom.
