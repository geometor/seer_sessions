However, the row sorting logic based on the maximum value within each row is flawed, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The primary issue is the misinterpretation of how rows should be ordered in the final output. Instead of sorting based on the maximum value, the examples suggest a different ordering criterion that needs to be determined.\n\nMy strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze the input and expected output grids of both examples to identify the true ordering principle of the rows. Pay close attention to the positions of all numbers, not only max values.\n2.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Formulate alternative hypotheses for the row ordering and, if necessary, use additional `tool_code` executions to verify pixel counts, color usage, or other relevant grid properties.\n3.  **Refine Program:** Based on the correct ordering rule, update the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.\n4.  **Iterative Improvement:** If new examples are provided, use them to validate or refine the revised program further.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the row ordering, let's use a Python tool to represent the grids and compare the ordering of rows in the input, expected output, and transformed output.\n\n"
