Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of digits (representing colors). The input grids have a larger dimension than the output grids. There's a single non-zero color in each input, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to be composed of the non-zero color from the input, and the dimensions of output grid change with each example. The critical aspect appears to be identifying the non-zero digit and replicating it to form the output grid. The number of replications defines the dimentions of the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 3x3.
      Output grids vary in size.
      Each input grid contains only one non-zero digit.
      The non-zero digit in the input is the same digit present in the output.
      Zeros (representing white) are present in all input grids.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 3x3
          - values: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable
          - values: integers (0-9)
      - name: non_zero_digit
        type: integer
        properties:
          - value: varies (1, 2, 7, 8 in the examples)
          - location: varies within the input_grid
  - actions:
      - name: identify_non_zero
        description: Locates the single non-zero digit in the input_grid.
      - name: replicate_digit
        description: Creates a new grid filled with the identified non-zero digit. The dimension appears related to the number of times the non-zero value appeared in each row.
  - relationships:
      - description: The non-zero digit in the input_grid is the value used to populate the output_grid.
      - description: The total number of times the non-zero value appear in any row and column of the input_grid is the dimentions of output array.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Scan the input grid to find the single non-zero digit.
2.  **Count:** Count the maximum number of times the non-zero digit appears in any single row.
3.  **Count:** Count the maximum number of times the non-zero digit appears in any single column.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new output grid. The number of rows is determined by maximum count of appearence in column. The number of columns is determined by the maximum count of appearance in rows. Fill the new grid entirely with the identified non-zero digit.
