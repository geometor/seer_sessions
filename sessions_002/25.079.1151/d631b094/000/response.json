The input grids have a larger dimension than the output grids. There's a single non-zero color in each input, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid seems to be composed of the non-zero color from the input, and the dimensions of output grid change with each example. The critical aspect appears to be identifying the non-zero digit and replicating it to form the output grid. The number of replications defines the dimentions of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
