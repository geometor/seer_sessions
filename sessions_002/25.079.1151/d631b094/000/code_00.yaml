facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 3x3.
      Output grids vary in size.
      Each input grid contains only one non-zero digit.
      The non-zero digit in the input is the same digit present in the output.
      Zeros (representing white) are present in all input grids.
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: 3x3
          - values: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable
          - values: integers (0-9)
      - name: non_zero_digit
        type: integer
        properties:
          - value: varies (1, 2, 7, 8 in the examples)
          - location: varies within the input_grid
  - actions:
      - name: identify_non_zero
        description: Locates the single non-zero digit in the input_grid.
      - name: replicate_digit
        description: Creates a new grid filled with the identified non-zero digit. The dimension appears related to the number of times the non-zero value appeared in each row.
  - relationships:
      - description: The non-zero digit in the input_grid is the value used to populate the output_grid.
      - description: The total number of times the non-zero value appear in any row and column of the input_grid is the dimentions of output array.
