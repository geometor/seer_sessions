facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Numbers in the input are rearranged in the output, not changed.
  - observation: There's a consistent spatial transformation, not a value substitution.
  - object: Input grid - A 2D array of integers.
  - object: Output grid - A 2D array of integers, a transformation of the input grid.
  - action: Rearrangement of input grid elements to form the output grid.
  - relationship: The transformation maintains grid dimensions and integer values.
