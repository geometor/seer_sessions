Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** The input is always a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color.\n*   **Output:** The output is always a single-digit integer. It does *not* appear to correspond to any of the colors directly.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.  The most obvious objects are lines of the same color.\n*   **Possible Relationships:** The output integer seems to be *counting* something in the input grid. It is unlikely to be a direct mathematical operation on the input numbers.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
