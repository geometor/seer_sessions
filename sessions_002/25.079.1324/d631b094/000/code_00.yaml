facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3, output grid dimensions vary.
  - observation: Input grids contain a single color other than 0 (white).
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: The output is composed of only the identified object, excluding any of the original white background (value of zero)
  - object: Non-zero pixels are treated as objects of a specific color.
  - property: Color of the non-zero pixels.
  - property: Count of non-zero pixels.
  - action: Extraction of the non-zero colored pixels.
  - action: Construction of a new grid containing only these extracted pixels.
  - relationship: Input color matches output color.
  - relationship: Number of non-zero pixels in input determines the size/shape of output.
  - hypothesis: The output grid's dimensions seem to be determined by making the array of the non-zero color as close to square as possible.
