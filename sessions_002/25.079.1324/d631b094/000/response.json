            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The transformation seems to focus on extracting specific non-zero colored pixels from the input and forming a contiguous block of those pixels in the output. The position of the color within input seems to be not directly preserved in output, and all zero valued (white) background are not in the output. The most important aspect seems the count of non zero colored pixels in the input determines the size of output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The geometry (shape) of the result will be a function of number of non-zero pixels.\n"
