Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The transformation seems to focus on extracting specific non-zero colored pixels from the input and forming a contiguous block of those pixels in the output. The position of the color within input seems to be not directly preserved in output, and all zero valued (white) background are not in the output. The most important aspect seems the count of non zero colored pixels in the input determines the size of output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3, output grid dimensions vary.
  - observation: Input grids contain a single color other than 0 (white).
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: The output is composed of only the identified object, excluding any of the original white background (value of zero)
  - object: Non-zero pixels are treated as objects of a specific color.
  - property: Color of the non-zero pixels.
  - property: Count of non-zero pixels.
  - action: Extraction of the non-zero colored pixels.
  - action: Construction of a new grid containing only these extracted pixels.
  - relationship: Input color matches output color.
  - relationship: Number of non-zero pixels in input determines the size/shape of output.
  - hypothesis: The output grid's dimensions seem to be determined by making the array of the non-zero color as close to square as possible.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the non-zero color (pixels with a value other than 0) in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of pixels of this non-zero color.
3.  **Create** a new output grid.
4.  **Determine** a width and height as close to square as possible so that all of the non-zero pixels will fit in the output.
5. **Fill** the new grid the same value as non-zero color.

Essentially, the program extracts all instances of the single non-zero color in the input grid and reconstructs them into a new, smaller grid, discarding any background of zero. The geometry (shape) of the result will be a function of number of non-zero pixels.
