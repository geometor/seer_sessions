  - overall_strategy: "Determine the placement of '5's based on color changes within the rows of the input grid, with special handling for uniform color."
  - objects:
    - name: input_grid
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - rows: variable (3 in examples)
        - cols: variable (3 in examples)
        - values: integers representing colors (0-9)
    - name: output_grid
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - rows: same as input_grid
        - cols: same as input_grid
        - values: integers, predominantly '0' and '5'
  - observations:
    - example_1:
      input_colors: "Unique colors in each row."
      output_pattern: "Diagonal of '5's from top-left to bottom-right."
    - example_2:
      input_colors: "Unique colors in each row."
      output_pattern: "Diagonal of '5's from top-right to bottom-left."
    - example_3:
      input_colors: "All cells are the same color."
      output_pattern: "First row is all '5's."
    - example_4:
      input_colors: "All cells are the same color."
      output_pattern: "First row is all '5's."
    - example_5:
      input_colors: "First two rows are the same color, third row is different."
      output_pattern: "First row is diagonal of '5's. "
