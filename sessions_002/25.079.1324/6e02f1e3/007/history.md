"""
The transformation rule involves checking for a change of input color across the rows (top to bottom), and that determines where to put the 5's. If all of the pixels on the rows are the same, put a row of 5's. If all the pixels of the row are different, put the diagonal 5's in that position, based on even or odd. Fill all remaining cells of output with 0

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on a limited understanding derived from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors. The core issue is that the logic for placing '5's is not correctly capturing the underlying rule. The initial idea of comparing consecutive rows is partially correct, but the diagonal placement and the conditions for a full row of '5's are flawed. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examining each input-output pair to identify the exact conditions under which '5's are placed.
2.  **Refined Logic:** Updating the rule to accurately reflect the placement of '5's, both diagonally and as full rows, potentially involving checks on changes in the input grid that don't include adjacent rows.
3. **Bottom-Up Approach**: consider a construction approach, rather than modifying input

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection for now, since I can see the images, future refinement would include image processing using tools):**

*   **Example 1:** Input has changing colors, colors are unique. Expected a diagonal of 5's. Got mostly that.
*   **Example 2:** Input has changing colors, colors are unique. Expected a diagonal of 5's, other direction. Got mostly that.
*   **Example 3:** Input has all the same colors. Expects the first row to be 5. Only got part of that.
*   **Example 4:** Input has all the same colors. Expects the first row to be 5. Only got part of that.
*   **Example 5:** Input has a solid block of 4, and row of 3. Expect diagonal, got top row.

Here's an updated report, focusing on facts and a natural language program:

facts:
  - task_id: 6e02f1e3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the Input Grid:** Examine the entire input grid.
2. **Uniform Color Check**: If the input grid has the same color in all the cells, then put a row of 5's in the first row of output. Fill rest of the output grid with 0's.
3.  **Check for unique row values:** Check the number of unique colors per row.
    *  If there are three unique colors in each row, put 5's diagonally across the output
        * if the first row is the *smallest* color, put diagonal of 5's top left to bottom right
        * otherwise put diagonal of 5's top right to bottom left
    * Fill remaining cells with 0.
