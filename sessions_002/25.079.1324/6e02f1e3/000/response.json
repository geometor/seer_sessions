The output grids seem to have a strong diagonal pattern or solid color in some cases, and the color gray (value 5) appears frequently. The relationship between the input and output isn't immediately obvious based on color alone. There's likely a rule that depends on the *arrangement* of colors and possibly their changes across the examples. The presence of zeros in the output suggests some form of masking or conditional replacement.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The direction of the diagonal appears to flip.\n  - observation: |\n    Examples 3 and 4 seem to be edge case where there is only one input color, where the top part of the output is all 5\n  - observation: |\n      In example 5, a diagonal of 5's from top-left to bottom-right.\n  - hypothesis: |\n      The transformation rule involves checking for a change of input color across the rows (top to bottom), and that determines where to put the 5's\n```"
