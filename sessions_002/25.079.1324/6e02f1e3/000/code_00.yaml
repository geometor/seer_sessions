facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are always square and of the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Input grids consist of pixels with values between 2 and 4 (red, green, yellow).
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain mostly 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - observation: |
      In examples 1 and 2, a diagonal of gray pixels (5) appears in the output. The direction of the diagonal appears to flip.
  - observation: |
    Examples 3 and 4 seem to be edge case where there is only one input color, where the top part of the output is all 5
  - observation: |
      In example 5, a diagonal of 5's from top-left to bottom-right.
  - hypothesis: |
      The transformation rule involves checking for a change of input color across the rows (top to bottom), and that determines where to put the 5's
