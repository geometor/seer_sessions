"""
The transformation rule involves checking for a change of input color across the rows (top to bottom), and that determines where to put the 5's. If all of the pixels on the rows are the same, put a row of 5's. If all the pixels of the row are different, put the diagonal 5's in that position, based on even or odd. Fill all remaining cells of output with 0
