The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic or color-based operations. Instead, it looks like a rearrangement of the grid elements, specifically a manipulation of their positions. The core operation appears to be a kind of mirroring or reordering, with the relative positions of some elements changing and others staying consistent, although the exact operation needs more detailed definition. There appears to be a column-wise re-ordering.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
