            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program describes a cyclic permutation of columns. However, the results across multiple examples show this is incorrect. The generated outputs consistently have discrepancies with the expected outputs. A simple cyclic permutation isn't sufficient to capture the transformation. A different strategy needs to make sure the columns are aligned. Instead of just shuffling existing columns, we probably need to consider a combination of observations to determine how pixels move *within* columns, or maybe a conditional rule based on where columns are.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Comparison:** For each example, meticulously compare the input, expected output, and transformed output. Note the specific pixel differences (row, column, and color).\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for patterns in how pixels move *beyond* simple column swapping. Are there row-specific changes? Are changes dependent on pixel color?\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the patterns, formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation rule and update the natural language program accordingly. It will almost certainly not be a simple permutation.\n4. **Object Properties**: Develop a hypothesis of object properties and use these to create a transformation rule.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll perform a detailed manual comparison, as code execution is not necessary for direct visual grid comparison at this stage. I will summarize differences in a structured way.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
