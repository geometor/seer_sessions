facts:
  - task_id: 74dd1130
  - objects:
      - description: Input and output grids are 3x3.
        properties:
            - dimensions: 3x3
            - type: 2D array
  - observations:
      - description: The transformation is not a simple cyclic permutation of columns.
        details: Examination of multiple examples reveals inconsistencies with a cyclic permutation hypothesis.
      - description: Row and column positions, as well as potentially pixel values, appear to play a role in the transformation.
        details: Further analysis is needed to determine the exact nature of these interdependencies.
      - description: Consider the first column of expected output, the columns in the input grid.
        details: Look for exact matches.
