However, the results on the full training set reveal this is incorrect. The code fails to accurately transform all examples, indicating a flaw in the underlying logic. The strategy should be to re-examine the input-output pairs, identify the *actual* transformation rule, and modify both the natural language program and the code accordingly. The provided metrics (pixels_off, size_correct, etc.) are helpful, but we need to analyze *why* the pixels are off to understand the true pattern.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Visually Compare:** Meticulously compare each input and expected output, paying close attention to how *each* pixel changes (or doesn't change).\n2.  **Identify Stable Pixels:** Look for pixels that remain in the same position across multiple examples. This can help anchor our understanding.\n3.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Based on the visual comparison, formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation.\n4.  **Refine Program:** Express the new hypothesis in a revised natural language program.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analysis (using code when appropriate):**\nI'll analyze and report the findings using the existing verification, and supplement with additional observations\n\n"
