facts:
  - observation: "The initial hypothesis of cyclic column permutation is incorrect."
  - observation: "All input grids are 3x3."
  - observation: Example_1:
      input: [[2, 2, 1], [1, 5, 1], [5, 2, 2]]
      expected: [[2, 1, 2], [2, 5, 1], [1, 1, 2]]
      actual: [[2, 1, 2], [5, 1, 1], [2, 2, 5]]
      analysis: "Pixels at (0,0), (1,1) are correct. Many others are wrong"
  - observation: Example_2:
      input: [[2, 2, 5], [6, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5]]
      expected: [[2, 5, 2], [2, 2, 6], [5, 2, 5]]
      actual: [[2, 5, 2], [2, 2, 6], [5, 5, 5]]
      analysis: "Pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1, 0), (1,1), (2,0) match, (2,2) is also correct"
  - observation: Example_3:
    input:  [[9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]
    expected: [[9, 5, 9], [9, 5, 5], [5, 8, 8]]
    actual:  [[9, 5, 9], [5, 8, 5], [8, 9, 5]]
    analysis: "Pixel at (0,0) match."
  - observation: Example_4:
      input: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 1, 1], [2, 6, 2]]
      expected: [[6, 6, 2], [1, 1, 2], [2, 6, 2]]
      actual: [[6, 6, 2], [1, 1, 2], [6, 2, 2]]
      analysis: "Pixels (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2) are correct"
  - observation: "There's no immediately obvious single geometric transformation (rotation, reflection) that fits all cases."
  - observation: "The transformation rule changes rows and columns"
