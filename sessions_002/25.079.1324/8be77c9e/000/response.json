The transformation seems to involve reflecting or mirroring the input grid, and potentially adding a boundary or padding of zeros (white). The size of the output grid is larger than the input grid, indicating some form of duplication or expansion. The key seems to be a vertical reflection and adding padding.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
