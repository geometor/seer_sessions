objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: [0, 1]
      shape: (rows, cols)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      values: [0, 1]
      shape: (rows, cols)

actions:
  - name: reflect_vertically
    description: Mirrors the input grid along a horizontal axis.
  - name: pad_with_zeros
    description: Adds rows of zeros (0) above and below the reflected grid, creating a frame or border.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    actions: [reflect_vertically, pad_with_zeros]

observations:
  - example_1: Output is a vertical reflection of the input with added rows of 0s above and below.
  - example_2: Output is a vertical reflection of the input, then rows of zeros are added.
  - example_3: Output is a vertical reflection with additional zero rows.
