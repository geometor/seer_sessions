facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
    description: Input grid is expanded into a larger output grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 2x2, 2x3, 3x3)
      - elements: integers representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: larger than input grid, specifically (input_rows + 2) x (input_cols + 2)
      - elements: integers representing colors, including 0 (white)
      - pattern: each input pixel is duplicated to form a 2x2 block in the output.
  - action: expansion
    description: Input grid is expanded by duplicating pixels and adding a border.
  - action: duplication
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically.
  - relationship: input_output
    description:  The output grid is a patterned expansion of the input grid. The output is derived by making each pixel a 2x2 block of that pixel and bordering the whole thing by zeros (color = 0).
