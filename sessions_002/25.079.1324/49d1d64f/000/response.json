The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with added rows and columns of zeros (white pixels). The core pattern seems to involve a duplication of each input pixel both horizontally and vertically, creating 2x2 blocks of the same color in the output.  The entire original input is framed by zeros.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Initialize all cells of this new grid with the value 0 (representing white).\n\n2.  **Duplicate Pixels:** For each pixel in the input grid:\n    *   Copy the pixel's value to the corresponding cell in the output grid, offset by one row and one column (due to the zero border).\n    *   Also copy the pixel's value to the cell immediately to the right, immediately below, and diagonally down and to the right of the position determined in the prior step. This creates a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid for each original input pixel.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes each pixel in the input and expands it into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output. The output is then the expanded result, but inset one pixel from all edges, forming a 0-value border.\n"
