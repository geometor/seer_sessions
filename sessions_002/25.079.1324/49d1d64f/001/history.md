Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with added rows and columns of zeros (white pixels). The core pattern seems to involve a duplication of each input pixel both horizontally and vertically, creating 2x2 blocks of the same color in the output.  The entire original input is framed by zeros.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid_transformation
    description: Input grid is expanded into a larger output grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 2x2, 2x3, 3x3)
      - elements: integers representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: larger than input grid, specifically (input_rows + 2) x (input_cols + 2)
      - elements: integers representing colors, including 0 (white)
      - pattern: each input pixel is duplicated to form a 2x2 block in the output.
  - action: expansion
    description: Input grid is expanded by duplicating pixels and adding a border.
  - action: duplication
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically.
  - relationship: input_output
    description:  The output grid is a patterned expansion of the input grid. The output is derived by making each pixel a 2x2 block of that pixel and bordering the whole thing by zeros (color = 0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Frame with Zeros:** Create a new grid that is 2 rows and 2 columns larger than the input grid. Initialize all cells of this new grid with the value 0 (representing white).

2.  **Duplicate Pixels:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Copy the pixel's value to the corresponding cell in the output grid, offset by one row and one column (due to the zero border).
    *   Also copy the pixel's value to the cell immediately to the right, immediately below, and diagonally down and to the right of the position determined in the prior step. This creates a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid for each original input pixel.

In essence, the transformation takes each pixel in the input and expands it into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output. The output is then the expanded result, but inset one pixel from all edges, forming a 0-value border.
