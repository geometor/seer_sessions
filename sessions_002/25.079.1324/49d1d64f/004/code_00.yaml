observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    actions:
      - iterate_pixels: Each pixel in the input grid is considered.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      size: (input_rows + 1) x (input_cols + 1)
    actions:
       - border_added:  A border of '0' (white) pixels is added around the output.
       - pixel_expansion: Each input pixel is expanded into 2x2 pixel of the same color.
  - action: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
    details:
      - input_pixel_mapping: "Each input pixel (r, c) maps to output pixel (r+1, c+1)"
      - expansion: "The color at input (r, c) becomes a 2x2 block with the same color at (r', c'), (r'+1, c'), (r', c'+1), and (r'+1, c'+1)."
      - index_mapping: "Map Input(x,y) -> Output(x,y)"
