However, it failed to accurately position the expanded pixels within the output grid, leading to consistent errors in pixel placement. The core issue is that the code expands each pixel into a 2x2 block, but incorrectly increases the indices when placing the pixel value and the adjacent 2x2 block expansion. This means that each horizontal and vertical pixel will overwrite the next 2x2 horizontal and vertical blocks.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Errors:** Carefully examine the differences between the \"Transformed Output\" and \"Expected Output\" for each example. Pay close attention to the positioning of the incorrect pixels.\n2.  **Refine the Transformation Rule:** Adjust the natural language program to accurately reflect how the input grid is mapped to the output grid, considering the border.\n3.  **Metrics gathering:** To test the assumptions in the natural language\n    program, gather metrics on the coordinates of the pixels in each of the\n    input grids.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**\n\nLet's generate information about coordinates\n\n"
