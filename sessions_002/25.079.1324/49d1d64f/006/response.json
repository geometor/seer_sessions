The output grid is supposed to be larger than input grid by one row and one column. It seems like in the generated code the output size grew by 2 on each dimension. The generated code is also off in which positions it's filling. The current program produces a filled border of values that match the right and bottom input grid edges.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Dimensions:** Double-check the expected output dimensions relative to the input dimensions across all examples. The text states the outputs should be inset by one, but currently it's by two.\n2.  **Correct Pixel Placement:** Refine the pixel placement logic. Instead of a 2x2 expansion, it is a 1x1 expansion at an offset. The offset in my code is too large, by 1.\n3.  **Border Handling:** Ensure only the outermost border is filled with 0s, not the internal row/column.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution to confirm):**\n\n"
