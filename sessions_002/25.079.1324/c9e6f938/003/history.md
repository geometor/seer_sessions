"""
The transformation takes each row of the input grid and expands it horizontally in the output grid. 
The output grid is twice as wide as the input grid.
For each row, the transformation duplicates any sequence of 7s (orange pixels) horizontally,
maintaining the relative positions of 0s (white pixels). The number of 0's before and after the
sequence of 7's are determined by their relative position in the input.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was partially correct, capturing the doubling of the orange (7) pixels. However, it failed to correctly position the doubled orange pixels and the surrounding white (0) pixels in all cases, particularly in Example 3. The strategy should involve a more precise understanding of how the white pixels are handled relative to the orange ones. The core issue is not just doubling the 7s, but also mirroring their placement within the row, while keeping original zeros.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including computed metrics where helpful:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Error: Incorrect placement of the first set of 7s. The provided program starts to the right, it seems, which is not correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Error: No error, this example, the algorithm implemented works, by chance.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)
    *   Error: The doubled 7s are placed at the beginning, not mirrored and placed at end.

**YAML Fact Block:**

facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells: integer (0-9, representing colors)

  - object: pixel

    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - row_index: integer
      - column_index: integer

  - transformation: row_expansion
    description: Each row in the input grid is expanded into a wider row in the output grid.
    rules:
      - width_factor: 2 (output width is twice the input width)
      - orange_duplication: Orange (7) pixels are duplicated.
      - mirror_effect: "The position of the duplicated orange pixels maintain position and any white space"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Width:** For each row in the input grid, create a corresponding row in the output grid that is twice as wide.

2.  **Duplicate Orange Pixels:** Iterate through the original input row. When an orange pixel (7) is encountered, insert two orange pixels into the output row.

3.  **Preserve Whites:** Maintain the empty space represented by white(0).

4.  **Mirroring:** When an orange is duplicated, it should keep the same distance relative to the edge that it occupied.

**Revised Natural Language Program (More Concise):**

For each row:

1.  Double the width of the output row.
2.  Iterate through the input row.
3.  Copy each pixel's value to the output row at same position.
4.  Duplicate any orange (7) pixel.
5.  Mirror the entire filled part of the row so the beginning is the same as the end.
