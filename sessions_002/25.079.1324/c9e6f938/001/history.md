Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of digits (representing colors). The digit `0` (white) seems to act as a background. The digit `7` (orange) appears to be the primary object of interest. The transformation seems to involve expanding or duplicating the `7`s in some way, while maintaining the background `0`s. The output grids are always twice as wide as the input grids.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: 0  # Background
        color: white
      - value: 7  # Object of interest
        color: orange

actions:
  - type: expansion/duplication
    target: pixels with value 7
    details:
      - horizontal expansion, doubling the width of the grid
      - maintains relative positions of 7s and 0s

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
  - input-output: output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, with specific rules governing the transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all pixels with the value `7` (orange) within the input grid.
2.  **Double the Canvas:** Create a new output grid that is twice as wide (number of columns) as the input grid, while maintaining the same height (number of rows).
3. **Expand the shape** Fill the new output grid. For each row, starting at 0, add 0s from the beginning of the row to the index equal to the count of `7`s that have appeared, then interleave the values from the original input, doubling any horizontal sequence of 7's.

Essentially, the transformation takes each row, and adds n `0`'s before and after the row, where n is the number of orange `7` pixels.
