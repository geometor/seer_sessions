            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was partially correct, capturing the doubling of the orange (7) pixels. However, it failed to correctly position the doubled orange pixels and the surrounding white (0) pixels in all cases, particularly in Example 3. The strategy should involve a more precise understanding of how the white pixels are handled relative to the orange ones. The core issue is not just doubling the 7s, but also mirroring their placement within the row, while keeping original zeros.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including computed metrics where helpful:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Error: Incorrect placement of the first set of 7s. The provided program starts to the right, it seems, which is not correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Error: No error, this example, the algorithm implemented works, by chance.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Error: The doubled 7s are placed at the beginning, not mirrored and placed at end.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
