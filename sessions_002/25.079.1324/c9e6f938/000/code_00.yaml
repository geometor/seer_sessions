objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: 0  # Background
        color: white
      - value: 7  # Object of interest
        color: orange

actions:
  - type: expansion/duplication
    target: pixels with value 7
    details:
      - horizontal expansion, doubling the width of the grid
      - maintains relative positions of 7s and 0s

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
  - input-output: output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, with specific rules governing the transformation
