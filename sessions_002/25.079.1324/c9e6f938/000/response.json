The digit `0` (white) seems to act as a background. The digit `7` (orange) appears to be the primary object of interest. The transformation seems to involve expanding or duplicating the `7`s in some way, while maintaining the background `0`s. The output grids are always twice as wide as the input grids.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

For each row, starting at 0, add 0s from the beginning of the row to the index equal to the count of `7`s that have appeared, then interleave the values from the original input, doubling any horizontal sequence of 7's.\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes each row, and adds n `0`'s before and after the row, where n is the number of orange `7` pixels.\n\n"
