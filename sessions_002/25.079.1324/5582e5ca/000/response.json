The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.\n*   **Colors:** Each digit corresponds to a color.\n*   **Homogenization:** The output grid consists of a single, uniform color repeated throughout.\n*   **Color Selection:** The color of the output grid seems to be derived from one of the colors present *within* the input grid. It is not a new color, nor is it consistently the most or least frequent. It appears to be a color found in the last column, and in train\\_2 it appears twice.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
