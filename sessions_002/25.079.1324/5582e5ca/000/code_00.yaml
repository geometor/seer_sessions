task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of color values.
    attributes:
      - dimensions: variable, but input and output dimensions match within a pair.
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.

transformations:
  - type: homogenization
    description: All cells in the output grid have the same color value.
    input: varied color grid
    output: uniform color grid

color_selection_rule:
  - type: specific_value
    description: >-
      The output color is present in input grid;
      the output color is present in last column of input grid;
      it appears multiple times in train_2 example;
    logic: deterministic, but the exact rule is not yet fully determined.
