Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was partially correct, handling the special cases (5->1, 6->2, 9->8) and incrementing some other digits. However, it's clear from the mismatches in examples 1, 2, and 4 that the incrementing logic is flawed. The mapping isn't a simple +1 for all other digits, and the color palette seems relevant after review.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and transformed output for examples 1, 2, and 4. Identify the exact digits that are being transformed incorrectly.
2.  **Develop Digit Mapping:** Create a complete mapping of input digits to output digits based on *all* examples. This is crucial since a simple rule isn't sufficient.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the complete digit mapping.
4.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Think about whether there are any special rules for 0 and 7, which haven't appeared yet. We need to include the entire range 0-9 in the program description.

**Gather Metrics (using code execution if necessary):**

We already have the visual outputs and comparisons. Let's put it in a table format. There isn't really a need for `tool_code` here, as the comparisons have already been performed.

| Example | Input Digits | Expected Output Digits | Transformed Output Digits | Correct? | Notes                                                                                                                               |
| :------ | :------------ | :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 3, 1, 2       | 4, 5, 6                 | 4, 2, 3                   | No       | 1 should map to 5, not 2. 2 should map to 6, not 3. 3 should map to 4, not 4 (but other instances of 3 map correctly, so not consistent)|
| 2       | 2, 3, 8       | 6, 4, 9                 | 3, 4, 9                   | No       | 2 should map to 6, not 3.                                                                                                           |
| 3       | 5, 8, 6       | 1, 9, 2                 | 1, 9, 2                   | Yes      | All mappings are correct.                                                                                                          |
| 4       | 9, 4, 2       | 8, 3, 6                 | 8, 5, 3                   | No       | 4 should map to 3 and 2 to 6, not 5 and 3, respectively.                                                                                        |

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid's digits are transformed to output digits according to the following mapping:

*   0 -> ? (we don't have an example yet, hold off assumption)
*   1 -> 5
*   2 -> 6
*   3 -> 4
*   4 -> 3
*   5 -> 1
*   6 -> 2
*   7 -> ? (we don't have an example yet, hold off assumption)
*   8 -> 9
*   9 -> 8

The transformation is applied to each cell of the input grid independently.
