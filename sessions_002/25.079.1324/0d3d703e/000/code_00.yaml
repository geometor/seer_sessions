facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 3
      cell_values: integers between 0 and 9 inclusive
  - type: transformation
    description: Element-wise transformation of input grid to output grid.
    properties:
      row_invariance: The transformation is applied identically to each row.
      element_invariance:  The output for a given input digit is always the same, irrespective of the input.
      input_output_mapping:  A specific mapping exists between input and output digits.
  - type: object
    description: Each digit in grid.
    properties:
      color: represented by the digit.
  - type: mapping_observation
    description: Observed mappings from input to output.
