Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern recognition and modification based on the presence of non-zero values. It looks like the non-zero values in the last column of the input grid are influencing the output. A replication or filling effect seems to be occurring, extending downwards and possibly influenced by values from the input's rightmost column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids of digits.
  - observation: Digits 0-9 represent different colors.
  - observation: The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.
  - object: Non-zero values in the input grid.
  - object: Zero values in the input grid.
  - property: Input grid's last column contains influencing digits.
  - action: Replication of values downwards in the output.
  - relationship: Output grid's values are potentially derived from a combination of input grid non-zero values, possibly influenced by rightmost column.
  - hypothesis:  For each row, the values in the last column of the input may get spread across the output row to create a fill-down effect.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the value in the last column of the current input row.
3.  **Iterate** through each cell in the current row of the output grid.
4.  **If** the corresponding cell in the input grid already equals to the identified value in the last column of the current input row, then fill this output grid's cell with this value.
5.  **If** the corresponding cell in the input is not zero, **and** is not equal to the identified value in the last column, fill the output cell with the value of last non-zero cell above it, if not found, fill the output cell with input non-zero value.
6. **Otherwise (if the corresponding input cell is 0), check the last column of current row. If the value is not zero, replace the current output cell with that value.**

In simpler terms, the program propagates the rightmost value of each input row across the same row, filling the cells of the output grid. If there exists cells in the current input row does not equal to the right most value, these cell remains in the output but also will fill to the cells below it.
