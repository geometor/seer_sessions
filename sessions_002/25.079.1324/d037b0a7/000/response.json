Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern recognition and modification based on the presence of non-zero values. It looks like the non-zero values in the last column of the input grid are influencing the output. A replication or filling effect seems to be occurring, extending downwards and possibly influenced by values from the input's rightmost column.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the value is not zero, replace the current output cell with that value.**\n\nIn simpler terms, the program propagates the rightmost value of each input row across the same row, filling the cells of the output grid.
