facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids of digits.
  - observation: Digits 0-9 represent different colors.
  - observation: The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical.
  - object: Non-zero values in the input grid.
  - object: Zero values in the input grid.
  - property: Input grid's last column contains influencing digits.
  - action: Replication of values downwards in the output.
  - relationship: Output grid's values are potentially derived from a combination of input grid non-zero values, possibly influenced by rightmost column.
  - hypothesis:  For each row, the values in the last column of the input may get spread across the output row to create a fill-down effect.
