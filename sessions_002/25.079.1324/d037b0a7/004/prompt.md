"""
The program iterates through each row of the input grid. For each row, it identifies the value in the last column. 
It then fills the output grid's corresponding row by replacing 0 values with the value from the input grid's last column of the same row.
If there exists cells in the current input row that are not zero and not equals to the right most value, 
these cell remains in the output but also will fill to the cells below it.
