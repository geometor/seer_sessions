Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perceptions, documented facts, and a natural language program description of the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements**\n\nThe task involves 3x3 grids. The transformation seems to be a downward shift of the non-zero rows. The specific row that gets shifted appears to be the topmost row containing any non-zero values.  The empty (all-zero) rows bubble to the top. There's no apparent change in the values themselves, just their positions within the grid. It appears to preserve the order of the other rows, including their colors\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"

A row is considered \"non-empty\" if it contains at least one cell with a value other than 0.\n2.  **Shift Topmost Non-Empty:** Find the topmost non-empty row. Move this entire row down by one position.\n3.  **Adjust Other Rows:** The original location of the shifted row is made an empty row.\n4.  **Fill Empty Spaces**: All \"empty\" rows (all cells are 0) bubble up to be the top rows of the grid.\n5.  **Output**: Construct output from the transformation.\n\nEssentially, the top-most non-zero row is shifted down one position. All zero rows are at the top.\n"
