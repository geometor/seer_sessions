The subgrid appears to be located in the upper-left quadrant of the input, but not always the absolute corner.  The key seems to be identifying a recurring 2x2 pattern of non-zero values surrounded by zeros, then extracting related cells. The background color is consistently black (0).  The extracted subgrids contain colors in the first and second columns, not repeating in the rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
