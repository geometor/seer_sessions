            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract a 2x2 subgrid based on specific criteria observed in the first training example. However, it fails to correctly transform the subsequent examples. The core issue is that the code is *too specific* to the first example's configuration. It assumes a very particular arrangement of the 2x2 subgrid (bordered by zeros, different color pixels, and non-zero values). The other examples violate these overly strict conditions. The strategy should be to generalize the subgrid extraction rule, relaxing the assumptions about bordering zeros and value differences, while still aiming for a 2x2 output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Analyze all training input/output pairs, focusing on identifying the common principles governing the 2x2 subgrid selection, rather than creating overly specific rules. Consider relative position and the limited set of colors.\n2.  **Relax Constraints:** Remove the zero-border requirement and the pixel value restriction. Instead, focus on finding any 2x2 subgrid, and try different positions and patterns.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test modified hypotheses against *all* training examples, not just one.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**\n\nThe reports show that the size is correct but pixel placement and count are off, indicating a consistent problem. The position of the found section is likely the error.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n"
