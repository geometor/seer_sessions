            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too narrowly focused on the first training example. It correctly identified the need for a 2x2 subgrid extraction, and the concept of a border of zeros is relevant. However, it failed to generalize to other examples where the specific 2x2 pattern within that isolated subgrid was different. The current logic *requires* that the 2x2 subgrid contains non-zero pixels to identify the region, and also different values across the two columns. The problem is to just extract *any* 2x2 grid that is isolated by zero-value pixels. The existing code *always* returns a 2x2 zero matrix if these checks do not pass.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refocus on Isolation:** The core concept of finding a 2x2 subgrid isolated by zeros is correct and crucial. We need to maintain this.\n2.  **Relax Pattern Constraint:** The initial code tried to make it so it must consist of nonzero values. The code fails to find such regions and therefore returns \\[\\[0,0],[0,0]].\n3.  **Verify on All Examples:** We have good test results, so apply code changes and re-test all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using provided code results - no code execution needed):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Output Shape: 2x2\n    *   Expected Output vs. Actual: Mismatch.\n    *   Notes: The code fails to identify the upper left quadrant, and returns all zeros instead of the expected 2x2 subgrid.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Output Shape: 2x2\n    *   Expected Output vs. Actual: Mismatch.\n    *   Notes: The code fails to identify the upper left quadrant, and returns all zeros instead of the expected 2x2 subgrid.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Output Shape: 2x2\n    *   Expected Output vs. Actual: Mismatch.\n    *    Notes: The code fails to identify the upper left quadrant, and returns all zeros instead of the expected 2x2 subgrid.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
