Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves extracting a specific 2x2 subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid appears to be located in the upper-left quadrant of the input, but not always the absolute corner.  The key seems to be identifying a recurring 2x2 pattern of non-zero values surrounded by zeros, then extracting related cells. The background color is consistently black (0).  The extracted subgrids contain colors in the first and second columns, not repeating in the rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: subgrid_extraction
input_grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 5x5
  - background_color: black (0)
  - has_subgrid: true
output_grid_properties:
  - dimensions: 2x2
objects:
  - name: subgrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - location: variable, within the top-left quadrant, bordered by 0s
      - composition: contains 2 columns adjacent
actions:
  - name: identify_subgrid_pattern
    description: Locate a 2x2 pattern that meets subgrid properties, potentially the first non-zero block
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Copy the identified 2x2 subgrid to the output.
relationships:
  - input_contains_output: The output grid is a subgrid extracted from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Scan the input grid** starting from the top-left corner (0,0).
2. **Search** columns and rows for a block of four numbers.
3. **Identify** non-zero values in a 2x2.
4. **Verify** the 2x2 block borders contains `0`.
5. **Extract** the the first two columns of the identified 2x2 block.
6. **Output** is the result.
