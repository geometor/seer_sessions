example1:
  input:
    size: 3x3
    colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    color_counts: {0: 3, 3: 3, 5: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}
  expected_output:
    size: 3x3
    colors: [0, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    color_counts: {0: 3, 3: 3, 5: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}
  transformed_output:
     color_counts: {0: 3, 3: 3, 5: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}
  observations:
    - The colors and their counts are identical in the input and expected output.
    - The transformed output has the correct colors but in the wrong positions.
    - The input grid appears reflected, then sorted to become the expected output.
example2:
  input:
    size: 3x3
    colors: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    color_counts: {0: 5, 1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 2}
  expected_output:
    size: 3x3
    colors: [0, 1, 2, 5]
    color_counts: {0: 5, 1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 2}
  transformed_output:
      color_counts: {0: 5, 1: 1, 2: 1, 5: 2}
  observations:
    - The colors and their counts are identical in the input and the expected output.
    - The transformed output has the correct colors, matching the input but different from expected.
    - The input grid is not reflected to become the expected output.
