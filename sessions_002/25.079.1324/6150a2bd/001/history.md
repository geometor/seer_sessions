## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair, but can vary between pairs.
*   The positions of the digits seem to be mirrored or flipped, and the values reordered. It looks like a reflection and re-sorting of the values.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid appears to be a reflected version of the input grid. It's a horizontal reflection (or mirroring) across the center vertical axis, which essentially reverses the columns' order.
  - observation: After mirroring/reflection, the values are also reordered.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: row x column
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)
    actions:
      - reflection: The grid is reflected horizontally.
      - sorting: Values in the reflected grid appear to be sorted.
  - rule: sort_order: descending

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reflect:** Take the input grid and reflect it horizontally across its vertical center. This means swapping the positions of elements across the central vertical axis. For example, the leftmost column becomes the rightmost, and vice-versa.
2.  **Sort:** Sort all of the values in the now reflected grid in descending order.
3.  **Rebuild:** Pop values from the sorted array to reform the grid in the original dimensions, filling by row from top to bottom.
