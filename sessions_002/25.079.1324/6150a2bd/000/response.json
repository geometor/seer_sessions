Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are both grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair, but can vary between pairs.\n*   The positions of the digits seem to be mirrored or flipped, and the values reordered. It looks like a reflection and re-sorting of the values.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

This means swapping the positions of elements across the central vertical axis. For example, the leftmost column becomes the rightmost, and vice-versa.\n2.  **Sort:** Sort all of the values in the now reflected grid in descending order.\n3.  **Rebuild:** Pop values from the sorted array to reform the grid in the original dimensions, filling by row from top to bottom.\n\n"
