facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The output grid appears to be a reflected version of the input grid. It's a horizontal reflection (or mirroring) across the center vertical axis, which essentially reverses the columns' order.
  - observation: After mirroring/reflection, the values are also reordered.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: row x column
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)
    actions:
      - reflection: The grid is reflected horizontally.
      - sorting: Values in the reflected grid appear to be sorted.
  - rule: sort_order: descending
