The grids consist of numerical values representing colors, primarily 0 (white) and 2 (red). There's a noticeable variation in the arrangement of '2's (red pixels) within the input grids, while 0s (white pixels) fill the remaining spaces. The output integers seem unrelated to the size of the input grids, instead they appear related somehow to the input grid. The presence of consistent output values for multiple distinct input grids (e.g., trains 1, 3, and 4 all output 1) suggests a discrete counting or categorization process, possibly conditional.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
