facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid (matrix) of integers.
  - observation: Output is a single-digit integer.
  - observation: Input grid values are primarily 0 and 2.
  - observation: 0 represents white and 2 represents red.
  - observation: Output is consistent for certain variations of input grid and differs for others.
  - hypothesis: The output depends on some global properties of the input grid, rather than per pixel calculations.
  - hypothesis: There may be a 'counting' operation after categorization.
  - hypothesis: The position of the red blocks does matter.
  - observation: '1' appears three times, '7' appears three times.
