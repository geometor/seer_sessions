facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids contain only 0s and 5s.
  - observation: Input grids contain a variety of digits from 0-9.
  - relationship: Output grid's 0/5 pattern is determined by the *rows* in the input grid.
  - condition: If an input row contains all identical values, the corresponding output row is all 5s.
  - condition: If an input row contains mixed values, the corresponding output row is all 0s.
