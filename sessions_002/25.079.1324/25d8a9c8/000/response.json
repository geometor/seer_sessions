The output grids seem to consist primarily of the digit `0` (white) and the digit `5` (gray). The input grids have more varied digits. There's a strong indication that the transformation is based on replacing all cells of the input grid with a new value. There is one object in the output, a rectangle with a uniform height, width and color. The height and width in the output are the same as the input. The color of the rectangle is `5` if any row in the input contains all of the same value.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
