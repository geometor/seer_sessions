objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: gray_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      value: 5
      row_index: integer
      col_index: integer
  - name: zero_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
        value: 0
        row_index: integer
        col_index: integer

actions:
  - name: replace_gray
    input: gray_pixel
    output: colored_pixel (2, 3, or 4)
    conditions:
        - if: gray_pixel is on a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right
          then: replace with 2 (red in the original output)
          example: (0,0) -> 2, (1,1) -> 4, (2,0) -> 2 from example 3 does not completely fit this condition.
        - if: gray_pixels are all in one column
          then: replace with 3 (green)
          example: Example 2.
        - if: gray_pixels form other shapes, use combination.
  - name: replace_zero
    input: zero_pixel
    output: colored_pixel (2, 3, or 4)
    conditions:
      - replace with the color of the nearest gray pixel if replaced
