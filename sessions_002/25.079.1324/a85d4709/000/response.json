Output grids use colors 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).  There's a clear, consistent replacement.\n*    The most prevelant color in input becomes a single color in the output\n* **Transformation:**  It appears the transformation involves replacing 5's with other single colors, and white(0) becomes one of those colors as well. The choice of color replacing 5 depends on the input grid's configuration of 5s.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
