Okay, I'll analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule and provide the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** Square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   **Output Grids:**  Square grids of the same dimensions as the input grids.
*   **Colors:** Input grids use colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray). Output grids use colors 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).  There's a clear, consistent replacement.
*    The most prevelant color in input becomes a single color in the output
* **Transformation:**  It appears the transformation involves replacing 5's with other single colors, and white(0) becomes one of those colors as well. The choice of color replacing 5 depends on the input grid's configuration of 5s.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (representing colors)
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 5]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - colors: [2, 3, 4]
  - relation: transformation
    properties:
      - type: color_replacement
      - mapping_gray: "gray(5) in the input becomes either red(2), green(3) or yellow(4) in the output depending on original position"
      - mapping_white: "white(0) maps to the color above, below, left or right of it"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 5s:** Locate all cells in the input grid with the value 5 (gray).

2. **Determine columns and rows**
    1. Determine the number of rows with 5's.
    2. Determine the number of columns with 5's.

3.  **Replacement Rule:**
    1. If only one row or column is identified in step 2, replace all 5's with 3 (green) and all 0's with 3 (green).
    2. If there are more than one row and more than one column:
       1.  If Row index = Column index, replace all 5's with 2 (red) and all 0's with 2 (red)
       2.  If Row index < Column index, replace all 5's with 4 (yellow) and all 0's with 4 (yellow).
       3.  If Row index > Column index, replace all 5's with 4 (yellow) and all 0's with 4 (yellow).

    Consider the row and col index as 0 based.

4. **Replace all cells** replace all cells to value determined from step 3.

5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.
