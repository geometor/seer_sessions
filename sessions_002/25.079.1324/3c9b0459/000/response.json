The transformation appears to rearrange the elements of the input grid to produce the output grid. The positions of the digits change, suggesting a spatial rearrangement or permutation of the input grid's elements. It is important to observe that every value in the input grid appears in the output grid, indicating the task does not involve any value substitution.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Imagine the input grid is fixed at the center.\n2.  Rotate the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.\n3.  The result of this rotation is the output grid.\n\nAlternatively we can consider this as doing two mirroring operations, vertical then horizontal, or vice-versa:\n\n1. Mirror the input vertically (top to bottom)\n2. Mirror the changed grid horizontally (left to right)\n\nThis results to equivalent output as the rotation.\n"
