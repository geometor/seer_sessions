Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code, designed to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise, fails on all provided examples. While the output grid maintains the correct size and color palette, the pixel arrangement is incorrect. This suggests the core transformation logic (rotation) is either misapplied or needs significant adjustment. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Verifying the Rotation:** Double-check the `np.rot90` function's parameters and behavior to ensure it's performing a true 90-degree clockwise rotation as intended. The `k=-1` parameter *should* be correct, but we need to be absolutely certain.
2.  **Re-evaluating the Examples:** Carefully examine the input and expected output pairs to pinpoint the *exact* nature of the transformation. It's crucial to identify if it's a simple rotation, or if there are additional complexities (e.g., reflections, color changes, or conditional movements). It looks as if rows are becoming columns but order looks reversed.
3. **Focus on differences**: examine the differences between predicted output and expected output.

**Gathering Metrics and Refining Observations:**

I'll use a code execution to output some differences between predicted and expected.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:**  Take the input grid, which is a 2D array of pixels.
2.  **Transpose:** Create a new grid where the rows of the input grid become the columns of the output, but in reversed order. Specifically, the *i*-th row of the input grid becomes the (N-1-*i*)-th column of the output grid, where *N* is the number of rows (which is equal to number of columns since it is a square matrix).
3.  **Output:** Return the resulting grid.

The key insight is that it's not just `np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)`. It performs a rotation but it does it in the opposite direction. We effectively need to reverse the order of the rows to get the expected result from a 90 degree clockwise rotation.
