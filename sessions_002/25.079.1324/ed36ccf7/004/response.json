            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code, designed to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise, fails on all provided examples. The consistent failure across all examples, with a specific number of incorrect pixels in each, strongly suggests that the rotation logic itself is flawed, or that the transformation involves more than just rotation. It's not a matter of minor adjustments; the core concept needs revisiting. The \"pixels_off\" metric indicates a consistent, significant deviation from the expected output, confirming this. The fact that size, color palette, and pixel counts are correct suggests the problem is with the *arrangement* of pixels, not their values or overall quantity.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples Visually:** Carefully look at the input and expected output grids side-by-side, paying close attention to how individual pixels or groups of pixels are moving. Don't assume a 90-degree rotation; look for other potential transformations (reflection, different rotation angles, or more complex operations).\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify distinct \"objects\" within the grids based on color and contiguity. Track how these objects change position and orientation between input and output.\n3.  **Hypothesize Alternative Transformations:** Based on the visual inspection and object tracking, formulate alternative hypotheses about the transformation rule.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** Describe the program in natural language, and be ready to write a corresponding python function.\n\n**Metrics Gathering & Analysis:**\n\nI need to explicitly call out the input/expected pairs to solidify my understanding. Let's put this in a structured, easily comparable way, focusing on color changes and spatial relationships.\n\n"
