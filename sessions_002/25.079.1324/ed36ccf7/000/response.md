Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The primary objects are rectangular grids of pixels. Each pixel has a single color value.  Within each grid, there are contiguous blocks of the same color, which can also be considered objects.
*   **Transformations:** The transformation appears to involve a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid.  It's crucial to confirm if it's a true rotation or a different operation that mimics rotation in these specific cases. The colors in the grid before and after remain the same, although their absolute positions in the x,y grid change
*   **Background:** The background color could be relevant, especially if it changes, but in these examples, a variety of colors are on the "background".

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
    dimensions: 3x3 in all examples.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of the same color can be considered objects.
  - type: transformation
    description: The grid appears to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    properties:
      - colors_preserved: true
      - rotation: 90 degrees clockwise # Hypothesis
  - type: colors
    description: various colors are used in both input and outputs
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  **Output:** Return the rotated grid.

The core of the transformation is the 90-degree clockwise rotation. This single operation explains the change from input to output in all provided examples.
