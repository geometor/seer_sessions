Each pixel has a single color value.  Within each grid, there are contiguous blocks of the same color, which can also be considered objects.\n*   **Transformations:** The transformation appears to involve a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid.  It's crucial to confirm if it's a true rotation or a different operation that mimics rotation in these specific cases. The colors in the grid before and after remain the same, although their absolute positions in the x,y grid change\n*   **Background:** The background color could be relevant, especially if it changes, but in these examples, a variety of colors are on the \"background\".\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
