The segment continues as long as the pixels have the *same color as each other*, the segment terminates when the edge of the grid is reached or a pixel of a *different* color is encountered.\n    *   **Column Segment:** Starting from the azure pixel, extend the segment upwards and downwards along the column. The segment continues as long as the pixels have the *same color as each other*, the segment terminates when the edge of the grid is reached or a pixel of a *different* color is encountered.\n\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:**\n    *   If a pixel is on a segment described in part 2, And if the segment's color is not 2 (Red), then change to color to 5 (grey).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these replacements. Pixels not part of any identified segment retain their original color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_segment(grid, row, col, direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets a segment of pixels starting at (row, col) in the given direction.\n    Direction: 0 for row, 1 for column.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    segment = []\n    start_color = grid[row, col]\n    \n    if direction == 0:  # Row segment\n        # Left\n        for c in range(col, -1, -1):\n            if grid[row, c] == start_color:\n                segment.append((row, c))\n            else:\n                break\n        # Right\n        for c in range(col + 1, cols):\n            if grid[row, c] == start_color:\n                segment.append((row, c))\n            else:\n                break\n    else:  # Column segment\n        # Up\n        for r in range(row, -1, -1):\n            if grid[r, col] == start_color:\n                segment.append((r, col))\n            else:\n                break\n        # Down\n        for r in range(row + 1, rows):\n            if grid[r, col] == start_color:\n                segment.append((r, col))\n            else:\n                break\n    return segment\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Identify Azure Pixels\n    azure_pixels = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 8:\n                azure_pixels.append((r, c))\n\n    # Define and process segments\n    for r, c in azure_pixels:\n        # Row segment\n        row_segment = get_segment(input_grid, r, c, 0)\n        first_color = -1\n        if row_segment:\n            first_color = input_grid[row_segment[0]]\n\n        if first_color != 2:  # if segment color is not red\n            for row, col in row_segment:\n                output_grid[row, col] = 5\n\n        # Column segment\n        col_segment = get_segment(input_grid, r, c, 1)\n        first_color = -1\n        if col_segment:\n            first_color = input_grid[col_segment[0]]\n\n        if first_color != 2:   # if segment color is not red\n            for row, col in col_segment:\n                output_grid[row, col] = 5\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
