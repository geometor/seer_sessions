The primary issue seems to be an over-application of the grey replacement rule. The current logic changes *all* non-red pixels in a row or column containing an azure pixel to grey. The failures in examples 2 and 4 indicate that the presence of *other* non-red colors influences if pixels should change color or not. It seems we're not identifying the correct \"scope\" of the azure pixel's influence. It's not the *entire* row/column, but a *segment* of it.\n\nThe strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Detailed Metric Gathering:** Analyze the examples to identify color and position information.\n2.  **Refine Object and Action Definitions:** Re-evaluate what constitutes an \"object\" in this context and how the azure color interacts with other \"objects\".\n3. **Revised Program:** Clearly articulate the conditions under which color replacement happens. It's crucial to specify the boundaries/limits of the grey replacement.\n\n**Metric Gathering (via code execution when required)**\n\nFor each of the examples, let's describe the location of the Azure colored pixels and what happens to pixels in the output. Let's manually construct dictionaries.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Azure Pixels: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)\n    *   Grey Pixels in output: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Azure Pixels: (1, 0), (2, 0)\n    *   Grey Pixels in output: (1,0), (2,0), (1,2)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Azure Pixels: (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    *   Grey Pixels in output: (1,0), (1,1)\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Azure Pixels: (0, 2), (2, 0)\n    *    Grey Pixels in output: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

The segment continues as long as the pixels have the *same color as each other*, the segment terminates when the edge of the grid is reached or a pixel of a *different* color is encountered.\n    *   **Column Segment:** Starting from the azure pixel, extend the segment upwards and downwards along the column. The segment continues as long as the pixels have the *same color as each other*, the segment terminates when the edge of the grid is reached or a pixel of a *different* color is encountered.\n\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:**\n    *   If a pixel is on a segment described in part 2, And if the segment's color is not 2 (Red), then change to color to 5 (grey).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these replacements. Pixels not part of any identified segment retain their original color.\n"
