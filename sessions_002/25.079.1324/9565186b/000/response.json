The most prominent change seems to involve the color grey (value 5) appearing in the output where certain other colors were present in the input. The surrounding context (pixels of other colors) remains unchanged. It appears as if a specific color is replaced by grey, and the choice of this color is not immediately obvious but seems related to the presence of color 8 (azure). Specifically, the color being changed (1-blue, 3-green, and 8-azure) always shares a row or column with an 8.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
