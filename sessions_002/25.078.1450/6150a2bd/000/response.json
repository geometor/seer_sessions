            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program description of the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids seem to have the same dimensions in each example pair, although the size varies between pairs.\n*   **Colors/Values:** Each cell in the grid has a single numerical value, representing a color. The examples use a subset of the full color range (0-9).\n*   **Rearrangement:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the input grid's values to form the output grid. The values themselves don't change, it is their order.\n*   **Mirroring/Rotation:** It's not a simple mirroring or 90 degree rotation of the full array. Sub-blocks of the grid or individual elements seem like they are rotated or mirrored.\n* **Sorting:** It appears that the rows are sorted, not reversed.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
