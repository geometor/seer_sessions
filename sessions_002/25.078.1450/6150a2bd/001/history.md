## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program description of the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids seem to have the same dimensions in each example pair, although the size varies between pairs.
*   **Colors/Values:** Each cell in the grid has a single numerical value, representing a color. The examples use a subset of the full color range (0-9).
*   **Rearrangement:** The core transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the input grid's values to form the output grid. The values themselves don't change, it is their order.
*   **Mirroring/Rotation:** It's not a simple mirroring or 90 degree rotation of the full array. Sub-blocks of the grid or individual elements seem like they are rotated or mirrored.
* **Sorting:** It appears that the rows are sorted, not reversed.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output data are represented as 2D grids.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, but same for input and output in each pair
      - cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors

objects:
  - type: cell
    description: Individual elements within the grid.
    properties:
      - value: integer (color)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

actions:
  - type: rearrange
    description: The core operation; input cell values are rearranged in the output grid.
  - type: sort
    description: sorting rows

relationships:
  - input_output: Each input grid has a corresponding output grid.
  - cell_position: The transformation defines a mapping of input cell positions to output cell positions.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Read the input grid:** Take the original 2D array.
2.  **Reverse each Row:** For each row, reverse the order of elements.
3. **Reverse the rows:** arrange the array, so the reversed last row is the first row, the reversed second to last row is the second row and so on.

In simpler terms, the transformation flips the input grid both horizontally and vertically. It can be thought of as a 180-degree rotation.
