Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The outputs are also grids, but smaller in size than the inputs.
*   The outputs seem to be related to the non-zero colored pixels in each input, and the position of the output within each input.
*   It appears the zero (white) pixels are acting like a background.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 3
      - height: 3
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: set
    properties:
      - colors: distinct integers from input_grid (excluding 0)

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: non_zero_pixels
  - name: create_output_grid
    input: non_zero_pixels
    output: output_grid

relationships:
 - input_grid contains non_zero_pixels
 - output_grid is derived from non_zero_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with a value other than 0 (white).
2.  **Extract Unique Colors:** From the non-zero pixels, determine the unique colors (represented by the non-zero digits).
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid.
    *   If there's only one unique color, the output grid is a 1x1 grid containing that color.
    *   If there are multiple instances of a unique color, the dimension of the output is the total number of times the unique color appear in input.
4.  **Populate Output:**
    *   Fill the output grid by repeating the unique non-zero colors to fill the output grid.

In summary, the transformation extracts the non-zero colored pixels from the input grid, identifies any colors other than 0, and creates a new grid based on these colored values, and fills in the output grid by repeating the identified color based on how many instances of the color are present.
