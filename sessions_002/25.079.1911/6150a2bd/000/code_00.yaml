facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: All input grid values are present in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation is a spatial rearrangement of elements.
  - hypothesis: The transformation involves a 90-degree rotation.
  - hypothesis:  The rotation is clockwise, from observing which direction the values are in the rows of the output.
  - hypothesis: The transformation may involve a reflection/mirroring after the rotation.  The reflection will be vertical, as the values go down the rows instead of across the columns.
