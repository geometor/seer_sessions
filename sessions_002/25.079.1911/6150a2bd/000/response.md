Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on discerning the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex arithmetic or color manipulation. Instead, it looks like a spatial rearrangement of the input grid's elements. Specifically, a 90 degree rotation combined with some sort of reflection or mirroring seems highly likely. The numbers themselves, their values, are preserved, it is their positions that are being changed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: All input grid values are present in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation is a spatial rearrangement of elements.
  - hypothesis: The transformation involves a 90-degree rotation.
  - hypothesis:  The rotation is clockwise, from observing which direction the values are in the rows of the output.
  - hypothesis: The transformation may involve a reflection/mirroring after the rotation.  The reflection will be vertical, as the values go down the rows instead of across the columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Reflect:** Reflect the rotated grid vertically (across the horizontal axis, flip it upside-down).

This combines to a rotation, followed by taking the mirror image (flipping it).
