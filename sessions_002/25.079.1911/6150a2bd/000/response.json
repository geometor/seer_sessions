The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex arithmetic or color manipulation. Instead, it looks like a spatial rearrangement of the input grid's elements. Specifically, a 90 degree rotation combined with some sort of reflection or mirroring seems highly likely. The numbers themselves, their values, are preserved, it is their positions that are being changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
