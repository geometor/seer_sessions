            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"rotate 90 degrees clockwise and then reflect vertically\") is incorrect, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The generated code implements this flawed program, leading to incorrect outputs. The strategy must be to re-examine the input-output pairs, paying close attention to the *actual* transformation, and derive a new, accurate natural language program. The pixel-level differences highlight the need for a precise understanding of how individual elements are repositioned.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Visual Inspection:** Carefully compare the input and expected output grids side-by-side, mentally tracking the movement of individual pixels or groups of pixels.\n2.  **Object Identification:** If possible, identify coherent \"objects\" (contiguous blocks of the same color) and observe how their positions change.\n3.  **Transformation Rule Hypothesis:** Formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation rule. Consider simple operations like rotations, reflections, or combinations thereof. It may also involve more complex operations but start with the simplest.\n4.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Validate new rule against all examples.\n5. Use color information as hints: If the color arrangement before and after gives a strong hint on how colors are mapped, take this into account.\n6.  **Iterative Refinement:** If the hypothesis is incorrect, analyze the errors, revise the hypothesis, and repeat steps 3-5.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using manual inspection for now, as I can't execute code yet):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *   Pixels Off: 2 (reported)\n    *   Observation: The transformation is NOT a 90-degree clockwise rotation followed by a vertical reflection. Visually it is like a horizontal reflection.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *   Pixels Off: 4 (reported)\n    *   Observation: The error in Example 2 further confirms the initial program is wrong. It seems like a reflection around the anti-diagonal, or a flip around the vertical axis (Horizontal flip)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
