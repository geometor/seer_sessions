facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The values within the grids are single-digit integers (0-9).
  - train_example_1:
      input_grid: |
        3 3 8
        3 7 0
        5 0 0
      output_grid: |
        0 0 5
        0 7 3
        8 3 3
      dimensions: 3x3
      relationship: "Input grid values are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and reordered in the Output grid."
  - train_example_2:
      input_grid: |
        5 5 2
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
      output_grid: |
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        2 5 5
      dimensions: 3x3
      relationship: "Input grid values are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and reordered in the Output grid."
  - overall_relationship: "The input grid appears to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise to form the output grid, with a consistent reordering of values along the new rows."
