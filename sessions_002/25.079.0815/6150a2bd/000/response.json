Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The dimensions of the grids are identical within each example pair (train_1: 3x3, train_2: 3x3), and values rotate. It appears the transformation involves some form of manipulation of the grid's values based on their spatial positions. The core operation seems to be a rotation or reflection, combined with a consistent reordering.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"
