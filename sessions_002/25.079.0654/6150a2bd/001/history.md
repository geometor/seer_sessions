## train_1

**input:**
```

```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples and deliver my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers representing colors. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. It appears the transformation involves a re-arrangement of the input grid's elements, specifically a rotation or reflection, combined with some potential re-ordering, mirroring, or directional offset. The color values are maintained during the process, but the positions change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors
  - property: dimensions
    description: height and width of the grid, which are equal in input and output
  - property: color_values
    description: integers 0-9, representing colors (refer to provided color map)
  - observation: element_rearrangement
    description: Positions of color values change between input and output
  - observation: transformation_type
    description: >
      Appears to be a rotation or reflection, possibly combined with
      reordering.  Specifically a counter clockwise rotation
  - object: integers
    description: >
      individual color values that can be moved in position as part of the
      transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
2.  **Reflect/Transpose**: the x and y of each element are swapped

The values of the grid stay the same, and the position of the elements is rotated and then the position is transposed.
