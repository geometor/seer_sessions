The output grid consists of a single, repeating digit, while the input grid contains a variety of digits. The key seems to be identifying a single digit within the input grid that becomes the sole value in the output grid. There isn't an obvious spatial or geometric transformation; instead, it appears to be a selection or identification rule based on the values themselves.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
