## train_1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```


**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```


## train_2

**input:**
```

## train_3

**input:**
```
4 6 9

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid. The output grid consists of a single, repeating digit, while the input grid contains a variety of digits. The key seems to be identifying a single digit within the input grid that becomes the sole value in the output grid. There isn't an obvious spatial or geometric transformation; instead, it appears to be a selection or identification rule based on the values themselves.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: integers (0-9)
  representation: colors
output:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: single repeating integer
  representation: colors
observations:
  - The output grid is homogenous (all cells have the same value).
  - The value of the output grid's cells is present somewhere within the input grid.
  - There's no clear spatial relationship (translation, rotation, etc.) between input and output.
  - The selected output value is a single digit repeated across all cells.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the value in the top right corner of the input grid.
3.  **Create** a new 3x3 grid.
4.  **Fill** all cells of the new grid with the value identified.
5. **Return** the new grid.
