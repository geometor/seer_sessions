facts:
  - example_1:
      input:
        object_1: "3x3 grid with values 4, 4, 8, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3, 0"
        top_right_value: 8
        most_frequent_value: 4
        output_value: 4
      output:
        object_1: "3x3 grid, all cells have value 4"
  - example_2:
      input:
        object_1: "3x3 grid with values 6, 8, 9, 1, 8, 1, 9, 4, 9"
        top_right_value: 9
        most_frequent_value: 9
        output_value: 9
      output:
        object_1: "3x3 grid, all cells have value 9"
  - example_3:
      input:
        object_1: "3x3 grid with values 4, 6, 9, 6, 4, 1, 8, 8, 6"
        top_right_value: 9
        most_frequent_value: 6
        output_value: 6
      output:
        object_1: "3x3 grid, all cells have value 6"
  - general:
      output_size: "always 3x3"
      output_value: "same for all cells within a single example"
      pattern: "The output grid is filled with the most frequent value of the input grid"
