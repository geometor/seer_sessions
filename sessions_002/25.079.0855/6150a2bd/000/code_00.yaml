task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation involves a rotation and/or reflection, along with reordering.

objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns (same for input and output)
      - elements: single-digit integers (colors)

  - name: color_blocks
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous region of pixels with the same color
     
transformations:
   - type: spatial
     description: A 90 degree clockwise and invert (3x3 input becomes 3x3 inverted output)
     details: >
            The input grid content will be reordered/inverted to output grid.

   - type: color_invariance
     description: Colors are preserved between input and output.
