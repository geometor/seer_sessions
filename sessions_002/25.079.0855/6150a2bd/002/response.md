Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it incorrectly assumed a simple row inversion. The second example demonstrates that the row inversion isn't universally true, and the pixel mismatches in both examples highlight the need for a more precise transformation rule. The core issue is that the combined transformation of rotation AND inversion of rows is not a consistent rule. We need a more precise rule.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze both input-output pairs, paying close attention to the *exact* position of *each* pixel before and after the transformation. Don't make assumptions, track everything.
2.  **Identify the Correct Transformation:** Determine the *precise* mathematical transformation. It's likely a rotation, but the row inversion, while it worked for example 1, is probably wrong.
3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the refined transformation, create a new, very precise natural language program.
4.  **Revised facts:** Update facts YAML, taking into account analysis of example 2.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, not code execution for now, as we're focusing on *perceptual* understanding):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Rotation: 90 degrees clockwise *appears* correct.
    *   Inversion: incorrect, there appears to also be a swapping of columns

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Rotation: 90 degrees clockwise *appears* correct
    *   Inversion: incorrect.

**Revised YAML (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: The entire input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    properties:
      - width: varies (3 in the examples)
      - height: varies (3 in the examples)
      - cells: Each cell contains a single digit representing a color.
  - action: rotate
    description: The grid appears to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    parameters:
      - angle: 90 degrees
      - direction: clockwise

  - observation: row_inversion_incorrect # add this
    description: Simply inverting rows after rotation does not produce the correct result, after visual inspection of the second example, a column swap is also performed.
```


**Revised Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. After the rotation, the columns of the rotated grid are reversed (the first column becomes the last, the second column becomes the second-to-last, and so on.).
