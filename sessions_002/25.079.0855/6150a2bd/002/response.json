            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified a 90-degree clockwise rotation, it incorrectly assumed a simple row inversion. The second example demonstrates that the row inversion isn't universally true, and the pixel mismatches in both examples highlight the need for a more precise transformation rule. The core issue is that the combined transformation of rotation AND inversion of rows is not a consistent rule. We need a more precise rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully analyze both input-output pairs, paying close attention to the *exact* position of *each* pixel before and after the transformation. Don't make assumptions, track everything.\n2.  **Identify the Correct Transformation:** Determine the *precise* mathematical transformation. It's likely a rotation, but the row inversion, while it worked for example 1, is probably wrong.\n3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Based on the refined transformation, create a new, very precise natural language program.\n4.  **Revised facts:** Update facts YAML, taking into account analysis of example 2.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using visual inspection, not code execution for now, as we're focusing on *perceptual* understanding):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 3x3\n    *   Rotation: 90 degrees clockwise *appears* correct.\n    *   Inversion: incorrect, there appears to also be a swapping of columns\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3\n    *   Output: 3x3\n    *   Rotation: 90 degrees clockwise *appears* correct\n    *   Inversion: incorrect.\n\n**Revised YAML (Facts):**\n\n"
