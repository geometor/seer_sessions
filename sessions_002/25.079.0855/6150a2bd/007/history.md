Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program ("rotate 90 degrees clockwise") was too simplistic. While the general idea of rotation is present, the specific implementation in `np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)` is incorrect for *all* provided examples. It seems the rotation might involve a combination of rotation and mirroring, or a different axis of rotation than initially assumed. The consistent `pixels_off` count of 6 in both examples, along with other correct properties, hints that a systematic error is present, related to the precise rotation/flipping mechanism, and not a fundamental misunderstanding of the task.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Visually inspect:** Carefully re-examine the input and expected output grids side-by-side, paying close attention to the *relative* positions of pixels, not just colors.
2.  **Experiment with `np.rot90` and `np.flip`:** Systematically test different `k` values for `np.rot90` (0, 1, 2, 3) and combinations with `np.flipud` (flip vertically) and `np.fliplr` (flip horizontally). This will help isolate the exact transformation.
3. **Hypothesize a refined rule and retest**
4. Create the updated natural language program

**Metrics and Observations (without code execution, since I can visually inspect and count):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 3x3
    *   Colors Present: 0 (white), 3 (green), 5 (gray), 7 (orange), 8 (azure)
    *   Observation: The top-right '8' in the input becomes the bottom-left in the expected output.  The bottom-left '5' in the input becomes top-right. This *suggests* either a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation or a combination of a rotation and a flip. The given solution seems to be mirroring the grid along the anti-diagonal.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Output Size: 3x3
    *   Colors Present: 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 5(grey)
    *   Observation: The top-right '2' in the input goes to bottom-left, and '1' at bottom left becomes top-right, much like in the previous example. Again indicates a similar counter clockwise rotation or rotation + flip.

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees *counter-clockwise*.
