## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both rectangular grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   **Colors:** Each digit corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the color map).  The examples use a subset of the available colors.
*   **Spatial Transformation:**  The transformation appears to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid, along with reordering. The dimensions of the grid stays same.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous regions of the same color.
* **Ordering**: The order is not obvious

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation involves a rotation and/or reflection, along with reordering.

objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns (same for input and output)
      - elements: single-digit integers (colors)

  - name: color_blocks
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous region of pixels with the same color
     
transformations:
   - type: spatial
     description: A 90 degree clockwise and invert (3x3 input becomes 3x3 inverted output)
     details: >
            The input grid content will be reordered/inverted to output grid.

   - type: color_invariance
     description: Colors are preserved between input and output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a grid of dimensions *m* x *n*.

2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.

3.  **Invert**: Invert the order of rotated grid rows to get the output.

4. **Output:** Return the new grid as output.
