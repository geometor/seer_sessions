facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: |
      Cells contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
  - observation: |
      Zero (0) represents white.
  - object: |
      Non-zero colored cells in the input grid.
  - action: |
      Propagation of color values.
  - object_property: |
        Original location of non zero colors.
  - action_property: |
        Direction of propagation seems to be downwards.
  - relationship: |
    The propagated value will be determined by neighbor value.
  - observation: |
      In train_1, the magenta (6) in the top right propagates to the two cells below. the yellow (4) cell propagates the value from the cell immediately to its right.
      In train_2, the red (2) in the top middle propagates down. the orange (7) and azure(8) propagate values from the cell immediately to their right.
      In train_3, the yellow(4) propagates down. the red(2) propagates the value from the cell immediately to its left.
  - rule: |
    scan each cell for a non-zero value.
    if a non-zero is found.
      scan below current cell for zero values, if a zero value is found, replace with neighbor of current cell, continue until the end of the column.
    The neighbor will be defined as the cell in this order
    - to the right
    - to the left
