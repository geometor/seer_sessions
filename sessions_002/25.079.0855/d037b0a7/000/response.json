The transformation seems to involve a directional fill or propagation of color values. Specifically, a non-zero color in the input grid seems to \"overwrite\" adjacent zero-valued cells (\"white\") in a specific pattern, extending downwards and possibly taking a value from the first overwritten cell.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
