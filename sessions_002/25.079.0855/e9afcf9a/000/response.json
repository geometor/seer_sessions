The colors used in the output are the same as the colors in the input. The dimensions of the input and output grids remain the same (i.e., same number of rows and columns).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Let's call them `row1` and `row2`.\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows and *n* columns).\n3.  **Create Output Row 1:** The first row of the output alternates between the color of `row1` and the color of `row2` from the input, starting with the color of input `row1`.\n4.  **Create Output Row 2:** The second row of the output alternates between the color of `row2` and the color of `row1` from the input, starting with the color of input `row2`.\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes the two colors present in the input grid and creates an output with the same number of rows and columns but in which the colors alternate column-wise. The two output rows are \"out of phase\" with each other.\n"
