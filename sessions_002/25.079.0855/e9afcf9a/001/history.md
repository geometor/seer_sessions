## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two rows of solid colored pixels in the input, which are then transformed into an alternating pattern of colors in the output. The colors used in the output are the same as the colors in the input. The dimensions of the input and output grids remain the same (i.e., same number of rows and columns).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: row1
    type: row
    properties:
      color: input[0][0] # First color in the input
      length: len(input[0]) # Length of the row

  - name: row2
    type: row
    properties:
      color: input[1][0] # second color in the input
      length: len(input[1])

transformation:
  type: alternating_pattern
  properties:
     output_rows: 2
     output_cols: len(input[0]) # same as the input
     row1_pattern: [row1.color, row2.color]
     row2_pattern: [row2.color, row1.color]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input consists of two rows of pixels, each with a uniform color. Let's call them `row1` and `row2`.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2 rows and *n* columns).
3.  **Create Output Row 1:** The first row of the output alternates between the color of `row1` and the color of `row2` from the input, starting with the color of input `row1`.
4.  **Create Output Row 2:** The second row of the output alternates between the color of `row2` and the color of `row1` from the input, starting with the color of input `row2`.

Essentially, the transformation takes the two colors present in the input grid and creates an output with the same number of rows and columns but in which the colors alternate column-wise. The two output rows are "out of phase" with each other.
