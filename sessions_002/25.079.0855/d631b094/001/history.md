Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a proposed natural language program:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The outputs are also grids, but smaller than the inputs. They seem to be related to specific non-zero colors present in the inputs.
*   The zero (white) color seems to act as a background or padding.
*   The position of the non-zero colors in the input grid influences the dimensions of the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [NxN]
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: [MxM]
  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: set
    properties:
      - colors: [1-9]

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: non_zero_pixels
  - name: count_non_zero_occurrences
    input: non_zero_pixels
    output: count
    description: how many of each color are present
  - name: construct_output
    input: non_zero_pixels, count
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains non_zero_pixels
  - output_grid size is determined by non_zero colors and layout.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with non-zero values (colors other than white/0).
2.  **Determine output color:** There is only one color used in output. Find that color.
3.  **Check non-zero color location, count color along that edge**:
    *   check rows and columns for non-zero color.
    *   count the number of times that the color appears on that edge.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create an output grid.
    *   Use the non-zero color found in step 2 for all pixels.
    *   The number of pixels is the number of times it was counted on the edge in step 3.

Essentially, the rule seems to be "find the non-zero color present in the input grid, examine which edge has that color, count it, and create an output grid filled with that color of that size."
