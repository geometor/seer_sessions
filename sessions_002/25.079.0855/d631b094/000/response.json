Here's my breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a proposed natural language program:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).\n*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color.\n*   The outputs are also grids, but smaller than the inputs. They seem to be related to specific non-zero colors present in the inputs.\n*   The zero (white) color seems to act as a background or padding.\n*   The position of the non-zero colors in the input grid influences the dimensions of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
