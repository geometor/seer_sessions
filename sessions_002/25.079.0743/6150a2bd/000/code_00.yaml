facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object_types:
      - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9).
      - row: A horizontal sequence of cells within the grid.
      - cell: An individual element within the grid, represented by a single digit.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: (rows, columns) - same for input and output.
      - cell_value: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
  - actions:
      - transpose: Swapping rows and columns. Effectively mirroring the grid along the diagonal.
  - relationships:
      - input_cell_to_output_cell: The value in output might not be same, a transformation of elements might occur during the row-column swap.
      - element_mapping: There appears to be element transformation during the row-column swap process.
