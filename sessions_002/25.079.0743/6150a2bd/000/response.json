The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color changes based on a fixed rule (like inverting colors). Instead, it looks like a rearrangement of the input grid's rows and potentially a change of element values in the process. It is critical to note, based on the two training pairs, that a mirror-like operation along the main diagonal occurs.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
