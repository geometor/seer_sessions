## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color changes based on a fixed rule (like inverting colors). Instead, it looks like a rearrangement of the input grid's rows and potentially a change of element values in the process. It is critical to note, based on the two training pairs, that a mirror-like operation along the main diagonal occurs.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object_types:
      - grid: 2D array of integers (0-9).
      - row: A horizontal sequence of cells within the grid.
      - cell: An individual element within the grid, represented by a single digit.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: (rows, columns) - same for input and output.
      - cell_value: Integer value (0-9) representing a color.
  - actions:
      - transpose: Swapping rows and columns. Effectively mirroring the grid along the diagonal.
  - relationships:
      - input_cell_to_output_cell: The value in output might not be same, a transformation of elements might occur during the row-column swap.
      - element_mapping: There appears to be element transformation during the row-column swap process.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Transpose:** The input grid is transposed. This means the rows of the input grid become the columns of the output grid, and vice-versa. Or put differently, the matrix is flipped over its main diagonal.

2.  **Value Mapping:** After swapping rows and columns perform the following value mappings:
    *   3 becomes 8.
    *   8 becomes 3
    *   5 becomes 5
    *   7 becomes 7
    *   1 becomes 1
    *   2 becomes 2
    * The numbers which become themselves do not matter as much as the ones that do not in trying to construct a mapping program.
