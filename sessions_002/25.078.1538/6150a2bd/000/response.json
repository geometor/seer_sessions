The relative positions of the colors change, but the colors present in the input are the same as those in the output, just re-arranged.\n* It looks like the values in the array are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then vertically flipped.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This means the top row becomes the rightmost column, the second row becomes the second-to-rightmost column, and so on.\n2.  **Flip:** Flip the rotated grid vertically. The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second to bottom row, and so on.\n\nAnother way to consider what is happening, conceptually, is performing these operations on the indices:\n\n1. Consider the input to be i,j\n2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise becomes j, (input\\_width - 1) - i\n3. Reflect vertically becomes (input\\_height - 1) - j, (input\\_width -1) - i\n\n"
