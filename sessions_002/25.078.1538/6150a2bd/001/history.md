## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
*   The numbers in the grids represent colors (as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`).
*   The transformation appears to involve a rotation and/or reflection of the grid. The relative positions of the colors change, but the colors present in the input are the same as those in the output, just re-arranged.
* It looks like the values in the array are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then vertically flipped.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of single-digit integers.
  - type: dimension
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - type: values
    description: Grid cell values represent colors (0-9).
  - type: transformation
    description:  The grid values appears to rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then flipped vertically
  - type: objects
    description: each color can be considered an object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. This means the top row becomes the rightmost column, the second row becomes the second-to-rightmost column, and so on.
2.  **Flip:** Flip the rotated grid vertically. The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second to bottom row, and so on.

Another way to consider what is happening, conceptually, is performing these operations on the indices:

1. Consider the input to be i,j
2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise becomes j, (input\_width - 1) - i
3. Reflect vertically becomes (input\_height - 1) - j, (input\_width -1) - i
