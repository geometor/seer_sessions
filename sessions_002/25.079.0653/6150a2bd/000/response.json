The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both 3x3 in the first example and probably 3 x 3 in the second). The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement (permutation) of the grid elements, rather than a change in the values themselves. It looks like a rotation or reflection, since a simple observation of the numbers shows the rows of the input are the columns of the output, but in reverse order.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Alternatively, it can be seen as transposing the matrix, then reversing the order of rows.\n"
