The digits likely correspond to colors, as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`.\n*   **Reversal:** It appears there's a reversal or mirroring involved.\n*   **Dimension Change:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions, 3x3 for the first pair, and 3x3 for the second pair. This swap of dimensions and potential reordering hints at a rotation or reflection.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
