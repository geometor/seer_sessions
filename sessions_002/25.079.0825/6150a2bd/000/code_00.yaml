  - objects:
      - grid: The primary object is the grid itself.
      - cells: Individual cells within the grid, each holding a color value.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same width and height but it is swapped.
      - cell_values: Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - actions:
      - reflection: The content of the grid seems to perform a reflection.
      - rotation: A swap in dimensions of the grid.
  - relationships:
      - spatial: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
      - transformation: The input grid's cell values are mapped to the output grid's cell values based on the reflection and swap operation.
