## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are represented as grids of digits. The digits likely correspond to colors, as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`.
*   **Reversal:** It appears there's a reversal or mirroring involved.
*   **Dimension Change:** The input and output grids have the same dimensions, 3x3 for the first pair, and 3x3 for the second pair. This swap of dimensions and potential reordering hints at a rotation or reflection.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are rectangular and composed of single-digit integers representing colors.
  - objects:
      - grid: The primary object is the grid itself.
      - cells: Individual cells within the grid, each holding a color value.
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: Input and output grids have the same width and height but it is swapped.
      - cell_values: Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - actions:
      - reflection: The content of the grid seems to perform a reflection.
      - rotation: A swap in dimensions of the grid.
  - relationships:
      - spatial: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
      - transformation: The input grid's cell values are mapped to the output grid's cell values based on the reflection and swap operation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror the input grid.** The transformation seems to involve mirroring the input data across a diagonal axis, effectively performing what we call a matrix transpose.
2.  **Rotate the grid**. Swap columns and rows and then assign the values of the input grid to the mirrored locations in the output grid.

In short, the input grid is transposed to create the output grid.
