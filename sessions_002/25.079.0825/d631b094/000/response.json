The input grids seem to have a single non-zero color \"embedded\" in a field of zeros (white).\u00a0The output grid consists only of the non-zero color from the input grid, and its dimensions seem related to the *number* of instances of that color in the input grid. The position of the non-zero pixels seems irrelevant - only the *count* matters.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
