The output grid seems to consist of a single, repeated digit. The key seems to be identifying which digit from the input grid becomes the repeated digit in the output grid. There isn't an obvious spatial transformation (like rotation or reflection). The transformation is based on selecting a single value from the set of input colors and then filling the entire output with that value.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
