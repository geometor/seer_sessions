## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples and attempt to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (e.g., 3x3 in the first example, 3x3 in the second).
*   The digits in the input grid appear to be re-arranged in the output grid. It seems like there's a consistent mapping or reordering happening, and no new digits are introduced, no digit is lost.
*   The transformation involves some form of rotation or mirroring, the position of the digits in the input grid is changed and reflected in the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
  - type: digits
    description: Digits 0-9 represent colors.
  - type: transformation
    description: Digits are re-arranged from input to output, not changed or altered.
  - type: operation
    possible_operations: [rotation, mirroring, transposition]
  - type: observation
    example_1: input and output are 3x3 grids.
    example_2: input and output are 3x3 grids.
  - type: relationship:
      input: digits in a specific arrangement
      output: digits in a rearranged arrangement

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid.
2.  **Transpose** the input grid, swapping rows and columns.
    *   The element at input\[row]\[col] moves to output\[col]\[row].
3.   Output the new transposed grid.

Essentially. The program appears to take the transpose of the matrix.
