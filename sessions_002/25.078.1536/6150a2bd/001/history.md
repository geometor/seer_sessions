## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's elements, specifically a rotation and reflection, and also a specific reordering of the rows. The core concept is a change in orientation and order of rows.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: "grid"
    description: "Input and output are 2D arrays of integers (0-9)."
  - type: "dimensions"
    description: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair."
  - type: "transformation"
    description: "The transformation rearranges elements, involving rotation and reflection."
  - type: "row_operation"
    description: "Rows from the input appear to be reordered and potentially inverted in the output."
  - type: "possible_operations"
    value: ["rotation", "reflection", "row_reversal", "row_reordering"]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of the rows in the rotated grid.

Another way to define this transformation.

1.  **Transpose:**  Reflect the input grid across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
2. **Reverse Rows** Reverse the order of the rows.
