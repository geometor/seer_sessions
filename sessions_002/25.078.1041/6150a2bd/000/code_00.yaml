facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions in both provided examples.
  - object_types:
      - grid: 2D array of integers.
      - cell: Individual element within the grid, represented by an integer (color).
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: [rows, columns] (same for input and output)
      - cell_value: integer (0-9)
  - actions:
      - spatial_rearrangement: |
          The positions of the cells are changed from input to output,
          suggesting operations like rotation or reflection.
  - relationships:
    - input_output_dimension_match: "Input and output grids have identical dimensions."
    - element_index_change: "Elements are present at different index locations between the input and output."
