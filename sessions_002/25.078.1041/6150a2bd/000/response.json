The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers. Instead, it appears to be a spatial manipulation or rearrangement of the input grid's elements, potentially involving rotations, reflections, or a combination of both. It's crucial to note the specific positions and colors are maintained but re-arranged within the input grid. The output grids mirrors input grids row and column indexing.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
