Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are 3x3 grids.
*   The outputs are smaller grids, with varying dimensions (1x2, 1x3, 1x1, 1x4).
*   Each grid cell contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The background color of input grid is always black (0).
*   The non-black colors in the input grid appear to be the "source" of the output.
*   The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-black color present in the input.
*    The position or layout of the non black-color does not appear to effect the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size_varies: true
  - input_background_color: black (0)
  - output_contains_input_non_black_colors: true
  - input_non_black_color_count: 1
  - output_color_count_matches_non_black_input_color_instances: true
  - input_object_shape: variable
  - output_shape: row
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-black color in the input grid.
2.  Count the number of times this color appears in the input grid.
3.  Create a new 1-dimensional output grid (a row).
4.  The length of output grid's should match the count from step 2.
5. Populate every cell of the output with the identified non-black color from Step 1.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the non-black color from the input grid and creates a row of that color, where length of output row is equal to the number of time that color appears in the input.
