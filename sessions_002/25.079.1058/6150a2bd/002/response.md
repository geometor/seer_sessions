Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation description:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program ("transpose and reverse each row") was too simplistic. While it captures some aspect of the transformation, it's not entirely accurate, as evidenced by the mismatches in both examples. The core issue is that the row reversal is applied *after* transposition, but the actual transformation seems to involve a different kind of reflection or rotation. It's not a simple horizontal flip of the transposed grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Careful Re-examination:** We need to visually inspect the input and expected output grids side-by-side, paying close attention to the *exact* movement of individual pixels.  Transposition followed by row reversal is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation, however the actual correct output is a -90 degree rotation (or 270 degree rotation.)
2.  **Precise Language:** The updated natural language program must be very specific about the axis or point of reflection/rotation.  Vague terms like "reverse" are insufficient.
3. **Fact Documentation:** I need to document example grids that identify corresponding locations.

**Metrics and Observations (using visual comparison, no code execution needed for this simple case):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3
    *   Output: 3x3
    *   Observation: It looks like a -90 degree rotation (clockwise). The top-left element (3) becomes the bottom-left, the top-right (8) becomes top-left.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x2
    *   Output: 2x3
    *   Observation:  Again, it's like a -90 degree rotation. The long side becomes vertical.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_grid:
      - [3, 3, 8]
      - [3, 7, 0]

    output_grid:
      - [0, 0, 5]
      - [0, 7, 3]
      - [8, 3, 3]
    transformations:
      - type: rotation
        degrees: -90
        notes: Top-left element moves to bottom-left.

    transformations:
      - type: rotation
        degrees: -90

    objects:

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated -90 degrees (270 degrees clockwise).
