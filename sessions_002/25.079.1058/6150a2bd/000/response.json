The dimensions of the grid remain consistent (same number of rows and columns in input and output). The most prominent change appears to be a rotation or reflection of some kind, along with a potential change in the order of the rows. The values themselves seem to be preserved, suggesting a rearrangement rather than a value-based calculation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The element at `input[row][col]` becomes `temp[col][row]`.\n2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse each row in the transposed `temp` grid. So the last value becomes the first, second to last becomes the second, and so on.\n3.  **Output Result:** This new `temp` grid, after transposing and reversing the rows, becomes the output grid.\n\nIn simpler terms, the input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then each horizontal line is read in the reverse order.\n"
