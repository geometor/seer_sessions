example_1:
  input_objects:
    - object_1:  # Objectness: A contiguous block of color
        shape: rectangle
        pixels: [[3, 3, 8], [3, 7, 0], [5, 0, 0]]
  output_objects:
    - object_1:
        shape: rectangle
        pixels: [[0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 3], [8, 3, 3]]
  transformation:
    - step_1: Transpose the input grid.  Rows become columns, and columns become rows.
    - step_2: Reverse each *column* of the transposed grid.

    - object_1:
        shape: rectangle
        pixels: [[5, 5, 2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

    - object_1:
        shape: rectangle
        pixels: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, 5, 5]]
  transformation:
    - step_1: Transpose the input grid. Rows become columns, and columns become rows.
    - step_2: Reverse each *column* of the transposed grid.
