facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Values are integers in the range 0-9.
  - observation: All input digit/colors are in the output.
  - observation: The transformation involves rearrangement of the values.
  - hypothesis: The transformation might involve rotation and reflection (mirroring).
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: 3x3 (in both examples)
          - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: 3x3 (in both examples)
          - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - actions:
      - name: rearrange
        description: Values are moved from their original positions to new positions.
  - relationships:
      - type: spatial
        description: The relationship between the input and output suggests a combination of 90 degree clockwise rotation, then flip vertically (reflection over the horizontal axis).
