The transformation seems to rearrange the input grid to produce the output grid. The dimensions of the grid remain consistent (e.g., 3x3 input becomes 3x3 output). The key seems to be a specific reordering or mirroring of the rows and/or columns, combined with a 90 degree rotation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This will effectively mean reading the first row from top to bottom to generate the rightmost column of the output.\n\n2. Reverse each column: in the rotated grid, reverse the order of the cells.\n\n3.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.\n\nIn other words, the transformation takes the bottom row and places each item into the left column of the output grid from bottom to top, repeating this operation for each column in the input and placing them in order into the rows in the output.\n"
