facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      All numbers (colors) present in the input grid are also present in the output grid.
  - observation: |
     The transformation does not seem to involve changing any numbers, just rearranging their position
  - observation: |
      Example 1: 3x3 input -> 3x3 output.
  - observation: |
      Example 2: 3x3 input -> 3x3 output.
  - hypothesis:  The transformation involves a rotation and/or mirroring of the rows.
  - hypothesis:  The top row of the input becomes the right-most column in the output, with the cells in reverse order.
  - hypothesis:  The middle row becomes the middle column, with cells in reverse order.
  - hypothesis:  The bottom row becomes the left column, with cells in reverse order.
