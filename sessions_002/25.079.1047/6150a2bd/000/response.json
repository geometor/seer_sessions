Continue reading in this manner - next row of input up becomes the next column of output, etc.\n4. This is the same as swapping rows and columns, with a top-to-bottom order of original rows being used for the output.\n\nIn simpler terms, it could be considered a flip-and-rotate transformation:\n1. flip the input grid upside down\n2. rotate the entire grid 90 degree clockwise, so the input's last row becomes the output's first column, etc.\n\nAnother way:\n1. Take the transpose of the input grid.\n2. Reverse the order of the rows of transposed grid.\n"
