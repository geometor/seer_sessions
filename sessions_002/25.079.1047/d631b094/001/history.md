Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be related to non-zero values in input grids. The zero values (white pixels) in the input grids appear to be background or insignificant. The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids.  It appears as if the non-zero values are extracted and formed into the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      elements: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    description: Identifies and extracts non-zero values from the input grid.
  - name: reshape
    description: Forms a new grid using only non-zero elements. The shape changes.

relationships:
  - input_grid-output_grid: The output_grid contains only the non-zero elements from the input_grid, reorganized.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with values other than 0.
2.  **Extract and Count:** Extract these non-zero pixels, and count the number of times each unique, non-zero value appears.
3. **Construct Output:** Construct a new output grid from this collection. Its length equals to total count of non-zero pixels.

Let's illustrate with `train_4`:
Input grid has one 8 at \[0,1], two 8s at \[1,0], \[1,1] and one more 8 at \[2,0]. Total number of non-zero elements is 4 and the non-zero value is 8.
Output is:


```
8 8 8 8
```
