The input grids are 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be related to non-zero values in input grids. The zero values (white pixels) in the input grids appear to be background or insignificant. The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids.  It appears as if the non-zero values are extracted and formed into the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
