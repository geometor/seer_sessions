The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example and 3x2 in the second example), the output just a rotation of the input. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or color manipulation; it's primarily a spatial/geometric transformation.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
