The order of rows seems inverted.\n* **Mirroring:** There is a potential of vertical mirroring/flipping.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"

Output the modified grid with the rows in reversed order, maintaining all the original values.\n\nEssentially, the transformation is a vertical flip (reflection across the horizontal axis) of the grid. The program takes the bottom row and makes it the top row, the second-to-last row becomes the second row, and so on, until the original top row becomes the bottom row. The values within each cell are preserved.\n"
