## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object documentation, and a natural language program description.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   **Reversal:** The rows of the input grid appear to be reversed in the output grid, and the values are maintained. The order of rows seems inverted.
* **Mirroring:** There is a potential of vertical mirroring/flipping.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input and output are grids of integers
    properties:
      - rows: variable number
      - columns: variable number
      - values: integers from 0-9 (representing colors)

  - type: transformation
    description: input grid is transformed to output grid
    actions:
      - reverse_rows: the order of rows is reversed
      - preserve_values: cell values (colors) are maintained during row reversal.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Reverse the order of the rows.
3.  Output the modified grid with the rows in reversed order, maintaining all the original values.

Essentially, the transformation is a vertical flip (reflection across the horizontal axis) of the grid. The program takes the bottom row and makes it the top row, the second-to-last row becomes the second row, and so on, until the original top row becomes the bottom row. The values within each cell are preserved.
