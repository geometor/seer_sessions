Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The task involves extracting and potentially replicating non-zero pixels from the input grid. The output grid seems to be constructed by listing all the non-black (non-zero) pixels from the input, and the number of times a non-black pixel appears to determine the dimensions of the output. Specifically, the number of times a distinct color appears is equal to product of the output dimensions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: true
      - pixel_values: [0-9]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: true
      - pixel_values: [0-9]
  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: pixel_list
    properties:
      - values: []

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zero
    input: input_grid
    output: non_zero_pixels
  - name: construct_output
    input: non_zero_pixels
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: input_grid is transformed to output_grid by extracting and replicating non-zero pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid.**
2.  **Identify all non-zero (non-black) pixels.**
3.  **Count the occurrences of each distinct non-zero pixel color.**
4. **Create output array using the non-zero pixel and the product of it's dimensions.**
5. **Fill output array with the found pixel.**

Example walkthrough (train\_4):

1.  **Input:** `0 8 0; 8 8 0; 8 0 0`
2.  **Non-zero pixels:** `8, 8, 8, 8`
3.  **Counts:** `8: 4`
4. **Output array size,** 4 = 2x2.
5. **Output** `8 8; 8 8`
