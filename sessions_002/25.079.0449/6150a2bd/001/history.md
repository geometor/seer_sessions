## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples and provide the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the grid remain the same (3x3 in the first example, and 3x3 in the second example, although it appears input is 2 x 3 and output is 3 x 3 - will need to confirm). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic operations on the numbers themselves, but rather a re-arrangement or mirroring of the grid elements, along with a rotation and reflection. The positions of the digits change, and it is critical that their positions relative to the entire image are considered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have values which are single digits.
  - observation: "In Example 1: the input grid has dimensions 3x3 and the output grid has dimensions 3x3"
  - observation: "In Example 2: the input grid has dimensions 2x3, the output grid 3x3"
  - observation: Grid values can be between 0-9, representing colours.
  - object: Input_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: 2D array of integers
  - object: Output_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: 2D array of integers
  - action: Transformation
    description: Rearranges the elements of the Input_Grid to produce the Output_Grid.
  - relationship: "Input_Grid is transformed into Output_Grid."
  - relationship: "The transformation includes reflection and rotation."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse the order of the rows** in the input grid.
2.  **Transpose the grid**. This exchanges rows and columns, equivalent to flipping the grid around the main diagonal.
3. **If the input had dimension**s 2 x 3, pad it to a 3 x 3 with zeroes *before* the transposition.

Essentially, the transformation is a reflection over both the horizontal and vertical axes (or a 180 degree rotation) of a padded input matrix, if required..
