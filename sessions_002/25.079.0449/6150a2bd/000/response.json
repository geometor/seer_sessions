The dimensions of the grid remain the same (3x3 in the first example, and 3x3 in the second example, although it appears input is 2 x 3 and output is 3 x 3 - will need to confirm). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic operations on the numbers themselves, but rather a re-arrangement or mirroring of the grid elements, along with a rotation and reflection. The positions of the digits change, and it is critical that their positions relative to the entire image are considered.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
