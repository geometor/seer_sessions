facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have values which are single digits.
  - observation: "In Example 1: the input grid has dimensions 3x3 and the output grid has dimensions 3x3"
  - observation: "In Example 2: the input grid has dimensions 2x3, the output grid 3x3"
  - observation: Grid values can be between 0-9, representing colours.
  - object: Input_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: 2D array of integers
  - object: Output_Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - values: 2D array of integers
  - action: Transformation
    description: Rearranges the elements of the Input_Grid to produce the Output_Grid.
  - relationship: "Input_Grid is transformed into Output_Grid."
  - relationship: "The transformation includes reflection and rotation."
