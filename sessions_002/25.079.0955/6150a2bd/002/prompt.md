"""
The transformation rule is a matrix transposition. The input grid is transposed to create the output grid. Specifically, the element at `input[row][column]` is moved to `output[column][row]` for all rows and columns. The digits do not change, it is their position in the array that changes.

    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array.  This makes transposition easy.
