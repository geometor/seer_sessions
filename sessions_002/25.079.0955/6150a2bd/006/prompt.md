The transformation rule is a vertical flip, or a reflection of the grid across its horizontal axis.  For each cell at `input[i][j]`, the corresponding cell in the output grid is `output[rows - 1 - i][j]`, where `rows` is the number of rows in the grid. This operation is equivalent to flipping the input grid upside down. This works for both square and rectangular grids.
