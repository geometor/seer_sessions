Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples and attempt to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements.
*   It appears the digits are being reordered and possibly rotated or reflected. The positions are mirrored with respect to the main diagonal.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object_type: "Grid cell"
  - property: "Value (0-9, representing a color)"
  - property: "Position (row, column)"
  - relationship: "Each input cell maps to a unique output cell."
  - action: "Transpose - rows of input become columns of output."
  - transformation: "The value at input[row][col] moves to output[col][row]."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a matrix transposition. The input grid is transposed to create the output grid. Specifically, the element at `input[row][column]` is moved to `output[column][row]` for all rows and columns. The digits do not change, it is their position in the array that changes.
