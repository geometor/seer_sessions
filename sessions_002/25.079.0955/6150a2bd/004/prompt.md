The transformation rule involves a mapping of indices from the input grid to the output grid. Specifically, the element at `input[i][j]` is moved to `output[j][rows - 1 - i]`, where `rows` is the number of rows in the input (and output) grid. In simpler terms, the row index of the input becomes the column index of the output. But the column index of the input becomes the *reversed* row index of the output: we take the total number of rows and subtract the input row index, and then subtract an additional 1, to get the output row index. This corresponds to a rotation by 90 degrees clockwise followed by vertical flip, or horizontal flip followed by a regular transpose.
