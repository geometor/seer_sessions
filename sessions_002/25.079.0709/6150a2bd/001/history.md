## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits, likely representing colored pixels.
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical within each pair (3x3 in the first, 3x3 in the second).
*   The digits in the input grid appear to be re-arranged in the output grid. The values are conserved, not changed, only moved in the grid.
*   The transformation seems to involve a consistent reordering of the input elements, not a conditional change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The digits/colors in the input are preserved in the output.
  - observation: The transformation involves rearranging the input grid's elements.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1 & 2)
      - elements: digits (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1 & 2)
      - elements: digits (0-9)
    actions:
      - type: rearrangement
        source: input_grid
        target: output_grid
  - relationship: element positions are changed consistently between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid, followed by reversing the order of the rows. Another way to think of it is:

1.  Transpose the input matrix (swap rows and columns).
2.  Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.

Or, an equivalent description:

1.  Reverse each row of the input matrix.
2. Transpose the modified matrix (swap rows and columns).

Or, a simple, accurate desciption

1. Reverse the order of the columns.
2. Reverse the order of the rows.
