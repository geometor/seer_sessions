facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The digits/colors in the input are preserved in the output.
  - observation: The transformation involves rearranging the input grid's elements.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (example 1 & 2)
      - elements: digits (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
