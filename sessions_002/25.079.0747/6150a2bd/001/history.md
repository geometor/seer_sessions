## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example, and both are 3x2 for the second example). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers, but rather a re-arrangement or mapping of the values based on their positions and potentially some other rule. The rule is a mirroring with an inversion.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "Values in the grid represent colors based on a predefined mapping."
  - object: "Grid"
    properties:
      - dimensions: "rows x columns"
      - elements: "single-digit integers (0-9)"
  - action: "Transformation"
    description: "Re-arranges grid elements based on a yet-to-be-determined rule which mirrors and rotates."
  - relationship: "Input grid maps to output grid via transformation rule."
  - observation: "The transformation reverses both rows and cols."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reverse Rows:** Take the input grid and reverse the order of its rows.  So, the first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
2.  **Reverse Columns:**  Take the resulting grid from step 1 and reverse the order of the elements *within each row*.  So, the first element of each row becomes the last, the second element becomes the second-to-last, and so on.
3.  The result of reversing both rows and columns is the output.

In more concise terms its a 180 degree rotation or performing a mirroring on the x and y axis.
