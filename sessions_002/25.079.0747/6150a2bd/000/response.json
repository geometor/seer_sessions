The dimensions of the input and output grids appear to be the same (both are 3x3 in the first example, and both are 3x2 for the second example). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic on the numbers, but rather a re-arrangement or mapping of the values based on their positions and potentially some other rule. The rule is a mirroring with an inversion.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
