## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task and provide my observations. Here's my breakdown of the example input-output pairs:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The values in the grids are rearranged between the input and output. It appears the values are being rotated in some way.
*	There doesn't seem to be a simple mirroring, values get shifted to completely different cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        train_1: 3x3
        train_2: 3x3
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    relationships:
        - input grid transforms to output grid
actions:
  - name: value_rearrangement
    description: The values within the grid are reordered based on a specific rule. It looks like a rotation
    details:
        - original x,y position of a value in the input maps to a new x', y' position in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observation:** The transformation appears to be a rotation of the grid. Specifically counter clockwise.
2.  **Transformation Rule:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise to obtain the output grid. The value that is at cell (x, y) in original grid, becomes (height-y-1,x) in new grid.
