Here's my breakdown of the example input-output pairs:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).\n*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n*   The values in the grids are rearranged between the input and output. It appears the values are being rotated in some way.\n*\tThere doesn't seem to be a simple mirroring, values get shifted to completely different cells.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
