Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs and outputs are grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same within each example pair, but different between example pairs (3x3 and 3x2).
*   The digits (colors) in the input grid appear to be rearranged in the output grid.
*   The order of the digits is reversed.
*    The rows and columns seem to be related.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions within each pair."
  - observation: "Digits in the input grid are rearranged in the output grid."
  - property: "Digits represent colors."
  - relationship: "Rows in input seem related to columns, mirrored, in the output"
  - action: "The sequence of elements is reversed"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  The input grid dimensions determine the output grid dimensions.
3.  Transpose the input matrix, switching rows to columns.
4.    Reverse the order of the transposed matrix

In other words, create the output grid by reading the input grid in reverse column-major order (or transposing, then reversing the order of the rows).
