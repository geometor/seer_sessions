The input grids consistently have a single non-zero color value surrounded by zeros (white pixels).  The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-zero color from the input grid, and the dimensions of the output grid vary. The key seems to be identifying the non-zero color and then constructing a new grid filled with that color, with the size of this new grid seemingly related to the *number* of instances of non-zero color in input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
