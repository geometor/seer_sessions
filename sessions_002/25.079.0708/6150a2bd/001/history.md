## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows, specifically a reversal of their order, and also possibly transposing the columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: variable (but consistent between input and output)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relation: transformation
    properties:
      - type: row_reversal
      - details: The order of rows in the input_grid is reversed in the output_grid. Also transposes the columns to rows and rows to columns.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Read** the input grid.
2.  **Reverse** the order of the rows.
3. **Transpose** the resulting grid
4.  **Output** the transformed grid.
