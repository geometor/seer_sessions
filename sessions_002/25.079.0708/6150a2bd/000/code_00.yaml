facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: variable (but consistent between input and output)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relation: transformation
    properties:
      - type: row_reversal
      - details: The order of rows in the input_grid is reversed in the output_grid. Also transposes the columns to rows and rows to columns.
