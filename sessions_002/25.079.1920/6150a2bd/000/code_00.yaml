facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: All input grid values are present in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation involves a rearrangement of the grid elements.
  - observation: "The transformation appears to be a mirroring of the input accross the axis of symmetry"
  - object: Input grid (2D array of integers)
  - object: Output grid (2D array of integers)
  - property: Grid dimensions (height, width)
  - property: Grid cell values (integers representing colors)
  - action: Rearrangement/Permutation of grid elements.
  - relationship: One-to-one mapping of input cell values to output cell values (same value, different position).
  - relationship: "The transformation appears to be a mirroring or a rotation of the input matrix"
