The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or external knowledge. It appears to be a rearrangement or remapping of the input grid's elements to form the output grid. The key seems to be a consistent spatial transformation or permutation of the grid elements. The colors are preserved during the transformation, so color is not changed - only the color position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
