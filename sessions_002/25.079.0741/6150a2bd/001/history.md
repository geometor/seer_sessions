## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (rows and columns lengths do not change). The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's elements, specifically a rotation and reflection, rather than a modification of the digits themselves. It looks like the grid is flipped or rotated. The colors (represented by the digits) stay the same; only their positions change.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3 #or 2
      cols: 3 # or 3
      elements: integers (0-9)
    relationships:
      - element_to_color: Each integer maps to a specific color (as defined in the COLOR_MAP).
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Rearranges the elements of the input grid to produce the output grid.
    details:
       - seems like a 90 degree rotation and reflection
       - input_position(row, col) -> output_position(new_row, new_col): there is a one-to-one mapping of the row and column before and after.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating the entire to the right by 90 degree, then reflecting it over its vertical axis (i.e. a "mirror" reflection, swap left and right). Another way to consider this combined transformation is a reflection along the main diagonal.
The algorithm would involve this transformation:
- for all input rows and cols
 - output_row = input_col
 - output_col = input_row

for example

input:

```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


rotate:

```
5 3 3
0 7 3
0 0 8
```


reflect over vertical axis


```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```
