"""
The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating the entire to the right by 90 degree, then reflecting it over its vertical axis (i.e. a "mirror" reflection, swap left and right). Another way to consider this combined transformation is a reflection along the main diagonal.
The algorithm would involve this transformation:
- for all input rows and cols
 - output_row = input_col
 - output_col = input_row
