The dimensions remain constant across the transformation.\n*   **Values:** The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   **Repetition:** Each row in both the input and output grids is identical. This strong repetition suggests a simple, consistent mapping between input and output values.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to be a one-to-one mapping of input values to output values. There's no apparent spatial reasoning, object manipulation, or complex arithmetic involved.  It seems each color in the input consistently maps to a specific color in the output, irrespective of its position.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each color in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding color in the output grid, according to a fixed mapping. The mapping is as follows:\n\n1.  Replace all occurrences of color 3 (green) with color 4 (yellow).\n2.  Replace all occurrences of color 1 (blue) with color 5 (gray).\n3.  Replace all occurrences of color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta).\n4.  Replace all occurrences of color 8 (azure) with color 9 (maroon).\n5.  Replace all occurrences of color 5 (gray) with color 1 (blue).\n6.  Replace all occurrences of color 6 (magenta) with color 2 (red).\n7.
