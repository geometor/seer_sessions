objects:
  - grid: A 3x3 matrix of pixels.
  - pixel: An individual cell within the grid, represented by a digit (0-9).
  - red_pixels: Pixels with the value 2.
  - output: a single digit, either 1 or 7.

properties:
  - color: The value of a pixel (0 for white, 2 for red).
  - position: the row and column of a pixel within a grid
  - count: The number of red pixels.
    
actions:
    -count_red_pixels: determine how many red pixels (value 2) exists

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The grid transforms into a single-digit output.
  - red_pixel_count_to_output: The number of red pixels seemingly determines the output value.
  - red_pixel_position_to_output: the position of the red may influence the output.
