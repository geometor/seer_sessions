The input grids are always 3x3, while the output grids vary in size. The transformation seems to involve extracting specific non-zero colored pixels from the input grid and constructing a new grid with those pixels, potentially repeating them. The surrounding zeros in the input seem to be irrelevant. The key is the non-zero values.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
