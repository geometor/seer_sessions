facts:
  - observation: Input grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid size varies.
  - observation: Input grids contain zeros and a single non-zero color.
  - observation: The output grid contains only the non-zero color from the input.
  - observation: The non-zero color in the output is repeated.
  - observation: The number of times the color repeats is related to the number of time it occur in the input.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      elements: integers (same as non-zero input element)
  - action: extract_non_zero_color
    description: Identifies the single non-zero color in the input grid.
  - action: repeat_color
    description: Repeats extracted non-zero colors to form output.
  - relationship: The number of repetitions appears to be the sum of number of time the non-zero color occurs in input grid.
