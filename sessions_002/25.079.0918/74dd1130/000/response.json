The transformation seems to involve rearranging the columns of the input grid to produce the output grid. The specific rearrangement rule needs to be determined, but it doesn't appear to involve any changes to the individual cell values (colors) themselves, just their positions. It's a permutation of columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
