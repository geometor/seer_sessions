            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code, designed to swap the second and third columns, fails on all provided examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis, while potentially on the right track for *some* transformation, doesn't capture the complete rule governing the input-output relationship across all examples. The strategy will involve a closer examination of *all* examples to discern a more comprehensive pattern, likely involving more than a simple column swap. We need to shift from a narrow focus on the initial example to a broader, comparative analysis of all input-output pairs.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Comparative Analysis:** Systematically compare each input grid to its corresponding output grid, pixel by pixel.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for consistent changes or relationships that hold true across *all* examples. This might involve:\n    *   Specific color changes.\n    *   Row or column manipulations beyond simple swapping.\n    *   Conditional changes based on pixel values or positions.\n    *   Object based changes (recoloring, moving, etc)\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the identified patterns, formulate a revised natural language program that accurately describes the transformation.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** Generate new code based on the refined hypothesis and repeat the testing process.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Develop Reports (using code execution when appropriate):**\n\nI will present the comparative analysis in YAML format, which should be helpful when defining the transformation rule.\n\n"
