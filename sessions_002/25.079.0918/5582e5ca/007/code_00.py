"""
1.  Examine Input Grid: Analyze the input grid to determine the count of each color present.
2.  Identify Most Frequent Color: Find the color that occurs most frequently within the input grid. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, further analysis might be needed (but this isn't the case in these examples).
3.  Create Output Grid: Create a new grid (output grid) with the same dimensions (rows and columns) as the input grid.
4.  Fill Output Grid: Fill every cell of the output grid with the most frequent color identified in step 2.
5.  Return Output Grid: Return the newly created and filled output grid.
