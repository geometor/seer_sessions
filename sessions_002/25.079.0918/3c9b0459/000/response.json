The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex shapes, object interactions, or external knowledge. It appears to be a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid elements. The colors themselves don't seem to have inherent meaning beyond their role as distinct identifiers.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
