Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The output grids consist primarily of `0` (white) and `5` (gray) values. The transformation seems to be based on replacing entire rows of the input grid with a row of `5`s or `0`s, depending on the input row's content.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids contain only 0 and 5 values.
  - object: input_row
    property: all_same
    description: All elements in the row have the same value.
    action: replace_with_fives (if all_same is true), replace_with_zeros (if all_same is false).
  - rule: If all elements in an input row are identical, the corresponding output row is all 5s.
  - rule: If elements in the input row are not all identical, the corresponding output is all 0s.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if all the values within the current row are identical.
3.  **If** all values in the row are the same, **replace** the entire corresponding row in the output grid with `5`s (gray).
4.  **Otherwise**, if the values in the row are *not* all the same, **replace** the entire corresponding row in the output grid with `0`s (white).
5.  **Return** the modified output grid.
