It appears that some non-zero pixels in the input grid are influencing the output grid. It seems the transformation involves some kind of filling or extension of values based on others in the grid. It looks like values in the last column are added as a new column, and all rows below the first row take the value in the first column of the row above it.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
