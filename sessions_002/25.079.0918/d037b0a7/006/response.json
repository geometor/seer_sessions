            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding from the first example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies. The core issue seems to be an over-generalization of the rules, especially regarding propagating values down columns. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each example pair. Identify precisely where the code's logic deviates from the expected transformation.\n2.  **Refine the Rules:** Adjust the natural language program to account for the observed discrepancies. Be more specific about the conditions under which values are copied or propagated.\n3.  **Prioritize Column-Specific Rules:** The transformations seem to be largely column-specific. We should focus on defining independent rules for each column. The current program has some interactions between the columns that should be minimized.\n4. Use a lowest-common-denominator approach for propagation.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Analysis (using code execution for confirmation when necessary)**\n\nWe will use the shape for comparison and pixel-by-pixel values, specifically in places where the transformation did not produce the expected outcome.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Expected Output Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Transformed Output Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Discrepancy:**  The value '6' in the top right corner (0,2) should have been copied down the entire third column. The transformed output correctly copied the '6' to (1,2), but not to (2,2).  Also, (1,1) which should be a 4, got a 0.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Expected Output Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Transformed Output Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Discrepancy:** The '7' in the second row, first column (1,0) should have copied down to (2,0)., and instead it ended up at (2,0). The '2' in the first row, second column was correctly copied to (1,1) and(2,1). The '8' in the (0,2) was appropriately copied to (1,2) but should also have been copied to (2,2).\n\n**Example 3 Analysis**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Expected Output Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Transformed Output Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Discrepancy:** The '4' was correctly propagated to (1,0) and (2,0). The 2 did not get propagated from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
