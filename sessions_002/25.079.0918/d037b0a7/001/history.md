## train_1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
4 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
4 0 0
4 2 0
4 2 0
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and try to understand the underlying transformation rule.

Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. It appears that some non-zero pixels in the input grid are influencing the output grid. It seems the transformation involves some kind of filling or extension of values based on others in the grid. It looks like values in the last column are added as a new column, and all rows below the first row take the value in the first column of the row above it.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid_transformation
    description: Input grid is transformed into an output grid.
  - object: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9
      - position: row and column indices
  - action: filling
    description: Certain pixels in the output grid take the value of last col, other pixels are unchanged.
  - relationship: columns
    description: >-
      The last column of the input is important. A new column is added
      and all values below row 1 are set to the value above in first col.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Last Column:** Find the rightmost column in the input grid.
2.  **Add a new column** Create a new, blank, column, adjacent to the last column, with same value as the last column
3. **Iterate from Second Row**: Start from the second row (index 1) and go through each subsequent row.
4.   **Fill First Column**: For the cell in first column in all rows except the first, change the value to the pixel above it in the first column of the input
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels**: Any pixel and not one of the new one described keep their value
6. Return new array
