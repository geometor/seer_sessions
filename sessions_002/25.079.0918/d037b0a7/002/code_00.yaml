facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example shows a transformation of a grid. The output grid's first column,
      starting from the second row, takes values from the input grid's first column,
      shifted down by one row. The output grid has an additional column, which is an exact
      copy of the first column of the *output* grid after the shift.

  - actions:
    - action: shift_down
      description: |
        Elements of the input grid's first column are moved down by one position.
        The first element of the first column is unchanged.
    - action: copy_column
      description: |
          The output grid's new last column takes on the same values of the modified first column.
    - action: add_column
      description: A new column is added to the grid
  - constraints:
    - constraint: The first row of the first column remains unchanged.
    - constraint: other columns remain unchanged, except for the last column which is new
