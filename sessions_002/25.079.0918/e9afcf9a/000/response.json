Both grids have two rows.  The input grids consist of two rows, each filled with a single, repeating color. The output grid appears to be an interleaving of the colors from the input rows, creating a checkerboard-like pattern in each row, and each column is swapping the color in the first and second row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The colors in the two rows are different.\n\n2.  **Interleave Row Colors:** Create the first row of the output grid by taking alternating colors from the first and the second rows of the input grid, starting with the color from the first row.\n\n3. **Interleave and swap Row Colors:** Create the second row of the output grid by taking alternating colors from the first and the second rows of the input grid. Starting color is taken from the second color in the first output row. Or it is simpler to say: swap colors in the row from top to bottom.\n\n4.  **Output:** The result is a new grid, where colors in the first row are the original first and second row's colors, interleaved and the second row is the swapped version of the first.\n"
