## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```


**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
8 8 8 8 8 8
```


**output:**
```
4 8 4 8 4 8
8 4 8 4 8 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have two rows.  The input grids consist of two rows, each filled with a single, repeating color. The output grid appears to be an interleaving of the colors from the input rows, creating a checkerboard-like pattern in each row, and each column is swapping the color in the first and second row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 2
      columns: 6
      elements: color values
      row1: [same color]
      row2: [same color, different from row1]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 2
      columns: 6
      elements: color values
      description: Interleaved colors from input_grid rows

actions:
  - name: interleave_colors
    description: Alternate colors from input_grid rows to form output_grid rows and the rows themselves are swapped.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
    - type: transformation
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid
      method: interleave_colors, swap_rows
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Rows:** The input grid has two rows. Each row consists of a single, repeating color. The colors in the two rows are different.

2.  **Interleave Row Colors:** Create the first row of the output grid by taking alternating colors from the first and the second rows of the input grid, starting with the color from the first row.

3. **Interleave and swap Row Colors:** Create the second row of the output grid by taking alternating colors from the first and the second rows of the input grid. Starting color is taken from the second color in the first output row. Or it is simpler to say: swap colors in the row from top to bottom.

4.  **Output:** The result is a new grid, where colors in the first row are the original first and second row's colors, interleaved and the second row is the swapped version of the first.
