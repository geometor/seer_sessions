The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and potentially a change of order or orientation. There's no clear indication of color modification (changing of numbers), just re-ordering and possibly rotation. The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in both examples.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
