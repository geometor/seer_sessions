facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The transformation involves re-arrangement of rows.
  - observation: numbers (colors) themselves are preserved, no new numbers are introduced, and no numbers from the input disappear.
  - observation: there is some form of rotation or reflection, the orientation switches in both examples from starting top to bottom to ending bottom to top.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 in example 1, 3x3 in example 2.
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9).
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as corresponding input_grid.
      - elements: same set of integers as input_grid, but re-arranged.
  - action: row_rearrangement
    description: Rows of the input_grid are reordered and potentially rotated/reflected to form the output_grid.
