Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed adjustments to the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial transformation rule (transpose and reverse rows) was too simplistic and only coincidentally aligned with the first example. The second example clearly demonstrates that the transformation is not a simple matrix operation. It appears the core concept is a *rotation* of the grid, specifically a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The pixel value errors in the initial attempts are a direct result of the incorrect transformation, since we were moving entire rows/columns when pixels need to be moved based on their new positions in rotated coordinates.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Discard Incorrect Operations:** The current transpose and row-reversal operations are not part of the correct transformation and should be removed.
2.  **Implement Rotation:** The correct transformation is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. We need to calculate the new coordinates for each pixel after the rotation.
3.  **Verify with Examples:**  The implementation must be tested against all provided examples to confirm its correctness.

**Metrics and Analysis (using manual visual inspection and logic, as code execution is for the *coder* phase):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Original dimensions: 3x3
    *   Rotated dimensions: 3x3 (rotation preserves dimensions)
    *   Visual inspection confirms the output SHOULD be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The current output is incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Original dimensions: 3x2
    *   Rotated dimensions: 2x3 (rotation swaps dimensions)
    *   Visual inspection confirms the output SHOULD be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The current output is incorrect.

**YAML Fact Block:**

facts:
  - task_id: 6150a2bd
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - elements: integer values (0-9, representing colors)
  - transformation_type: rotation
    properties:
      - angle: 90 degrees
      - direction: counter-clockwise
  - actions:
      - rotate_grid:
          input: original grid
          output: rotated grid
          details: Each pixel (x, y) in the original grid maps to a new position (y, rows - 1 - x) in the rotated grid, and vice versa.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A grid of pixels with dimensions *rows* x *columns*.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3. **Rotation Details:**
    *   The number of rows in the output grid will be the number of *columns* in the input grid.
    *   The number of columns in the output grid will be the number of *rows* in the input grid.
    *   Each pixel at position (x, y) in the input grid will move to position (y, rows - 1 - x) in the rotated (output) grid. The pixel at (0,0) moves to (0, R-1).
4.  **Output:** The rotated grid.
