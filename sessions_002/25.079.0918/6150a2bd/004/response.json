            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed adjustments to the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial transformation rule (transpose and reverse rows) was too simplistic and only coincidentally aligned with the first example. The second example clearly demonstrates that the transformation is not a simple matrix operation. It appears the core concept is a *rotation* of the grid, specifically a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The pixel value errors in the initial attempts are a direct result of the incorrect transformation, since we were moving entire rows/columns when pixels need to be moved based on their new positions in rotated coordinates.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Discard Incorrect Operations:** The current transpose and row-reversal operations are not part of the correct transformation and should be removed.\n2.  **Implement Rotation:** The correct transformation is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. We need to calculate the new coordinates for each pixel after the rotation.\n3.  **Verify with Examples:**  The implementation must be tested against all provided examples to confirm its correctness.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using manual visual inspection and logic, as code execution is for the *coder* phase):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Original dimensions: 3x3\n    *   Rotated dimensions: 3x3 (rotation preserves dimensions)\n    *   Visual inspection confirms the output SHOULD be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The current output is incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Original dimensions: 3x2\n    *   Rotated dimensions: 2x3 (rotation swaps dimensions)\n    *   Visual inspection confirms the output SHOULD be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The current output is incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
