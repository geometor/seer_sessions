The transformation seems to rearrange the input grid to produce the output grid. The dimensions of the grid remain consistent (3x3 in the first example, and 3x3 in the second example). The core operation seems to be a mirroring and exchange of values based on their positions, possibly some kind of reflection or rotation.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"
