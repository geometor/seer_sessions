## train_1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```


**output:**
```
1 1
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
2 0 0

```


**output:**
```
2 2 2
```


## train_3

**input:**
```
0 7 0
0 0 0

```


**output:**
```

## train_4

**input:**
```

**output:**
```

```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color.
*   The outputs are smaller grids, also containing digits/colors.
*   The outputs seem to be related to non-zero values, specifically, the arrangement of the non zero values in input.
*   There is a single non-zero color in the input.
*   The non-zero color in the input populates the output.
*   Zeros represent the white background in the input.
*   The output grids size expands according the number of occurrences of that non-zero value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - input_type: "grid"
  - output_type: "grid"
  - input_size: "3x3"
  - colors:
    - "0: white"
    - "1: blue"
    - "2: red"
    - "7: orange"
    - "8: azure"
  - objects:
    - "non-zero colored pixels in the input grid"
  - actions:
    - "Identify the non-zero color."
    - "Count the occurrences of the identified non-zero color in input grid."
    - "Construct output grid based on occurrences of the non-zero color."
  - relationships:
    - "Output color corresponds to the non-zero input color."
    - "Output grid dimensions is related to number of times non-zero color appears in input grid"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the single non-zero color in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of times this non-zero color appears in the input grid.
3. **Create** output grid using the non-zero color from step 1:
    *   if the non-zero color appears twice, the output is a 1x2 grid
    *   if the non-zero color appears 3 times, the output grid is a 1x3 grid, etc.
4.  **Populate** the output grid completely with the identified non-zero color.
