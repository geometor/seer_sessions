The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements to form the output grid. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (e.g., 3x3 in the first example, 3x3 in the second example). There's a mirroring or rotation-like effect, but it's not a simple 90-degree rotation or standard reflection. The colors (represented by numbers) seem to be preserved, just reordered. It appears to involve a diagonal flip/transpose with mirroring or reverse-order effect.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

This means the element at `input[row][col]` moves to `temp[col][row]`, where `temp` is the temporary grid after transposing.\n2.  **Reverse Rows:** After transposing, reverse the order of elements in each row of the `temp` grid. This means for each row in `temp`, swap element 0 with element (width-1), element 1 with element (width -2), etc. stopping when the pointers cross. The result will produce the output grid.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation flips the grid along its main diagonal and then reverses each row. This effectively results in swapping rows and cols, and then mirrors the elements in each row, that produces the output grid.\n"
