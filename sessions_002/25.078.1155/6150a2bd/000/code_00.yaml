facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - observation: "The values (colors) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid."
  - observation: "The transformation involves a reordering of elements."
  - relationship: "Elements seem to be flipped diagonally and then maybe mirrored."
  - property: "Input Grid 1 dimensions: 3x3"
  - property: "Output Grid 1 dimensions: 3x3"
  - property: "Input Grid 2 dimensions: 3x3"
  - property: "Output Grid 2 dimensions: 3x3"
  - action: "Reordering of elements based on a diagonal flip and possible horizontal reflection of rows"
