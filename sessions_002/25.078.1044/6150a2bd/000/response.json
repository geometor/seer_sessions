Here's my breakdown of the input-output examples:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the input grid's rows and a change of their order. It looks like a rotation or reflection of the grid, along with specific movements of the colored regions, not just a simple 90-degree rotation, however. The colors(numbers) maintain their association during movement, and the order looks reversed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The first input row becomes the last output column, and the last input row becomes the first output column.\n2.  **Read Rows, Write Columns:** Take the values in the input grid row by row and read it into the output, column by column, top to bottom. Starting with the *last* row read into the *first* column. Then the next to last input row to the second output column, and the first input row to the last output column.\n\nIn short form, the transformation is a reflection of the values along the diagonal that goes bottom left to top right.\n"
