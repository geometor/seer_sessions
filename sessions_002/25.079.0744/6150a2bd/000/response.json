The transformation doesn't involve creating new colors/digits; it appears to be a rearrangement or remapping of the existing ones. The most striking observation is that the input grid is rotated and potentially mirrored.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, a clockwise rotation.\n  - hypothesis: testing - transposing then reversing rows.\n```"

This effectively rotates the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise and mirrors it.\n2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of elements within each row of the transposed grid. This completes a 90 degrees clockwise rotation.\n3.  The resulting grid is the output.\n\nIn simpler terms, rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the output grid.\n"
