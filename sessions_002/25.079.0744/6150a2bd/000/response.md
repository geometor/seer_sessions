Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't involve creating new colors/digits; it appears to be a rearrangement or remapping of the existing ones. The most striking observation is that the input grid is rotated and potentially mirrored.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The values (colors) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation is a spatial rearrangement of the grid elements.
  - hypothesis: The transformation appears to be a rotation.  Specifically, a clockwise rotation.
  - hypothesis: testing - transposing then reversing rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Transpose:** Swap rows and columns of the input grid. This effectively rotates the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise and mirrors it.
2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of elements within each row of the transposed grid. This completes a 90 degrees clockwise rotation.
3.  The resulting grid is the output.

In simpler terms, rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the output grid.
