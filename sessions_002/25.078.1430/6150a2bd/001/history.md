## train_1

**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve rearranging the elements (pixels) of the input grid to form the output grid, based on their values. The core operation appears to be a reordering or sorting, potentially based on rows and colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (train_1), 3x3 (train_2)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - type: row
    properties:
      - length: 3
  - type: element_value
    properties:
      - value_range: 0-9
    relationship: represents color

actions:
  - name: reorder
    description: Elements of the input grid are rearranged to form the output grid.
    parameters:
      - based_on: element values, row-wise

relationships:
  - type: element-color
    description: Each digit corresponds to a specific color (as per the provided color map).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid row by row.
2.  Treat each row as a set of elements.
3.  Reorder the entire set of elements from all rows based on their integer values *in descending order*.
4. Reconstruct the output grid row by row with the sorted elements. Each output row has length equal to the input row length. Fill rows from right to left with descending elements.
5. The dimensions of output grid are the same as the input grid.

Essentially, the input grid is flattened, values sorted descending and assembled back into rows of same width filling the positions from right to left.
