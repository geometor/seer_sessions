The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve rearranging the elements (pixels) of the input grid to form the output grid, based on their values. The core operation appears to be a reordering or sorting, potentially based on rows and colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
