Okay, I'm ready to analyze these input-output examples and discern the transformation logic. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The inputs are square grids of varying sizes (3x3 in the examples).
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   The outputs are also grids, but smaller in size than the inputs.
*   The outputs seem to be related to non-zero elements on the border of the input grid.
* the colors in input and output are the same

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grids are square and 3x3.
    attributes:
      - size: variable (3x3)
      - cells: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - type: grid
    description: Output grids are smaller than input grids.
    attributes:
      - size: variable (smaller than input)
      - cells: single-digit integers (matching input colors)
  - type: object_identification
    description: non zero colors on the border of the grid.
  - type: relationship
    description: Output grid contains color values present on the borders.
  - type: transformation
    description: collect all border colors to form one row in the output.
    rule: "border_colors * count"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Border Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels that are on the border (top, bottom, left, or right edges).
2.  **Extract non-zero colors:** Extract the color values from the non zero border pixels, make them the same.
3.    **Count Border colors**: Count the occurences of each non zero color.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new output grid. The new grid will only contain one row.
    Construct the new grid by repeating each color based on it's occurrences.
