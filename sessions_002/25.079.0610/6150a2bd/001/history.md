## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex shapes or patterns, but rather a rearrangement of the existing elements. The positions of the numbers are changing, and it appears that the input grid is being rotated or mirrored in some way.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: |
      All values present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, and vice-versa.
  - observation: |
      The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the grid elements.
  - observation: |
      The examples suggest a rotation, specifically a counter-clockwise rotation.
  - object_type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - rotated counter-clockwise
    relationships:
      - input_grid: transformed to output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. This means that each element (i, j) in the input grid moves to the position (j, N-1-i) in the output grid, where N is the number of rows (which is equal to the number of columns). The values of numbers in the input array maintain in place after rotation.
