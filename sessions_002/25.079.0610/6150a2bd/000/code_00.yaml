facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: |
      All values present in the input grid are also present in the output grid, and vice-versa.
  - observation: |
      The transformation appears to be a spatial rearrangement of the grid elements.
  - observation: |
      The examples suggest a rotation, specifically a counter-clockwise rotation.
