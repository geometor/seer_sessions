            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"Reverse Rows\" and \"Sort Values by inverse value\") and the corresponding Python code are partially correct in that they reverse the order of the rows. However, the \"Sort Values\" part is misinterpreting the actual transformation. The provided code sorts and remaps *all* pixel values based on their magnitude, whereas the examples suggest a more localized remapping or conditional change of pixel values. The core issue is that the sorting/remapping logic is too broad and doesn't account for the specific context-dependent color changes observed in the examples. The strategy should shift from a global sort to understanding the *conditions* under which specific pixel values change.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Abandon Global Sorting:** The current approach of globally sorting all pixel values is incorrect. We need to discard this.\n2.  **Focus on Conditional Changes:** Instead of sorting, we need to identify *when* and *why* specific pixel values change. This involves looking for patterns related to position, adjacency, and original values.\n3.  **Per-Example Analysis:** We'll analyze each example pair (input/expected output) meticulously, noting the specific changes and looking for consistent rules.\n4.  **Object Identification:** While pixel-level operations are key, identifying larger structures or \"objects\" (contiguous regions of the same color) might reveal higher-level rules.\n5. **Iterative Refinement**: I will refine the process.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and mental calculation for now, will add `tool_code` later if needed):**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    "
