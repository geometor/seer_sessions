facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      All input grid integer values exist on output grid.
  - observation: |
      The transformation is a rearrangement of elements with no change in values.
  - observation: |
      In example 1, input grid values are reordered by inverse value
       i.e. 8 -> 0, 7 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 0 -> 5.
  - observation: |
      In example 1, the columns are mirrored top to bottom.
  - observation: |
      In example 2, the columns are mirrored top to bottom.
  - observation: |
      In example 2, input grid values are reordered by inverse value
       i.e. 5 -> 2, 2 -> 5, 1 -> 1, 0 -> 0
