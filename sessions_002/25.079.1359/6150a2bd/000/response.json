The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex image manipulations, but rather a rearrangement of the existing elements based on some rule related to their values and/or positions. The values are preserved meaning that the colors in input are the same colors in output. The key focus is to identify the mapping of colors position from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
