## train_1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```


**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```


## train_2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```


**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, including my perception of the elements, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements.
*   The input numbers appear in reverse order of the output numbers.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description: |
  Rearranges elements of a 2D grid.
elements:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (variable)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - representation: 2D array
transformation_type: rearrangement
observations:
  - input_output_dimensions_match: true
  - element_reordering: true
  - reverse_order: "input numbers are reversed in the output"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions.
3.  Iterate through the *input* grid in reverse order from bottom-right to top-left (i.e., iterate starting from the last row, last column and moving up rows and then left columns).
4.  Iterate through the *output* grid, writing values from input, from top-left to bottom-right (standard iteration)

The transformation rule is to reverse the writing direction - the numbers present in the input are mirrored into the output location.
