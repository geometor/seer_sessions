The input grid transforms into the output grid, and it appears the transformation involves some kind of rotation and/or reflection along with a reordering of the rows. The dimensions of the grid seem to stay consistent (e.g., a 3x3 input becomes a 3x3 output). The values also are preserved - but their locations change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

What were rows are now columns and vice-versa.
