The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements, specifically a rotation or reflection, combined with a consistent change or reordering of positions. The colors themselves do not change, only their positions in a mirrored/reverse row order.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
