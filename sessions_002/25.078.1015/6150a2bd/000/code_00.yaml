task_description: |
  The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions. 
  The transformation appears to be a rotation or reordering along with reversal of rows.
objects:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
  - pixels: Individual cells within the grid, each holding a single-digit integer value.
properties:
  - color: The integer value of a pixel, representing its color (0-9).
  - position: The row and column coordinates of a pixel within the grid.
actions:
  - reorder: Changing the positions of pixels within the grid.
  - mirror/reverse: swap the rows
relationships:
  - input_output_dimension_equality: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - color_preservation: The colors (pixel values) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, though their positions change.
