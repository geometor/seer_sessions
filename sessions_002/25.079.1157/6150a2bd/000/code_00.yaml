facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: All numbers present in the input grid are also present in the output grid.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be a rearrangement of the input grid's elements.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (where m and n are integers)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: m x n (same as input_grid)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9), same set as input_grid
  - action: transformation
    description: Rearranges the elements of the input_grid to produce the output_grid.
    type: permutation
  - relationship: input_output_correspondence
    description: Each element in the input_grid has a corresponding position in the output_grid.
