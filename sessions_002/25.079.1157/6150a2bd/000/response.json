The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex arithmetic or external knowledge. It appears to be a rearrangement or mirroring of the input grid. The positions of the numbers are changing, but the numbers themselves are preserved, suggesting a permutation-based transformation rather than a calculation. The consistent dimensions of input and output are critical.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
