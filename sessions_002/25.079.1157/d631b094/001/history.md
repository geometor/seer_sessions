Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements of the Task:**

The task appears to involve extracting specific colored pixels from the input grid and reconstructing a new grid based on those pixels. The surrounding black (0) pixels seem to be ignored, acting as a background. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-black pixels from the input, with the dimensions of output seemingly related to the number of targeted pixels in the input, but collapsed as much as possible. The non-zero pixels determine the color.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3, with a black background (value 0).
  - observation: Each input grid contains one or more pixels of a single non-black color.
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-black color from the corresponding input grid.
  - observation: The output grid is smaller than the input grid, but the dimensions change.
  - object: Non-black pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (1, 2, 7, 8 in the examples).
      action: "Copied to output grid"
  - object: "Black pixels in the input"
    properties:
       color: "Black/0"
       action: "ignored"
  - relationship: "The output grid size is always square, the length of each dimension is equal to the number of non-black pixels in a row or column, whichever is most numerous (not strictly)."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Examine the input grid and identify the single non-black color present.
2.  **Count Non-Black Pixels:** Count how often this color appears in the input.
3. **Determine size:** Inspect the input grid and count the largest grouping of the target color either in a row or column. This is length of a dimension in the output grid.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new square grid, where each dimension is equal to calculated value from step 3. Fill every cell of this new grid with the target color identified in step 1.
