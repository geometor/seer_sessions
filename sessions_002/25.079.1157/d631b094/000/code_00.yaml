facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 3x3, with a black background (value 0).
  - observation: Each input grid contains one or more pixels of a single non-black color.
  - observation: Output grids contain only the non-black color from the corresponding input grid.
  - observation: The output grid is smaller than the input grid, but the dimensions change.
  - object: Non-black pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color: Varies (1, 2, 7, 8 in the examples).
      action: "Copied to output grid"
  - object: "Black pixels in the input"
    properties:
       color: "Black/0"
       action: "ignored"
  - relationship: "The output grid size is always square, the length of each dimension is equal to the number of non-black pixels in a row or column, whichever is most numerous (not strictly)."
