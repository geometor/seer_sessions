The surrounding black (0) pixels seem to be ignored, acting as a background. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-black pixels from the input, with the dimensions of output seemingly related to the number of targeted pixels in the input, but collapsed as much as possible. The non-zero pixels determine the color.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
