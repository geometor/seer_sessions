Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).\n*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.\n*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements.\n*   The specific rearrangement appears to be a rotation or reflection, as the relative positions of the numbers change.\n*    It looks like the grid is rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees. The bottom row becomes the right-most column, The middle row stays in the middle, the top row becomes the left-most column.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
