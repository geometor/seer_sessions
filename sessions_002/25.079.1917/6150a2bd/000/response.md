Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (representing colors).
*   The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical in each example pair.
*   The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the input grid's elements.
*   The specific rearrangement appears to be a rotation or reflection, as the relative positions of the numbers change.
*    It looks like the grid is rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees. The bottom row becomes the right-most column, The middle row stays in the middle, the top row becomes the left-most column.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (train_1), 3x3 (train_2)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Rearranges grid elements.
    details: Appears to be a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.
relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: Input grid transforms into output grid via the specified action.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input grid.
2.  Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    *   The bottom row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output.
    *   The middle row of the input becomes the middle column of the output.
    *  The top row of the input becomes the leftmost column of the output.
3.  The result is the output grid.
